did the evaluation part for the information retrieval and the RAG

## Before The Start
the `data.json` file in directory `data` is missing, to generate it, run the `embed_and_store.py` at the directory `data`

## UI
the `main.py` file located in `UI` folder starts the UI interface once finishing loading the model.

This directory contains the User Interface components of our project.

## Evaluation
the json for evaluation is already generated in folder `output`, to re-generate it, run the `evaluate.py` at the root folder. To evaluate the rag, run the `Evaluation/evaluate_method1.py`. To evaluate the IR, run `data/IR_evaluation_numpy.ipynb`
