      "content": "Based on the provided snippets, mindfulness practices have been associated with various positive effects on brain structure and function. Studies suggest that mindfulness is negatively associated with envy and that mindfulness may reduce decline in specific cognitive domains and brain structure, slow the decline of fluid intelligence, and increase resilience in brain functional architecture. Additionally, mindfulness has been found to be significantly and negatively correlated with envy, and mindfulness training was associated with higher 'ability' emotional intelligence. Furthermore, mindfulness was positively correlated with fluid intelligence, resilience, and global network efficiency in middle-aged yoga and meditation practitioners."
