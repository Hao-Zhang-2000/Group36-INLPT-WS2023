{"abstracts": ["In the past ten years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedicine has increased rapidly, which roots in the rapid growth of biomedicine data, the improvement of computing performance, and the development of deep learning methods. At present, there are great difficulties in front of AI for solving complex and comprehensive medical problems. Ontology can play an important role in how to make machines have stronger intelligence and has wider applications in the medical field. By using ontologies, (meta) data can be standardized so that data quality is improved and more data analysis methods can be introduced, data integration can be supported by the semantics relationships which are specified in ontologies, and effective logic expression in nature language can be better understood by machine. This can be a pathway to stronger AI. Under this circumstance, the Chinese Conference on Biomedical Ontology and Terminology was held in Beijing in autumn 2019, with the theme \"Making Machine Understand Data\". The success of this conference further improves the development of ontology in the field of biomedical information in China, and will promote the integration of Chinese ontology research and application with the international standards and the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability(FAIR) Data Principle.", "Neuromorphic visual sensory and memory systems, which can perceive, process, and memorize optical information, represent core technology for artificial intelligence and robotics with autonomous navigation. An optoelectronic synapse with an elegant integration of biometric optical sensing and synaptic learning functions can be a fundamental element for the hardware-implementation of such systems. Here, we report a class of ferroelectric field-effect memristive transistors made of a two-dimensional WS2 semiconductor atop a ferroelectric PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin film for optoelectronic synaptic devices. The WS2 channel exhibits voltage- and light-controllable memristive switching, dependent on the optically and electrically tunable ferroelectric domain patterns in the underlying PZT layer. These devices consequently show the emulation of optically driven synaptic functionalities including both short- and long-term plasticity as well as the implementation of brainlike learning rules. Integration of these rich synaptic functionalities into one single artificial optoelectronic device could allow the development of future neuromorphic electronics capable of optical information sensing and learning.", "The do-calculus is a well-known deductive system for deriving connections between interventional and observed distributions, and has been proven complete for a number of important identifiability problems in causal inference [1, 8, 18]. Nevertheless, as it is currently defined, the do-calculus is inapplicable to causal problems that involve complex nested counterfactuals which cannot be expressed in terms of the \"do\" operator. Such problems include analyses of path-specific effects and dynamic treatment regimes. In this paper we present the potential outcome calculus (po-calculus), a natural generalization of do-calculus for arbitrary potential outcomes. We thereby provide a bridge between identification approaches which have their origins in artificial intelligence and statistics, respectively. We use po-calculus to give a complete identification algorithm for conditional path-specific effects with applications to problems in mediation analysis and algorithmic fairness.", "Differentiation of intelligence refers to changes in the structure of intelligence that depend on individuals' level of general cognitive ability (ability differentiation hypothesis) or age (developmental differentiation hypothesis). The present article aimed to investigate ability differentiation, developmental differentiation, and their interaction with nonlinear factor analytic models in 2 studies. Study 1 was comprised of a nationally representative sample of 7,127 U.S. students (49.4% female; Mage = 14.51, SD = 1.42, range = 12.08-17.00) who completed the computerized adaptive version of the Armed Service Vocational Aptitude Battery. Study 2 analyzed the norming sample of the Berlin Intelligence Structure Test with 1,506 German students (44% female; Mage = 14.54, SD = 1.35, range = 10.00-18.42). Results of Study 1 supported the ability differentiation hypothesis but not the developmental differentiation hypothesis. Rather, the findings pointed to age-dedifferentiation (i.e., higher correlations between different abilities with increasing age). There was evidence for an interaction between age and ability differentiation, with greater ability differentiation found for older adolescents. Study 2 provided little evidence for ability differentiation but largely replicated the findings for age dedifferentiation and the interaction between age and ability differentiation. The present results provide insight into the complex dynamics underlying the development of intelligence structure during adolescence. Implications for the assessment of intelligence are discussed.

The partially nitrated impurities present in ETN were studied using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to address the ultimate challenge in forensic explosives investigations, i.e., providing chemical and tactical information on the production and origin of the explosive material found at a crime scene. Accurate quantification of the tri-nitrated byproduct erythritol trinitrate (ETriN) was achieved by in-lab production of an ETriN standard and using custom-made standards of the two isomers of ETriN (1,2,3-ETriN and 1,2,4-ETriN). Large differences in levels of ETriN were observed between the two sample sets showing that, even when similar synthesis routes are employed, batches from different production locations can contain different impurity profiles. In one of the sample sets the ratios of the lesser partially nitrated impurities, EDiN and EMN, in the ETN samples could be determined. The impurity profiles enable prediction of post-synthesis work-up steps by reduction of the level of partially nitrated products upon recrystallization. However, impurity analysis does not enable predictions with respect to raw material or synthesis route used. Nonetheless, characteristic impurity profiles obtained can be used in forensic casework to differentiate or link ETN samples. However, forensic interpretation can be complicated by acid catalyzed degradation which can cause changes in impurity levels over time. The high food-grade quality of the erythritol precursor materials did not provide other impurity markers using the LC-MS methods in this study. To expand our framework of chemical attribution a follow-up study will be reported that focuses on stable isotope analysis of ETN and its precursor materials that potentially allow predictions for forensic explosives intelligence.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) proves to have enormous potential in many areas of healthcare including research and chemical discoveries. Using large amounts of aggregated data, the AI can discover and learn further transforming these data into \"usable\" knowledge. Being well aware of this, the world's leading pharmaceutical companies have already begun to use artificial intelligence to improve their research regarding new drugs. The goal is to exploit modern computational biology and machine learning systems to predict the molecular behaviour and the likelihood of getting a useful drug, thus saving time and money on unnecessary tests. Clinical studies, electronic medical records, high-resolution medical images, and genomic profiles can be used as resources to aid drug development. Pharmaceutical and medical researchers have extensive data sets that can be analyzed by strong AI systems. This review focused on how computational biology and artificial intelligence technologies can be implemented by integrating the knowledge of cancer drugs, drug resistance, next-generation sequencing, genetic variants, and structural biology in the cancer precision drug discovery.", "Recent lead (Pb) exposure reduction strategies enabled to lower children's blood lead levels (B-Pb) worldwide. This study reports the estimated intelligence gain and social cost savings attributable to recent exposure reduction based on reported B-Pb levels observed in adolescents sampled within the framework of the Flemish Environment and Health Studies (FLEHS, Belgium), i.e. in 2003-2004 (FLEHSI), in 2008-2009 (FLEHSII), and in 2013-2014 (FLEHSIII).\nIntelligence Quotient (IQ) loss per 100,000 individuals - attributable to B-Pb above 20\u2009\u03bcg/L - was estimated based on widely accepted dose response functions between children's B-Pb and IQ (-\u20091.88 IQ points for a duplication in B-Pb from 20\u2009\u03bcg/L onwards; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -\u20091.16;-2.59) and B-Pb exposure distribution parameters of FLEHS studies. The results were translated to the Flemish population of 15-year-olds. Given a 3-year time gap between subsequent sampling periods, the exposure distribution of each study was assumed 3 years prior to the study as well. Economic impact was estimated based on expected decrease in lifetime earnings (\u20ac 19,464 per decreasing IQ point in 2018).\nThe percentage of the adolescent population exceeding a B-Pb of 20\u2009\u03bcg/L decreased from 57% (FLEHSI) to 23% (FLEHSII), and even further to 2.5% (FLEHSIII). The estimated IQ loss per 100,000 individuals was 94,280 (95% CI: 58,427-130,138) in FLEHSI, 14,993 (95% CI: 9289-20,695) in FLEHSII, and 976 (95% CI: 604-1347) in FLEHSIII. This translates into a total loss of 378,962 (95%CI: 234,840-523,091) IQ points within the Flemish population of 15-year-olds between 2000 and 2014. Assuming that current exposure levels do not reincrease, the expected IQ loss during the subsequent period of 15\u2009years is estimated to be maximally 10,275 (95%CI: 6363-14,182) points.\n7176 (95%CI: 4447-9905) million \u20ac of social cost savings were achieved by Pb reduction strategies in Flanders over 15\u2009years. If current exposure levels further reduce to B-Pb below 20\u2009\u03bcg/L for the whole population, social cost savings may increase up to 7376 (95%CI: 4571-10,181) million \u20ac. Given the relatively low lead contamination in Flanders, the global impact of ongoing reduction strategies is expected to be tremendous.", "Several studies have demonstrated that individual differences in processing speed fully mediate the association between age and intelligence, whereas the association between processing speed and intelligence cannot be explained by age differences. Because measures of processing speed reflect a plethora of cognitive and motivational processes, it cannot be determined which specific processes give rise to this mediation effect. This makes it hard to decide whether these processes should be conceived of as a cause or an indicator of cognitive aging. In the present study, we addressed this question by using a neurocognitive psychometrics approach to decompose the association between age differences and fluid intelligence. Reanalyzing data from two previously published datasets containing 223 participants between 18 and 61 years, we investigated whether individual differences in diffusion model parameters and in ERP latencies associated with higher-order attentional processing explained the association between age differences and fluid intelligence. We demonstrate that individual differences in the speed of non-decisional processes such as encoding, response preparation, and response execution, and individual differences in latencies of ERP components associated with higher-order cognitive processes explained the negative association between age differences and fluid intelligence. Because both parameters jointly accounted for the association between age differences and fluid intelligence, age-related differences in both parameters may reflect age-related differences in anterior brain regions associated with response planning that are prone to be affected by age-related changes. Conversely, age differences did not account for the association between processing speed and fluid intelligence. Our results suggest that the relationship between age differences and fluid intelligence is multifactorially determined.", "Central theories of cognitive aging propose that education is an important protective factor for decline in cognitive performance in older age. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reported estimates of an association between educational attainment and change in performance in six cognitive domains (episodic memory, processing speed, verbal fluency, crystallized intelligence, fluid intelligence, and global ability) in the general population of older individuals. The systematic search (11th of October 2019) identified 92 eligible articles. The episodic memory domain had the highest number of estimates (37 estimates from 18 articles, n = 109,281) included in the meta-analysis. The fewest estimates (6 estimates from 6 articles, n = 5263) were included for fluid intelligence. Pooled mean estimates from an inverse-variance weighted random effects analysis were not statistically significant and indicated that any association between education and change in cognitive performance is likely of a negligible magnitude. The estimates for education's role (one additional year) for change in cognitive performance ranged from -0.019 (95 % confidence interval, CI = -0.047, 0.010) to 0.004SD (CI = -0.003, 0.012) per decade. Even if the larger positive point estimates (i.e., protective effects) are selectively considered, the influence of education on change is still at least 12 times less important for the cognitive functioning of an older individual than the association between education and level of cognitive performance. Sensitivity analyses did not substantially alter these results. However, heterogeneity was substantial, and remained largely unexplained by mean age, mean educational attainment, Gini coefficient, GDP per capita, maximum follow-up period, and publication year. Overall, education is an important factor in aging due to its robust association with level of performance, but the current base of empirical evidence is not revealing a consistent and substantial association between educational attainment and changes in cognitive performance in the general population. Theories of cognitive aging must be updated to incorporate this pattern of findings.", "The synthesis of organic compounds, which is central to many areas such as drug discovery, material synthesis and biomolecular chemistry, requires chemists to have years of knowledge and experience. The development of technologies with the potential to learn and support experts in the design of synthetic routes is a half-century-old challenge with an interesting revival in the last decade. In fact, the renewed interest in artificial intelligence (AI), driven mainly by data availability, is profoundly changing the landscape of computer-aided chemical reaction prediction and retrosynthetic analysis. In this article, we briefly review different approaches to predict forward reactions and retrosynthesis, with a strong focus on data-driven ones. While data-driven technologies still need to demonstrate their full potential compared to expert rule-based systems in synthetic chemistry, the acceleration experienced in the last decade is a convincing sign that where we use software today, there will be AI tomorrow. This revolution will help and empower bench chemists, driving the transformation of chemistry towards a high-tech business over the next decades.", "(1) Background: Recently, it has been shown that the extent of resection (EOR) and molecular classification of low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are endowed with prognostic significance. However, a prognostic stratification of patients able to give specific weight to the single parameters able to predict prognosis is still missing. Here, we adopt classic statistics and an artificial intelligence algorithm to define a multiparametric prognostic stratification of grade II glioma patients. (2) Methods: 241 adults who underwent surgery for a supratentorial LGG were included. Clinical, neuroradiological, surgical, histopathological and molecular data were assessed for their ability to predict overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and malignant progression-free survival (MPFS). Finally, a decision-tree algorithm was employed to stratify patients. (3) Results: Classic statistics confirmed EOR, pre-operative- and post-operative tumor volumes, Ki67, and the molecular classification as independent predictors of OS, PFS, and MPFS. The decision tree approach provided an algorithm capable of identifying prognostic factors and defining both the cut-off levels and the hierarchy to be used in order to delineate specific prognostic classes with high positive predictive value. Key results were the superior role of EOR on that of molecular class, the importance of second surgery, and the role of different prognostic factors within the three molecular classes. (4) Conclusions: This study proposes a stratification of LGG patients based on the different combinations of clinical, molecular, and imaging data, adopting a supervised non-parametric learning method. If validated in independent case studies, the clinical utility of this innovative stratification approach might be proved.", "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) usually associated with a CGG expansion, termed full mutation (FM: CGG \u2265 200), increased DNA methylation of the FMR1 promoter and silencing of the gene. Mosaicism for presence of cells with either methylated FM or smaller unmethylated pre-mutation (PM: CGG 55-199) alleles in the same individual have been associated with better cognitive functioning. This study compares age- and sex-matched FM-only and PM/FM mosaic individuals on intellectual functioning, ASD features and maladaptive behaviours.\nThis study comprised a large international cohort of 126 male and female participants with FXS (aged 1.15 to 43.17\u2009years) separated into FM-only and PM/FM mosaic groups (90 males, 77.8% FM-only; 36 females, 77.8% FM-only). Intellectual functioning was assessed with age appropriate developmental or intelligence tests. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition was used to examine ASD features while the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community assessed maladaptive behaviours.\nComparing males and females (FM-only + PM/FM mosaic), males had poorer intellectual functioning on all domains (p < 0.0001). Although females had less ASD features and less parent-reported maladaptive behaviours, these differences were no longer significant after controlling for intellectual functioning. Participants with PM/FM mosaicism, regardless of sex, presented with better intellectual functioning and less maladaptive behaviours compared with their age- and sex-matched FM-only counterparts (p < 0.05). ASD features were similar between FM-only and PM/FM mosaics within each sex, after controlling for overall intellectual functioning.\nMales with FXS had significantly lower intellectual functioning than females with FXS. However, there were no significant differences in ASD features and maladaptive behaviours, after controlling for intellectual functioning, independent of the presence or absence of mosaicism. This suggests that interventions that primarily target cognitive abilities may in turn reduce the severity of maladaptive behaviours including ASD features in FXS.", "Object recognition, which can be used in processes such as reconstruction of the environment map or the intelligent navigation of vehicles, is a necessary task in smart city environments. In this paper, we propose an architecture that integrates heterogeneously distributed information to recognize objects in intelligent environments. The architecture is based on the IoT/Industry 4.0 model to interconnect the devices, which are called smart resources. smart resources can process local sensor data and offer information to other devices as a service. These other devices can be located in the same operating range (the edge), in the same intranet (the fog), or on the Internet (the cloud). smart resources must have an intelligent layer in order to be able to process the information. A system with two smart resources equipped with different image sensors is implemented to validate the architecture. Our experiments show that the integration of information increases the certainty in the recognition of objects by 2-4%. Consequently, in intelligent environments, it seems appropriate to provide the devices with not only intelligence, but also capabilities to collaborate closely with other devices.", "Bruxism is a masticatory muscle activity characterized by high prevalence, widespread complications, and serious consequences but without specific guidelines for its diagnosis and treatment. Although occlusal force-based biofeedback therapy is proven to be safe, effective, and with few side effects in improving bruxism, its mechanism and key technologies remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to research a real-time, quantitative, intelligent, and precise force-based biofeedback detection device based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the diagnosis and treatment of bruxism. Stress sensors were integrated and embedded into a resin-based occlusion stabilization splint by using a layering technique (sandwich method). The sensor system mainly consisted of a pressure signal acquisition module, a main control module, and a server terminal. A machine learning algorithm was leveraged for occlusal force data processing and parameter configuration. This study implemented a sensor prototype system from scratch to fully evaluate each component of the intelligent splint. Experiment results showed reasonable parameter metrics for the sensors system and demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed scheme for bruxism treatment. The intelligent occlusion stabilization splint with a stress sensor system is a promising approach to bruxism diagnosis and treatment.", "While IQ is weakly related to the overall face recognition (Shakeshaft & Plomin, 2015), it plays a larger role in the processing of misaligned faces in the composite face task (Zhu et al., 2010). This type of stimuli are relatively novel and may reflect the involvement of intelligence in the processing of infrequently encountered faces, such as those of other-ethnicities. Extraversion is associated with increased eye contact which signifies less viewing of diagnostic features for Black faces. Using an old/new recognition paradigm, we found that IQ negatively correlated with the magnitude of the own-ethnicity bias (OEB) and that this relationship was moderated by contact with people from another ethnicity. We interpret these results in terms of IQ enhancing the ability to process novel stimuli by utilising multiple forms of coding. Extraversion was positively correlated with the OEB in White participants and negatively correlated with the OEB in Black participants suggesting that extraverts have lower attention to diagnostic facial features of Black faces, leading to poorer recognition of Black faces in both White and Black participants, thereby contributing to the relative OEB in these participants. The OEB is dependent on participant variables such as intelligence and extraversion.", "This Personal View is based on our experiences with the levels of integration. We are concerned about the (mis) interpretation of 'integration ladder' in our context and propose directions for rethinking curriculum integration. We share the famous board game 'Ludo' as a metaphor to understand the concept of integration. Mughal emperors (educators) played (lead) Ludo (curriculum/teaching reforms) in which tokens (disciplines) move from their silos (departments) towards others (integrate) according to rolls of a dice (resources) and not stepwise (1-2-3\u202611) like in a ladder. There are safe spaces (timetable/minimum hours), double pieces (combination of different integration levels) and tokens (disciplines) can also be pushed back to their silos by opponents (challenges). The game (change management) involves skill (competence in medical education), strategy (planning), emotion (emotional intelligence) and luck. We found Ludo relevant to understanding integration and discuss three different systems with implications on the curriculum, assessment, organisational structure and timetable/schedules. We believe that a clear description of integration as three different systems will counter the issues with the integration ladder and make it easier for institutions and educationists to understand, opt for and implement curriculum integration.", "Objective: To investigate the diagnosis of normal cornea, subclinical keratoconus and keratoconus by artifical intelligence. Methods: Diagnostic study. From January 2016 to January 2019, who admitted to Tianjin Eye Hospital from 18 to 48 years old, with an average of (28.4\u00b18.2) years of myopia patients in 2 018 cases. Two experienced ophthalmologists labeled keratoconus, subclinical keratconus and nomal cornea based on the topography. The data of 80% (1 615 cases) patients were randomly selected as the training set by computer random sampling method, and the data of 20% (403 cases) patients were used as the verification set. Using the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm to extract 28 corneal parameters, and establish an algorithm model to diagnose the corneal condition of the patient, verify the diagnostic accuracy of the model by using the 10-fold cross-validation method, and evaluate the model using the receiver operating characteristic curve. Sensitivity and specificity with the original labeling and ophthalmic resident labeling. Results: The diagnostic accuracy of the model was 95.53%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the validation set was 0.996 6. The accuracy of the model for diagnosis of subclinical keratoconus and normal cornea was 96.67%, the AUC of the validation set was 0.993 6; the accuracy of diagnosis of keratoconus and normal cornea was 98.91%, and the AUC of the validation set was 0.998 2. The diagnostic accuracy of the model is 95.53%, which is significantly better than the resident's 93.55%. Conclusion: The model established by artifical intelligence can diagnose the subclinical keratoconus with high accuracy, which can greatly improve the clinical diagnosis efficiency and accuracy of young and primary ophthalmologists.

Among the sectors where AI/ML enables a plethora of opportunities, industrial manufacturing can expect significant gains from the increased process automation. At the same time, the introduction of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), providing improved wireless connectivity for real-time manufacturing data collection and processing, has resulted in the culmination of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. In this survey, we focus on the vital processes of fault detection, prediction and prevention in Industry 4.0 and present recent developments in ML-based solutions. We start by examining various proposed cloud/fog/edge architectures, highlighting their importance for acquiring manufacturing data in order to train the ML algorithms. In addition, as faults might also occur from sources beyond machine degradation, the potential of ML in safeguarding cyber-security is thoroughly discussed. Moreover, a major concern in the Industry 4.0 ecosystem is the role of human operators and workers. Towards this end, a detailed overview of ML-based human-machine interaction techniques is provided, allowing humans to be in-the-loop of the manufacturing processes in a symbiotic manner with minimal errors. Finally, open issues in these relevant fields are given, stimulating further research.", "Many illnesses have been attributed to the exposure of solid biomass smoke but the effect on intelligence has largely been unexplored. The study aims to examine the effect of exposure to solid biomass smoke during the first 3\u00a0years of life on intelligence among 6-8-year-old children. Children aged 6-8\u00a0years were enrolled from a primary school and their houses were visited to collect data on socio-economic status and household exposure assessment. Households using LPG as cooking fuel were considered as the unexposed group. All the children were tested for their Intelligence Quotient (IQ) using Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC). The mean IQ was calculated as the average of Verbal and Performance score. Potential confounders were adjusted using multivariate general linear model. About 45% of children had average or above-average IQ while the rest had below-average IQ. The mean scores for the arithmetic component of IQ were found to be significantly lower among solid biomass fuel users as compared to LPG users after adjusting for confounders. The mean IQ of LPG users were 5.58 points higher (95% CI: 0.46-10.1) for the arithmetic component as compared to solid biomass users. Children living in the houses using solid biomass fuel for cooking have lower IQ as compared to the children living in the houses using LPG for cooking for arithmetic component even after adjusting for potential confounders.", "The concepts of Fourier optics were established in France in the 1940s by Pierre-Michel Duffieux, and laid the foundations of an extensive series of activities in the French research community that have touched on nearly every aspect of contemporary optics and photonics. In this paper, we review a selection of results where applications of the Fourier transform and transfer functions in optics have been applied to yield significant advances in unexpected areas of optics, including the spatial shaping of complex laser beams in amplitude and in phase, real-time ultrafast measurements, novel ghost imaging techniques, and the development of parallel processing methodologies for photonic artificial intelligence.", "Emerging evidence suggests potential positive neuropsychological effects of periconceptional folate in both healthy children and children exposed in utero to antiseizure medications (ASMs). In this report, we test the hypothesis that periconceptional folate improves neurodevelopment in children of women with epilepsy by re-examining data from the Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (NEAD) study.\nThe NEAD study was an NIH-funded, prospective, observational, multicenter investigation of pregnancy outcomes in 311 children of 305 women with epilepsy treated with ASM monotherapy. Missing data points were imputed with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Multivariate analyses adjusted for multiple factors (e.g., maternal IQ, ASM type, standardized ASM dose, and gestational birth age) were performed to assess the effects of periconceptional folate on cognitive outcomes (i.e., Full Scale Intelligence Quotient [FSIQ], Verbal and Nonverbal indexes, and Expressive and Receptive Language indexes at 3 and 6 years of age, and executive function and memory function at 6 years of age).\nPericonceptional folate was associated with higher FSIQ at both 3 and 6 years of age. Significant effects for other measures included Nonverbal Index, Expressive Language Index, and Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment Executive Function at 6 years of age, and Verbal Index and Receptive Language Index at 3 years of age. Nonsignificant effects included Verbal Index, Receptive Index, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Parent Questionnaire Executive Function, and General Memory Index at 6 years of age, and Nonverbal Index and Expressive Index at 3 years of age.\nUse of periconceptional folate in pregnant women with epilepsy taking ASMs is associated with better cognitive development.\nNCT00021866.", "The consistency of drug quality is related to the clinical efficacy and safety,which is highly valued by the government and relevant industries. Compared with chemical medicine,traditional Chinese medicine originates from the nature,and is greatly influenced by natural factors,such as the place of origin,cultivation and processing technology,climate. The quality consistency of traditional Chinese medicine is poor. The quality consistency has become the pain point and difficulty of the development of the traditional Chinese medicine industry,which seriously affects the stability and controllability of clinical efficacy and the reproducibility or recognition of modern research results. It is also a bottleneck for Chinese patent medicine to enter the international market. Mixed batch blending technology is an effective method for the scientific guarantee of the quality consistency in other industries and disciplines,and widely applied in liquor making industry,tobacco industry and perfume industry. Overseas,mixed batch blending technology has been successfully applied in guaranteeing the quality consistency of Ginkgo biloba preparations Jinnado. It has been used in the production of Chinese formulations in Japan for more than 30 years. In recent years,mixed batch blending technology has been introduced into the pharmaceutical field to ensure the quality consistency of traditional Chinese medicine,and relevant research has gradually increased.This manuscript reviews the application of blending technology in other disciplines,summarizes the algorithm principles and software systems of mixed batch blending in traditional Chinese medicine or natural medicine,explains the specific implementation process of mixed batch blending technology,and looks forward to the application prospects of artificial intelligence and other new technologies,in the hope of providing new ideas and technologies for breaking through the problem of quality consistency,and boosting the high-quality and high-level development of Chinese medicine industry in the new era.", "Digital innovations have led to an explosion of data in healthcare, driving processes of democratization and foreshadowing the end of the paternalistic era of medicine and the inception of a new epoch characterized by patient-centered care. We illustrate that the \"do it yourself\" (DIY) automated insulin delivery (AID) innovation of diabetes is a leading example of democratization of medicine as evidenced by its application to the three pillars of democratization in healthcare (intelligent computing; sharing of information; and privacy, security, and safety) outlined by Stanford but also within a broader context of democratization. The heuristic algorithms integral to DIY AID have been developed and refined by human intelligence and demonstrate intelligent computing. We deliver examples of research in artificial pancreas technology which actively pursues the use of machine learning representative of artificial intelligence (AI) and also explore alternate approaches to AI within the DIY AID example. Sharing of information symbolizes the core philosophy behind the success of the DIY AID evolution. We examine data sharing for algorithm development and refinement, for sharing of the open-source algorithm codes online, for peer to peer support, and sharing with medical and scientific communities. Do it yourself AID systems have no regulatory approval raising safety concerns as well as medico-legal and ethical implications for healthcare professionals. Other privacy and security factors are also discussed. Democratization of healthcare promises better health access for all and we recognize the limitations of DIY AID as it exists presently, however, we believe it has great potential.", "Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is common, and features a widened Sharp's angle as observed on pelvic x-ray images. Determination of Sharp's angle, essential for clinical decisions, can overwhelm the workload of orthopedic surgeons. To aid diagnosis of DDH and reduce false negative diagnoses, a simple and cost-effective tool is proposed. The model was designed using artificial intelligence (AI), and evaluated for its ability to screen anteroposterior pelvic radiographs automatically, accurately, and efficiently.Orthotopic anterior pelvic x-ray images were retrospectively collected (n = 11574) from the PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) database at Second Hospital of Jilin University. The Mask regional convolutional neural network (R-CNN) model was utilized and finely modified to detect 4 key points that delineate Sharp's angle. Of these images, 11,473 were randomly selected, labeled, and used to train and validate the modified Mask R-CNN model. A test dataset comprised the remaining 101 images. Python-based utility software was applied to draw and calculate Sharp's angle automatically. The diagnoses of DDH obtained via the model or the traditional manual drawings of 3 orthopedic surgeons were compared, each based on the degree of Sharp's angle, and these were then evaluated relative to the final clinical diagnoses (based on medical history, symptoms, signs, x-ray films, and computed tomography images).Sharp's angles on the left and right measured via the AI model (40.07\u00b0\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.09\u00b0 and 40.65\u00b0\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.21\u00b0), were statistically similar to that of the surgeons' (39.35\u00b0\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.74\u00b0 and 39.82\u00b0\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.99\u00b0). The measurement time required by the AI model (1.11\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.00\u200as) was significantly less than that of the doctors (86.72\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.10, 93.26\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.12, and 87.34\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.80\u200as). The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the AI method for diagnosis of DDH were similar to that of the orthopedic surgeons; the diagnoses of both were moderately consistent with the final clinical diagnosis.The proposed AI model can automatically measure Sharp's angle with a performance similar to that of orthopedic surgeons, but requires far less time. The AI model may be a viable auxiliary to clinical diagnosis of DDH.", "Cognitive impairment is a frequent and serious problem in patients with various forms of severe mental illnesses (SMI), including schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP). Recent research suggests genetic links to several cognitive phenotypes in both SMI and in the general population. Our goal in this study was to identify potential genomic signatures of cognitive functioning in veterans with severe mental illness and compare them to previous findings for cognition across different populations. Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) Study #572 evaluated cognitive and functional capacity measures among SZ and BP patients. In conjunction with the VA Million Veteran Program, 3,959 European American (1,095 SZ, 2,864 BP) and 2,601 African American (1,095 SZ, 2,864 BP) patients were genotyped using a custom Affymetrix Axiom Biobank array. We performed a genome-wide association study of global cognitive functioning, constructed polygenic scores for SZ and cognition in the general population, and examined genetic correlations with 2,626 UK Biobank traits. Although no single locus attained genome-wide significance, observed allelic effects were strongly consistent with previous studies. We observed robust associations between global cognitive functioning and polygenic scores for cognitive performance, intelligence, and SZ risk. We also identified significant genetic correlations with several cognition-related traits in UK Biobank. In a diverse cohort of U.S. veterans with SZ or BP, we demonstrate broad overlap of common genetic effects on cognition in the general population, and find that greater polygenic loading for SZ risk is associated with poorer cognitive performance.", "Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression is a method commonly used in environmental epidemiology to assess the impact of chemical mixtures in relation to a health outcome of interest. Data are partitioned into a single training and test set to reduce sample-specific chemical weights. However, in typical epidemiology sample sizes, this may produce unstable chemical weights and WQS index estimates, and investigators may resort to training and testing on the same data. To solve this problem, we propose repeated holdout validation whereby data are randomly partitioned 100 times, producing a distribution of validated results. Taking the mean as the final estimate, confidence estimates may also be calculated for inference. Further, this method helps characterize the variability in chemical weights, aiding in the identification of chemicals of concern. This is important since it may direct future research into specific chemicals. Using data from 718 mother-child pairs in the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and Child, Asthma and Allergy (SELMA) study, we assessed the association between prenatal exposure to 26 endocrine disrupting chemicals and child Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Results using a single partition were unstable, varying by random seed. The WQS index estimate was significant when all data was used (e.g. no partition) (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f-2.2 CI\u202f=\u202f-3.43, -0.98), but attenuated and nonsignificant using repeated holdout validation (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.82 CI\u202f=\u202f-2.11, 0.45). When implementing WQS in epidemiologic studies with limited sample sizes, repeated holdout validation is a viable alternative to using a single, or no partitioning. Repeated holdout can both stabilize results and help characterize the uncertainty in identifying chemicals of concern, while maintaining some of the the rigor of holdout validation. \u2022Repeated holdout validation improves the stability of WQS estimates in finite study samples\u2022Uncertainty in identifying toxic chemicals of concern is acknowledged and characterized.", "Estimated at 2.6 million annually, stillbirths worldwide have stayed alarmingly high, in contrast to neonatal and under-five mortality rates. It is a neglected public health challenge globally, with less attention to its social determinants. We examined spatial patterns of country-level stillbirth rates and determined the influence of social determinants of health on spatial patterns of stillbirth rates. We also estimated probabilistic relationships between stillbirth rates and significant determinants from the spatial analysis. Using country-level aggregated data from the United Nations databases, it employed ecological spatial analysis and artificial intelligence modeling based on Bayesian network among 194 World Health Organization member countries. From the spatial analysis, thirty-seven countries formed a cluster of high values (hot-spots) for stillbirth and 13 countries formed a cluster of low values (cold-spots). In the multivariate regression, gender inequality and anaemia in pregnancy were significantly associated with spatial patterns of higher stillbirth rates, while higher antenatal care (ANC) coverage and skilled birth attendants during delivery were associated with clusters of lower stillbirth rates. The Bayesian network model suggests strong dependencies between stillbirth rate and gender inequality index, geographic regions and skilled birth attendants during delivery. The Bayesian network predicted that the probability of low stillbirth rate increased from 56% to 100% when the percentage of countries with high skilled birth attendants during delivery increased from 70% to 88%, high ANC coverage increased from 55% to 70%, high prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy decreased from 27% to 11% and high gender inequality index decreased from 43% to 21%. Recognizing the urgency in reducing stillbirths globally, multi-pronged strategies should be designed to promote gender equality and strengthen the reproductive and maternal health services in Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, South Eastern Asia, and other countries with disproportionately high stillbirth rates.", "Man and technology seem to co-evolve into a process of reciprocal conditioning. On the one hand, the man modifies (and evolves) the technology according to his needs, on the other the technology revolutionates the man and the way in which it lives. Psychology, therefore, as a discipline afferent to the human sciences, is called to take an interest in this relationship and to understand its complexity. A fundamental role in this sense is covered by \"cyberpsychology\" which investigates all those psychological phenomena that are associated with technology and aims to analyse the processes of change triggered by the interaction between man and the new media. From the psychological point of view, if on the one hand it is important to understand how man changes in contact with the new technologies and to what problems he is meeting. On the other hand, there is a need to understand how new technologies, given their transformative potential, can find a place within the therapeutic practice. In this regard, some of the technologies used in the clinical field have been analysed including: virtual reality, biosensors, artificial intelligence and affective computing. With the aim of understanding to what extent and how technological progress and the emergence of new technologies can contribute and generate value within the psychological panorama. Following the PRISMA statement a bibliographic research was carried out, which provided for consultation of the Medline and PsycINFO databases. The criteria according to which works have been selected rather than others refer to their precision and sensitivity with which they propose to treat technological applications in the field of health psychology and from this the emergence of the new theme \"CYBER HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY\". The results of the research suggest that the integrated use of psychological techniques and new technologies is extremely productive in terms of potential improvement of health and therefore of \"health empowerment\". In this vision, new technologies are not intended to replace traditional procedures but to integrate them by making available features and potential that man does not have in nature. Given the great potential of the instruments analyzed that still today continue to evolve and refine it is advisable to know them, validate their effectiveness and adapt our operational models to new realities.", "The urban heat island is a vastly documented climatological phenomenon, but when it comes to coastal cities, close to desert areas, its analysis becomes extremely challenging, given the high temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity. The strong dependency on the synoptic weather conditions, rather than on city-specific, constant features, hinders the identification of recurrent patterns, leading conventional predicting algorithms to fail. In this paper, an advanced artificial intelligence technique based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model is applied to gain insight and predict the highly fluctuating heat island intensity (UHII) in the city of Sydney, Australia, governed by the dualistic system of cool sea breeze from the ocean and hot western winds from the vast desert biome inlands. Hourly measurements of temperature, collected for a period of 18\u00a0years (1999-2017) from 8 different sites in a 50\u00a0km radius from the coastline, were used to train (80%) and test (20%) the model. Other inputs included date, time, and previously computed UHII, feedbacked to the model with an optimized time step of six hours. A second set of models integrated wind speed at the reference station to account for the sea breeze effect. The R2 ranged between 0.770 and 0.932 for the training dataset and between 0.841 and 0.924 for the testing dataset, with the best performance attained right in correspondence of the city hot spots. Unexpectedly, very little benefit (0.06-0.43%) was achieved by including the sea breeze among the input variables. Overall, this study is insightful of a rather rare climatological case at the watershed between maritime and desertic typicality. We proved that accurate UHII predictions can be achieved by learning from long-term air temperature records, provided that an appropriate predicting architecture is utilized.", "Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to improve diagnosis and prognostication for acute and chronic kidney diseases. Studies published in 2019 relied on a variety of available data sources towards this objective, including electronic health records, intraoperative physiological signals, kidney ultrasound imaging, and digitized biopsy specimens.", "Group B streptococcus (GBS) is an important pathogen that is responsible for invasive infections, including sepsis and meningitis. GBS serotyping is an essential means for the investigation of possible infection outbreaks and can identify possible sources of infection. Although it is possible to determine GBS serotypes by either immuno-serotyping or geno-serotyping, both traditional methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been reported as an effective tool for the determination of GBS serotypes in a more rapid and accurate manner. Thus, this work aims to investigate GBS serotypes by incorporating machine learning techniques with MALDI-TOF MS to carry out the identification.\nIn this study, a total of 787 GBS isolates, obtained from three research and teaching hospitals, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, and the serotype of the GBS was determined by a geno-serotyping experiment. The peaks of mass-to-charge ratios were regarded as the attributes to characterize the various serotypes of GBS. Machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), were then used to construct predictive models for the five different serotypes (Types Ia, Ib, III, V, and VI). After optimization of feature selection and model generation based on training datasets, the accuracies of the selected models attained 54.9-87.1% for various serotypes based on independent testing data. Specifically, for the major serotypes, namely type III and type VI, the accuracies were 73.9 and 70.4%, respectively.\nThe proposed models have been adopted to implement a web-based tool (GBSTyper), which is now freely accessible at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/GBSTyper/, for providing efficient and effective detection of GBS serotypes based on a MALDI-TOF MS spectrum. Overall, this work has demonstrated that the combination of MALDI-TOF MS and machine intelligence could provide a practical means of clinical pathogen testing.", "The high penetration level of renewable energy is thought to be one of the basic characteristics of future smart grids. Wind power, as one of the most increasing renewable energy, has brought a large number of uncertainties into the power systems. These uncertainties would require system operators to change their traditional ways of decision-making. This article provides a comprehensive survey of computational intelligence techniques for wind power uncertainty quantification in smart grids. First, prediction intervals (PIs) are introduced as a means to quantify the uncertainties in wind power forecasts. Various PI evaluation indices, including the latest trends in comprehensive evaluation techniques, are compared. Furthermore, computational intelligence-based PI construction methods are summarized and classified into traditional methods (parametric) and direct PI construction methods (nonparametric). In the second part of this article, methods of incorporating wind power forecast uncertainties into power system decision-making processes are investigated. Three techniques, namely, stochastic models, fuzzy logic models, and robust optimization, and different power system applications using these techniques are reviewed. Finally, future research directions, such as spatiotemporal and hierarchical forecasting, deep learning-based methods, and integration of predictive uncertainty estimates into the decision-making process, are discussed.

In particular, impaired working memory performance has been found in CHD patients of all ages. Working memory is an important domain of higher order cognitive function and is crucial for everyday activities, with emerging importance in adolescence. However, the underlying neural correlate of working memory impairments in CHD is not yet fully understood. Diffusion tensor imaging and tract based spatial statistics analyses were conducted in 47 adolescent survivors of childhood cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (24 females) and in 44 healthy controls (24 females) between 11 and 16 years of age (mean age\u00a0=\u00a013.9, SD\u00a0=\u00a01.6). Fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter diffusion was compared between groups and was correlated with working memory performance, derived from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. CHD patients had significantly poorer working memory compared to controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Widespread bilateral reduction in FA was observed in CHD patients compared to healthy controls (threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) corrected p < 0.05). This reduction in FA was present both in cyanotic and acyanotic CHD patients compared to healthy controls (both p < 0.001). The FA reduction in the frontal lobe, mainly in the forceps minor, was associated with poorer working memory performance in both patients with CHD and healthy controls (TFCE corrected p < 0.05). The current findings underline that in CHD patients, irrespective of disease severity, disrupted or delayed maturation of white matter may persist into adolescence and is associated with working memory impairments, particularly if present in the frontal lobe. Adolescence, which is a crucial period for prefrontal brain maturation, may offer a window of opportunity for intervention in order to support the maturation of frontal brain regions and therefore improve higher order cognitive function in patients with CHD.", "Design (DF) and phonemic fluency tests (FAS; D-KEFS, 2001) are commonly used to investigate voluntary generation. Despite this, several important issues remain poorly investigated. In a sizeable sample of patients with focal left or right frontal lesion we established that voluntary generation performance cannot be accounted for by fluid intelligence. For DF we found patients performed significantly worse than healthy controls (HC) only on the switch condition. However, no significant difference between left and right frontal patients was found. In contrast, left frontal patients were significantly impaired when compared with HC and right frontal patients on FAS. These lateralization findings were complemented, for the first time, by three neuroimaging; investigations. A traditional frontal subgrouping method found significant differences on FAS between patients with or without Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus lesions involving BA 44 and/or 45. Parcel Based Lesion Symptom Mapping (PLSM) found lower scores on FAS were significantly associated with damage to posterior Left Middle Frontal Gyrus. An increase in rule break errors, so far only anecdotally reported, was associated with damage to the left dorsal anterior cingulate and left body of the corpus callosum, supporting the idea that conflict resolution and monitoring impairments may play a role. Tractwise statistical analysis (TSA) revealed that patients with disconnection; in the left anterior thalamic projections, frontal aslant tract, frontal; orbitopolar tract, pons, superior longitudinal fasciculus I and II performed significantly worse than patients without disconnection in these tracts on FAS. In contrast, PLSM and TSA analyses did not reveal any significant relationship between lesion location and performance on the DF switch condition. Overall, these findings suggest DF may have limited utility as a tool in detecting lateralized frontal executive dysfunction, whereas FAS and rule break behavior appears to be linked to a set of well localized left frontal grey matter regions and white matter tracts.", "At present,the production equipment and process of Chinese patent medicines still have many problems including high energy consumption,low efficiency,high pollution,and low intelligence,which seriously hinder the transformation,upgrading and modernized development of traditional Chinese medicine industry. With the emergence of various new pharmaceutical technologies and the application of technologies of other fields in traditional Chinese medicine industry,the development of Chinese patent medicine has ushered in new opportunities. The processes such as pulverization,mixing,extraction,separation,concentration,drying and sterilization are unique for the production of Chinese patent medicine. These main features can be distinguished from the manufacturing process of chemical drugs,determining the characteristics of the production process and equipment of Chinese patent medicine. In this paper,each operation unit was mentioned to summarize and analyze the new equipment and new technologies with advantages and characteristics in recent years from the perspectives of definition,principle,classification and application. Among them,the automatic spray device of the mixer,the extraction and separation equipment of volatile oil,and the crane basket-type circulation extraction technology,composite multi-layer spiral vibration countercurrent drying,and vibration sterilization equipment all have rapid development in recent years,with great prospects in the production of Chinese patent medicines. In this paper,we also analyzed some problems existing in the production equipment and technology of Chinese patent medicine and the key factors restricting the development of Chinese patent medicine,discussed the transformation of Chinese patent medicine production from traditional to modern and from semi-automatic to intelligent,and put forward three suggestions to help Chinese patent medicine achieve the goal of improving quality,efficiency and green manufacturing in production.", "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a bio-plausible and potentially power-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning. Although there has been progress towards implementing SNN functionalities in custom CMOS-based hardware using beyond Von Neumann architectures, the power-efficiency of the human brain has remained elusive. This has necessitated investigations of novel material systems which can efficiently mimic the functional units of SNNs, such as neurons and synapses. In this paper, we present a magnetoelectric-magnetic tunnel junction (ME-MTJ) device as a synapse. We arrange these synapses in a crossbar fashion and perform in situ unsupervised learning. We leverage the capacitive nature of write-ports in ME-MTJs, wherein by applying appropriately shaped voltage pulses across the write-port, the ME-MTJ can be switched in a probabilistic manner. We further exploit the sigmoidal switching characteristics of ME-MTJ to tune the synapses to follow the well-known spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule in a stochastic fashion. Finally, we use the stochastic STDP rule in ME-MTJ synapses to simulate a two-layered SNN to perform image classification tasks on a handwritten digit dataset. Thus, the capacitive write-port and the decoupled-nature of read-write path of ME-MTJs allow us to construct a transistor-less crossbar, suitable for energy-efficient implementation of in situ learning in SNNs.

It includes a clinician-facing action recommendation report that will translate an artificial intelligence algorithm to routine practice and an alert when a positive screening result is found. This report was developed using a user-centered approach via an iterative process with input from multiple physician groups. Such data can be reused and adapted to translate other artificial intelligence algorithms. This article also includes data collection forms we developed for the clinical trial aiming to evaluate the artificial intelligence algorithm. Such materials can be adapted for other clinical trials.", "Despite widespread recognition that coercive methods for intelligence gathering are unethical and counterproductive, there is an absence of empirical evidence for effective alternatives. We compared 2 noncoercive methods-the Modified Cognitive Interview (MCI) and Controlled Cognitive Engagement (CCE)-adapted for intelligence gathering by adding a moral frame to encourage interviewees to consciously consider sharing intelligence. Participants from the general population experienced an unexpected live event where equipment was damaged, and an argument ensued. Prior to interview, participants were incentivized to withhold information about a target individual implicated in the event. CCE yielded more target information more frequently than MCI (67% vs. 36%). Similarly, framing yielded target information more often (65% vs. 39%). The effects of interview and framing appear to be additive rather than interactive. Our results indicate combining noncoercive interview methods with moral framing can enhance intelligence gain.

The emergence of large production concept and technology brought healthcare to 2.0. Bigger hospitals and better medical education were established, and doctors were trained for specialty for better treatment quality. The size of computer shrunk. This allowed fast development of computer-based devices and information technology, leading the healthcare to 3.0. The initiation of smart medicine nowadays announces the arrival of healthcare 4.0 with new brain and new hands. It is an era of big revision of previous technologies, one of which is artificial intelligence which will lead humans to a new world that emphasizes more on advanced and continuous learnings.", "This study aimed to estimate the extent to which the development of symbolic numerosity representations relies on pre-existing non-symbolic numerosity representations that refer to the Approximate Number System. To achieve this aim, we estimated the longitudinal relationships between accuracy in the Number Line (NL) test and \"blue-yellow dots\" test across elementary school children. Data from a four-wave longitudinal study involving schoolchildren in grades 1-4 in Russia and Kyrgyzstan (N = 490, mean age 7.65 years in grade 1) were analyzed. We applied structural equation modeling and tested several competing models. The results revealed that at the start of schooling, the accuracy in the NL test predicted subsequent accuracy in the \"blue-yellow dots\" test, whereas subsequently, non-symbolic representation in grades 2 and 3 predicted subsequent symbolic representation. These results indicate that the effect of non-symbolic representation on symbolic representation emerges after a child masters the basics of symbolic number knowledge, such as counting in the range of twenty and simple arithmetic. We also examined the extent to which the relationships between non-symbolic and symbolic representations might be explained by fluid intelligence, which was measured by Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices test. The results revealed that the effect of symbolic representation on non-symbolic representation was explained by fluid intelligence, whereas at the end of elementary school, non-symbolic representation predicted subsequent symbolic representation independently of fluid intelligence.", "The observed gain in IQ scores over time has been examined and supported. Nonetheless, this phenomenon (also called Flynn effect) may depend on age groups and country types. This article provides raw data from three standardized intelligence tests, namely, Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM), Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM), and Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM). The datasets contain mean IQ scores from APM, CPM, and SPM, and standard deviations, sample sizes, years of publication, participants' groups, types of countries, country-based samples, and gender of participants. This data was obtained from 199, 369, and 176 individual study samples for CPM, SPM, and APM, respectively, and covered a period of 65 years (1950-2014). There were 202,468 participants in total. An analysis and interpretation of results based on a cross-temporal meta-analysis for mean IQ scores from CPM, SPM, and APM over time can be found in the article \"A Cross-Temporal Meta-Analysis of Raven's Progressive Matrices: Age groups and developing versus developed countries\" (Wongupparaj, Kumari, Morris, 2015) [1]. These datasets can provide an extensive overview of the literature on Flynn effect across age groups, countries, and gender. In addition, they can serve as a useful starting point for further meta-analyses of IQ scores derived from CPM, SPM, and APM.", "One of the main, long-term objectives of artificial intelligence is the creation of thinking machines. To that end, substantial effort has been placed into designing cognitive systems; i.e. systems that can manipulate semantic-level information. A substantial part of that effort is oriented towards designing the mathematical machinery underlying cognition in a way that is very efficiently implementable in hardware. In this work, we propose a 'semi-holographic' representation system that can be implemented in hardware using only multiplexing and addition operations, thus avoiding the need for expensive multiplication. The resulting architecture can be readily constructed by recycling standard microprocessor elements and is capable of performing two key mathematical operations frequently used in cognition, superposition and binding, within a budget of below 6\u2009pJ for 64-bit operands. Our proposed 'cognitive processing unit' is intended as just one (albeit crucial) part of much larger cognitive systems where artificial neural networks of all kinds and associative memories work in concord to give rise to intelligence.

Handwritten digit classification using a single-layer artificial neural network (ANN) with a Softmin-based activation function is described as an implementation example. To realize time-mode operation, the presented design makes use of monostable multivibrator-based multiplying analogue-to-time converters, fixed-width pulse generators and basic digital gates. The time-mode digit classification ANN was designed in a standard CMOS 0.18\u2009\u03bcm IC process and operates from a supply voltage of 0.6\u2009V. The system operates on the MNIST database of handwritten digits with quantized neuron weights and has a classification accuracy of 88%, which is typical for single-layer ANNs, while dissipating 65.74\u2009pJ per classification with a speed of 2.37\u2009k classifications per second.

These are the attributes of actual availability. It is crucial to identify the most influential attributes to develop an adequate level of worker's performance.\nThe purpose of this paper is to upgrade the Availability-Humanization-Model (AH-Model) with an implementation of the artificial intelligence classification tree to identify influencing factors of the well-being attributes on human performance, where the identified influencing factors are gripping points for maintaining sustainable performance in real-life conditions of different professions.\nWell-being attributes are collected with the Questionnaire Actual Availability (QAA) from AH-Model and then analysed by implementation of the decision trees classification algorithms. An embedded clustering analysis of QAA ensures an efficient feature construction and selection. It negates the need of applying tree pruning or any other noise reduction algorithms.\nAn implementation of the machine learning algorithms reflects the real conditions of working environments: (a)\u00a0real performance of workers depends on the perception of well-being and availability and (b) the most influencing factors explicitly reflect the content of work in a specific domain (Fintech, health, forestry, traffic) with a high level of stress.\nThe presented approach offers a possibility to identify the most important well-being attributes to determine an adequate efficiency and to improve the performance level in the real working conditions.", "Relying simply on bitwise operators, the recently introduced Tsetlin machine (TM) has provided competitive pattern classification accuracy in several benchmarks, including text understanding. In this paper, we introduce the regression Tsetlin machine (RTM), a new class of TMs designed for continuous input and output, targeting nonlinear regression problems. In all brevity, we convert continuous input into a binary representation based on thresholding, and transform the propositional formula formed by the TM into an aggregated continuous output. Our empirical comparison of the RTM with state-of-the-art regression techniques reveals either superior or on par performance on five datasets.

The novelty of this research is to propose a hybrid early-warning artificial intelligence (AI) framework that can emulate hourly air quality variables (i.e., Particulate Matter 2.5, PM2.5; Particulate Matter 10, PM10 and lower atmospheric visibility, VIS), the atmospheric variables associated with increased respiratory induced mortality and recurrent health-care cost. Firstly, hourly air quality data series (January-2015 to December-2017) are demarcated into their respective intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual sub-series that reveal patterns and resolve data complexity characteristics, followed by partial autocorrelation function applied to each IMF and residual sub-series to unveil historical changes in air quality. To design the prescribed hybrid model, the data is partitioned into training (70%), validation (15%) and testing (15%) sub-sets. The online sequential-extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) algorithm integrated with improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) is designed as a data pre-processing system to robustly extract predictive patterns and fine-tune the model generalization to a near-optimal global solution, which represents modelled air quality at hourly forecast horizons. The resulting early warning AI-based framework denoted as ICEEMDAN-OS-ELM model, is individually constructed by forecasting each IMF and residual sub-series, with hourly PM2.5, PM10, and VIS obtained by the aggregated sum of forecasted IMFs and residual sub-series. The results are benchmarked with many competing predictive approaches; e.g., hybrid ICEEMDAN-multiple-linear regression (MLR), ICEEMDAN-M5 model tree and standalone versions: OS-ELM, MLR, M5 model tree. Statistical metrics including the root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott's Index (WI), Legates & McCabe's Index (ELM) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (ENS) are used to evaluate the model's accuracy. Both visual and statistical results show that the proposed ICEEMDAN-OS-ELM model registers superior results, outperforming alternative comparison approaches. For instance, for PM2.5,ELM values ranged from 0.65-0.82 vs. 0.59-0.77 for ICEEMDAN-M5 tree, 0.59-0.74 for ICEEMDAN-MLR, 0.28-0.54 for OS-ELM, 0.27-0.54 for M5 tree and 0.25-0.53 for the MLR model. For remaining air quality variables (i.e., PM10 & VIS), the objective model (ICEEMDAN-OS-ELM) outperformed the comparative models. In particular, ICEEMDAN-OS-ELM registered relatively low RMSE/MAE, ranging from approximately 0.7-1.03\u00a0\u03bcg/m3(MAE), 1.01-1.47\u00a0\u03bcg/m3(RMSE) for PM2.5 whereas for PM10, these metrics registered a value of 1.29-3.84\u00a0\u03bcg/m3(MAE), 3.01-7.04\u00a0\u03bcg/m3(RMSE) and for Visibility, they were 0.01-3.72\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 (MAE (Mm-1)), 0.04-5.98\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 (RMSE (Mm-1)). Visual analysis of forecasted and observed air quality through a Taylor diagram illustrates the objective model's preciseness, confirming the versatility of early warning AI-model in generating air quality forecasts. The excellent performance ascertains the hybrid model's potential utility for air quality monitoring and subsequent public health risk mitigation.", "Real-time simulation of a large-scale biologically representative spiking neural network is presented, through the use of a heterogeneous parallelization scheme and SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware. A published cortical microcircuit model is used as a benchmark test case, representing \u22481\u2009mm2 of early sensory cortex, containing 77\u2009k neurons and 0.3 billion synapses. This is the first hard real-time simulation of this model, with 10\u2009s of biological simulation time executed in 10\u2009s wall-clock time. This surpasses best-published efforts on HPC neural simulators (3\u2009\u00d7 slowdown) and GPUs running optimized spiking neural network (SNN) libraries (2\u2009\u00d7 slowdown). Furthermore, the presented approach indicates that real-time processing can be maintained with increasing SNN size, breaking the communication barrier incurred by traditional computing machinery. Model results are compared to an established HPC simulator baseline to verify simulation correctness, comparing well across a range of statistical measures. Energy to solution and energy per synaptic event are also reported, demonstrating that the relatively low-tech SpiNNaker processors achieve a 10\u2009\u00d7 reduction in energy relative to modern HPC systems, and comparable energy consumption to modern GPUs. Finally, system robustness is demonstrated through multiple 12\u2009h simulations of the cortical microcircuit, each simulating 12\u2009h of biological time, and demonstrating the potential of neuromorphic hardware as a neuroscience research tool for studying complex spiking neural networks over extended time periods.

Alongside the need for developing highly performance-efficient DNN accelerators, there is an utmost need to improve the yield of the manufacturing process in order to reduce the per unit cost of the DNN accelerators. To this end, we present 'SalvageDNN', a methodology to enable reliable execution of DNNs on the hardware accelerators with permanent faults (typically due to imperfect manufacturing processes). It employs a fault-aware mapping of different parts of a given DNN on the hardware accelerator (subjected to faults) by leveraging the saliency of the DNN parameters and the fault map of the underlying processing hardware. We also present novel modifications in a systolic array design to further improve the yield of the accelerators while ensuring reliable DNN execution using 'SalvageDNN' and negligible overheads in terms of area, power/energy and performance.

We examined sex-specific associations between prepregnancy BMI, GWG, and child neurodevelopment at age 7.\nData are from a prospective low-income cohort of African American and Dominican women (n\u2009=\u2009368; 44.8% male offspring) enrolled during the second half of pregnancy from 1998 to 2006. Neurodevelopment was measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) at approximately child age 7. Linear regression estimated associations between prepregnancy BMI, GWG, and child outcomes, adjusting for race/ethnicity, marital status, gestational age at delivery, maternal education, maternal IQ and child age.\nOverweight affected 23.9% of mothers and obesity affected 22.6%. At age 7, full-scale IQ was higher among girls (99.7\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6) compared to boys (96.9\u2009\u00b1\u200913.3). Among boys, but not girls, prepregnancy overweight and obesity were associated with lower full-scale IQ scores [overweight \u03b2: -\u20097.1, 95% CI: (-\u200912.1, -\u20092.0); obesity \u03b2: -\u20095.7, 95% CI: (-\u200910.7, -\u20090.7)]. GWG was not associated with full-scale IQ in either sex.\nPrepregnancy overweight and obesity were associated with lower IQ among boys, but not girls, at 7\u2009years. These findings are important considering overweight and obesity prevalence and the long-term implications of early cognitive development.", "As a physiological signal, EEG data cannot be subjectively changed or hidden. Compared with other physiological signals, EEG signals are directly related to human cortical activities with excellent temporal resolution. After the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the analysis and calculation of EEGs has made great progress, leading to a significant boost in performances for content understanding and pattern recognition of brain activities across the areas of both neural science and computer vision. While such an enormous advance has attracted wide range of interests among relevant research communities, EEG-based classification of brain activities evoked by images still demands efforts for further improvement with respect to its accuracy, generalization, and interpretation, yet some characters of human brains have been relatively unexplored.\nWe propose a region-level stacked bi-directional deep learning framework for EEG-based image classification. Inspired by the hemispheric lateralization of human brains, we propose to extract additional information at regional level to strengthen and emphasize the differences between two hemispheres. The stacked bi-directional long short-term memories are used to capture the dynamic correlations hidden from both the past and the future to the current state in EEG sequences.\nExtensive experiments are carried out and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Compared with the existing state-of-the-arts, our framework achieves outstanding performances in EEG-based classification of brain activities evoked by images. In addition, we find that the signals of Gamma band are not only useful for achieving good performances for EEG-based image classification, but also play a significant role in capturing relationships between the neural activations and the specific emotional states.\nOur proposed framework provides an improved solution for the problem that, given an image used to stimulate brain activities, we should be able to identify which class the stimuli image comes from by analyzing the EEG signals. The region-level information is extracted to preserve and emphasize the hemispheric lateralization for neural functions or cognitive processes of human brains. Further, stacked bi-directional LSTMs are used to capture the dynamic correlations hidden in EEG data. Extensive experiments on standard EEG-based image classification dataset validate that our framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-arts under various contexts and experimental setups.", "For decades, the design of untethered devices has been focused on delivering a fixed quality of service with minimum power consumption, to enable battery-powered devices with reasonably long deployment lifetime. However, to realize the promised tens of billions of connected devices in the Internet of Things, computers must operate autonomously and harvest ambient energy to avoid the cost and maintenance requirements imposed by mains- or battery-powered operation. But harvested power typically fluctuates, often unpredictably, and with large temporal and spatial variability. Energy-driven computers are designed to treat energy-availability as a first-class citizen, in order to gracefully adapt to the dynamics of energy harvesting. They may sleep through periods of no energy, endure periods of scarce energy, and capitalize on periods of ample energy. In this paper, we describe the promise and limitations of energy-driven computing, with an emphasis on intermittent operation.

We assume that, in spite of the suffering inherent to health care work, it can have a creative and potent dimension in the exercise of care, even in the presence of the challenges faced by the precarious working conditions, the growing demand of patients and the demands of productivity. Participant observation, in-depth interviews and group interviews were carried out with a selected nursing staff. We observed two main forms of practical intelligence manifestations. The first is the exercise of speaking and listening. The second, as an exercise in the production of comfort. Such forms of practical intelligence interpenetrate and cannot be captured by numbers, indicators, and methods of performance evaluation. They are invisible to instruments that do not go through the word of the workers. We conclude that it is necessary to create collective spaces in health organizations where managers and workers can express and dialogue on such issues, socially validating this know-how and those workers'experiences.\nEste artigo resulta de uma pesquisa cujo objeto \u00e9 o saber-fazer dos trabalhadores de enfermagem.

Many of these advances have come through mimicking the morphology of human skin and by distributing few touch sensors in an area. However, the complexity of human skin goes beyond mimicking few morphological features or using few sensors. For example, embedded computing (e.g. processing of tactile data at the point of contact) is centric to the human skin as some neuroscience studies show. Likewise, distributed cell or molecular energy is a key feature of human skin. The eSkin with such features, along with distributed and embedded sensors/electronics on soft substrates, is an interesting topic to explore. These features also make eSkin significantly different from conventional computing. For example, unlike conventional centralized computing enabled by miniaturized chips, the eSkin could be seen as a flexible and wearable large area computer with distributed sensors and harmonized energy. This paper discusses these advanced features in eSkin, particularly the distributed sensing harmoniously integrated with energy harvesters, storage devices and distributed computing to read and locally process the tactile sensory data. Rapid advances in neuromorphic hardware, flexible energy generation, energy-conscious electronics, flexible and printed electronics are also discussed.

Examples include wireless sensors, wearables and cybernetic systems that collect data and process them to support real-world decisions and controls. For energy autonomy, these applications are typically powered by energy harvesters. As harvesters and other power sources which provide energy autonomy inevitably have power variations, the circuits need to robustly operate over a dynamic power envelope. In other words, the NN hardware needs to be able to function correctly under unpredictable and variable supply voltages. In this paper, we propose a novel NN design approach using the principle of pulse width modulation (PWM). PWM signals represent information with their duty cycle values which may be made independent of the voltages and frequencies of the carrier signals. We design a PWM-based perceptron which can serve as the fundamental building block for NNs, by using an entirely new method of realizing arithmetic in the PWM domain. We analyse the proposed approach building from a 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093 perceptron circuit to a complex multi-layer NN. Using handwritten character recognition as an exemplar of AI applications, we demonstrate the power elasticity, resilience and efficiency of the proposed NN design in the presence of functional and parametric variations including large voltage variations in the power supply.

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of bimanual coordination in music interventions on cognitive performance in healthy older adults (60-80 years). Participants (N = 135) completed motor measures and battery of standardized cognitive measures, before and after a 16-week music training program with a 3 h practice requirement. All participants were matched by age, education, and estimate of intelligence to one of three training programs: piano training (fine motor); percussion instruction (gross motor), and music listening instruction (MLI) (no motor control condition). Results of a Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed significant enhancements in bimanual synchronization and visual scanning/working memory abilities for fine and gross motor training groups as compared to MLI. Pairwise comparisons revealed that piano training significantly improved motor synchronization skills as compared to percussion instruction or music listening. Results suggest that active music performance may benefit working memory, the extent of these benefits may depend upon coordination demands.", "To investigate intellectual development after functional hemispherectomy and to evaluate the favorable or unfavorable factors affecting prognosis.\nTwenty-three patients from the patient follow-up database of the Epilepsy Center of Neurosurgery were selected for this retrospective study. The inclusion criteria of the patients were functional hemispherectomy surgery, surgical age older than 6 years, patients able to complete the intelligence assessment, follow-up time not less than 2 years, and availability of complete preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow-up data. Full Scale Intelligence Quotients (FSIQ) were calculated preoperatively and at the follow-up times for each patient. Correlations between the preoperative to postoperative changes in FSIQ and risk factors (age at epilepsy onset, duration of preoperative epilepsy, postoperative changes in the electroencephalogram, seizure status after surgery, and follow-up time) were analyzed. EpiData 3.1 software was used to establish a database and SPSS 22.0 software was used for data collation and analysis, and used the matching sample Wilcoxon symbol rank and test to conduct the analysis.\nThe data of 23 patients were analyzed. The final follow-up results showed that 73.9% of the patients (17/23) had a significant increase in FSIQ scores (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) after surgery, indicating that their cognitive function improved significantly. Successful surgery, successful postoperative seizure control, normalization of postoperative electroencephalogram, shorter disease duration before surgery, and longer recovery periods after surgery (follow-up time) were all related with good intellectual prognosis.\nSuccessful functional hemispherectomy significantly improved the cognitive function of patients. Functional hemispherectomy is a safe and effective treatment for patients with intractable epilepsy caused by hemispheric lesions and can effectively promote intellectual recovery and development.", "In this study, we examined a large sample of 231 generally healthy older adults across 4\u00a0years with regard to several brain anatomical measures (volumes of total grey matter volume: GM, normal appearing white matter: NAWM, lateral ventricle: LV, and white matter hypointensities: WMH) and psychometric intelligence (verbal and non-verbal). The dataset comprised four measurement occasions (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 4-year follow-ups). With this longitudinal data set, we evaluated level-level, level-change, and change-change relationships between the anatomical and psychometric measures using latent growth curve models. Our analyses indicate that GM and NAWM decreased significantly over the course of 4\u00a0years with annual percent changes of -\u20090.73% and -\u20090.79%, respectively. WMH and LV volumes increase with annual percent changes of 7.3% and 4%, respectively. Verbal and nonverbal IQ measures remained stable in our sample. In addition, we uncovered evidence for level-level and -change associations between several of the brain anatomical measures. With regard to brain-IQ associations, we observed a positive level-level association for GM and NAWM, indicating that participants with larger brain volumes demonstrate higher IQ measures. No substantial evidence was identified for level- or change-change associations between any of the brain metrics and the IQ measures. Taken together, these results suggest that while healthy older adults demonstrated age-related neuroanatomical decline over a time span of 4\u00a0years, these degenerative changes are not necessarily linked to simultaneous cognitive deterioration.", "Despite the application of advanced statistical and pharmacometric approaches to pediatric trial data, a large pediatric evidence gap still remains. Here, we discuss how to collect more data from children by using real-world data from electronic health records, mobile applications, wearables, and social media. The large datasets collected with these approaches enable and may demand the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to allow the data to be analyzed for decision making. Applications of this approach are presented, which include the prediction of future clinical complications, medical image analysis, identification of new pediatric end points and biomarkers, the prediction of treatment nonresponders, and the prediction of placebo-responders for trial enrichment. Finally, we discuss how to bring machine learning from science to pediatric clinical practice. We conclude that advantage should be taken of the current opportunities offered by innovations in data science and machine learning to close the pediatric evidence gap.", "Quantum compilation is the task of translating a quantum algorithm implemented in a high-level quantum programming language into a technology-dependent instructions flow for a physical quantum computer. To tackle the large gap between the quantum program and the low-level instructions, quantum compilation is split into a multi-stage flow consisting of several layers of abstraction. Several different individual tasks have been proposed for the layers in the flow, many of them are NP-hard. In this article, we will describe the flow and we will propose algorithms based on Boolean satisfiability, which is a good match to tackle such computationally complex problems. This article is part of the theme issue 'Harmonizing energy-autonomous computing and intelligence'.", "We present PULP-NN, an optimized computing library for a parallel ultra-low-power tightly coupled cluster of RISC-V processors. The key innovation in PULP-NN is a set of kernels for quantized neural network inference, targeting byte and sub-byte data types, down to INT-1, tuned for the recent trend toward aggressive quantization in deep neural network inference. The proposed library exploits both the digital signal processing extensions available in the PULP RISC-V processors and the cluster's parallelism, achieving up to 15.5\u2009MACs/cycle on INT-8 and improving performance by up to 63\u2009\u00d7 with respect to a sequential implementation on a single RISC-V core implementing the baseline RV32IMC ISA. Using PULP-NN, a CIFAR-10 network on an octa-core cluster runs in 30\u2009\u00d7 and 19.6\u2009\u00d7 less clock cycles than the current state-of-the-art ARM CMSIS-NN library, running on STM32L4 and STM32H7 MCUs, respectively. The proposed library, when running on a GAP-8 processor, outperforms by 36.8\u2009\u00d7 and by 7.45\u2009\u00d7 the execution on energy efficient MCUs such as STM32L4 and high-end MCUs such as STM32H7 respectively, when operating at the maximum frequency. The energy efficiency on GAP-8 is 14.1\u2009\u00d7 higher than STM32L4 and 39.5\u2009\u00d7 higher than STM32H7, at the maximum efficiency operating point.

The authors used Bafa Bafa\u00a9, a cross-cultural low-fidelity simulation, to further develop critical thinking and emotional intelligence skills in prelicensure nursing students. This article describes the authors' experiences of integrating this innovative teaching strategy in the classroom to increase cultural awareness. The students' discovery of unexpected feelings, thoughts, and perceptions has the potential to extend beyond the simulated experience when coupled with faculty reinforcement of engaging in self-reflective practice as a professional nurse.", "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and wearable computing are creating novel technological opportunities for mitigating the global burden of population ageing and improving the quality of care for older adults with dementia and/or age-related disability. Intelligent assistive technology (IAT) is the umbrella term defining this ever-evolving spectrum of intelligent applications for the older and disabled population. However, the implementation of IATs has been observed to be sub-optimal due to a number of barriers in the translation of novel applications from the designing labs to the bedside. Furthermore, since these technologies are designed to be used by vulnerable individuals with age- and multi-morbidity-related frailty and cognitive disability, they are perceived to raise important ethical challenges, especially when they involve machine intelligence, collect sensitive data or operate in close proximity to the human body. Thus, the goal of this paper is to explore and assess the ethical issues that professional stakeholders perceive in the development and use of IATs in elderly and dementia care.\nWe conducted a multi-site study involving semi-structured qualitative interviews with researchers and health professionals. We analyzed the interview data using a descriptive thematic analysis to inductively explore relevant ethical challenges.\nOur findings indicate that professional stakeholders find issues of patient autonomy and informed consent, quality of data management, distributive justice and human contact as ethical priorities. Divergences emerged in relation to how these ethical issues are interpreted, how conflicts between different ethical principles are resolved and what solutions should be implemented to overcome current challenges.\nOur findings indicate a general agreement among professional stakeholders on the ethical promises and challenges raised by the use of IATs among older and disabled users. Yet, notable divergences persist regarding how these ethical challenges can be overcome and what strategies should be implemented for the safe and effective implementation of IATs. These findings provide technology developers with useful information about unmet ethical needs. Study results may guide policy makers with firsthand information from relevant stakeholders about possible solutions for ethically-aligned technology governance.", "Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) occurs in approximately 10-12% of treatments. Whereas several definitions for IDH are available, a nadir systolic blood pressure carries the strongest relation with outcome. Whereas the relation between IDH may partly be based on patient characteristics, it is likely that also impaired organ perfusion leading to permanent damage, plays a role in this relationship. The pathogenesis of IDH is multifactorial and is based on a combination of a decline in blood volume (BV) and impaired vascular resistance at a background of a reduced cardiovascular reserve. Measurements of absolute BV based on an on-line dilution method appear more promising than relative BV measurements in the prediction of IDH. Also, feedback treatments in which ultrafiltration rate is automatically adjusted based on changes in relative BV have not yet resulted in improvement. Frequent assessment of dry weight, attempting to reduce interdialytic weight gain and prescribing more frequent or longer dialysis treatments may aid in preventing IDH. The impaired vascular response can be improved using isothermic or cool dialysis treatment which has also been associated with a reduction in end organ damage, although their effect on mortality has not yet been assessed. For the future, identification of vulnerable patients based on artificial intelligence and on-line assessment of markers of organ perfusion may aid in individualizing treatment prescription, which will always remain dependent on the clinical context of the patient.", "With the fast development of the fifth-generation cellular network technology (5G), the future sensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)/nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are presenting a more and more critical role to provide information in our daily life. This review paper introduces the development trends and perspectives of the future sensors and MEMS/NEMS. Starting from the issues of the MEMS fabrication, we introduced typical MEMS sensors for their applications in the Internet of Things (IoTs), such as MEMS physical sensor, MEMS acoustic sensor, and MEMS gas sensor. Toward the trends in intelligence and less power consumption, MEMS components including MEMS/NEMS switch, piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT), and MEMS energy harvesting were investigated to assist the future sensors, such as event-based or almost zero-power. Furthermore, MEMS rigid substrate toward NEMS flexible-based for flexibility and interface was discussed as another important development trend for next-generation wearable or multi-functional sensors. Around the issues about the big data and human-machine realization for human beings' manipulation, artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) technologies were finally realized using sensor nodes and its wave identification as future trends for various scenarios.", "After implementing a formal resident well-being and resiliency program in our surgery residency, we performed in-depth qualitative interviews to understand residents' perceptions of: (1) the impact and benefits, (2) the essential elements for success, and (3) the desired changes to the well-being program.\nThe well-being program is structured to address mental, physical, and social aspects of resident well-being through monthly experiential sessions. All General Surgery residents participated in the program; content is delivered during residents' protected educational time. For this study, we conducted individual semistructured interviews: residents were asked for their feedback to understand the value, benefits, and drawbacks of program.\nAccreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited General Surgery residency program PARTICIPANTS: We used purposeful selection to maximize diversity in recruiting residents who had participated in program for at least 1 year. Recruitment continued until themes were saturated. Eleven residents were interviewed including 2 from each residency year.\nResidents reported benefits in 3 thematic spheres: (1) Culture/Community, (2) Communication/Emotional Intelligence, and (3) Work-Life Integration Skills. Key structural elements of success for a well-being program included a committed leader, a receptive department culture, occurrence during protected time, and interactive sessions that taught applicable life skills. In discussing opportunities for improvement, residents desired more faculty-level involvement. Some residents were skeptical of the benefit of time spent learning nontechnical skills; some wanted more emphasis placed on accountability to patients and work.\nOur qualitative assessment of a novel resident well-being program demonstrates reported benefits that reflect the intent of the program. Residents most benefited from sessions that were interactive, introduced readily applicable skills for their day-to-day lives, and included reinforcement of principles through experiential learning. Engagement of the department leadership is essential to the success of the program, as is ongoing feedback and modification to ensure that program is tailored to the needs of residents.", "We conducted this study to analyze the EEG abnormalities of cognitive impairment and epileptic seizures in patients with epilepsy, as well as to investigate the application value of EEG in the diagnosis of epilepsy with cognitive impairment.\n62 cases of patients that were admitted to our hospital for the first diagnosis as status epilepticus were selected. Of those, 20 cases were accompanied by cognitive impairment. The America Biology Graphene type 24 leads channel video EEG was applied to monitor staging, index, frequency, and distribution range of epileptic discharge. The revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised in China (WAIS-RC) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised in China (WMS-RC) were adopted to test cognitive function.\nThe epileptic discharge index, discharge frequency and discharge distribution range of the conscious period, sleep I-II period and sleep III-IV period of epilepsy with the cognitive impairment group were evidently higher than those of epilepsy without cognitive impairment group. The differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and Memory Quotient (MQ) level of the cognitive impairment group were the lowest in sleep III-IV period, with the next being the sleep I-II period; the highest was the conscious period, and the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). With an increase of the epileptic discharge index, the discharge range, IQ and MQ level of cognitive impairment group decreased; differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). Therefore, the discharge index, frequency, and distribution range of epileptic discharge of epilepsy with cognitive impairment in different periods differed from epilepsy patients without cognitive impairment. According to the extent of cognitive impairment in different stages, discharge index, frequency, and distribution range were also different.\nThe 24 h video EEG, which was used to monitor epileptic discharge characteristics, has a great application value for early identification of epilepsy with cognitive impairment.", "In this paper, through the research of digital twin technology, combined with the application of vision sensor, artificial intelligence chip and deep learning algorithm technology, the real-time monitoring and alarm system of elderly fall and abnormal posture based on digital twin technology is developed. The system collects the data of the posture and behavior of the elderly, and then presents them in the cloud by digital mapping after the calculation and analysis of artificial intelligence chip. Once the safety threshold is deviated, the alarm can be activated to avoid or mitigate the injury caused by the fall of the elderly. Through product validation and trial operation of Tianbao Nursing Home in Hongkou District of Shanghai, the user can set alarm thresholds in different time periods and regions, thus achieving the preset purpose of the product.", "Molecules composed of atoms exhibit properties not inherent to their constituent atoms. Similarly, metamolecules consisting of multiple meta-atoms possess emerging features that the meta-atoms themselves do not possess. Metasurfaces composed of metamolecules with spatially variant building blocks, such as gradient metasurfaces, are drawing substantial attention due to their unconventional controllability of the amplitude, phase, and frequency of light. However, the intricate mechanisms and the large degrees of freedom of the multielement systems impede an effective strategy for the design and optimization of metamolecules. Here, a hybrid artificial-intelligence-based framework consolidating compositional pattern-producing networks and cooperative coevolution to resolve the inverse design of metamolecules in metasurfaces is proposed. The framework breaks the design of the metamolecules into separate designs of meta-atoms, and independently solves the smaller design tasks of the meta-atoms through deep learning and evolutionary algorithms. The proposed framework is leveraged to design metallic metamolecules for arbitrary manipulation of the polarization and wavefront of light. Moreover, the efficacy and reliability of the design strategy are confirmed through experimental validations. This framework reveals a promising candidate approach to expedite the design of large-scale metasurfaces in a labor-saving, systematic manner.", "The medical specialty radiology has experienced a number of extremely important and influential technical developments in the past that have affected how medical imaging is deployed.

While it has led to many advances and applications in daily life, its introduction in medicine is still in its infancy. AI has created interesting perspectives for medical research and clinical practice but has been sometimes associated with hype leading to a misunderstanding of its real capabilities.

Emotional intelligence (EI) is thought to be important in problem-solving related to breastfeeding. Research Aims: The study was conducted to investigate the correlation between the EI and breastfeeding self-efficacy (BFSE) of women in the early postpartum period and the associated factors. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in cesarean-postpartum service of a hospital in Erzurum between May 2015 and May 2016. The sample of the study consisted of 271 women. The dependent variables constituted the EI and BFSE mean scores. Descriptive statistics, independent samples t tests, one-way analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Pearson correlation analysis were used. Results: The age, education level, perceived income status, and the status of planned pregnancy of the mothers affected their EI mean score, whereas their residence place, income status, the number of pregnancy and living children, and status of receiving prenatal care affected their BFSE levels. No significant correlation was found between the EI and BFSE mean scores in the early postpartum period (r\u2009=\u20090.77, p\u2009=\u20090.207). Conclusions: No significant correlation was determined between the EI and BFSE in the early postpartum period.", "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is rare and, if untreated, has a median survival of 2-3\u2009years. Pulmonary arterial hypertension may be idiopathic (IPAH) but is frequently associated with other conditions. Despite increased awareness, therapeutic advances, and improved outcomes, the time from symptom onset to diagnosis remains unchanged. The commonest symptoms of PAH (breathlessness and fatigue) are non-specific and clinical signs are usually subtle, frequently preventing early diagnosis where therapies may be more effective. The failure to improve the time to diagnosis largely reflects an inability to identify patients at increased risk of PAH using current approaches. To date, strategies to improve the time to diagnosis have focused on screening patients with a high prevalence [systemic sclerosis (10%), patients with portal hypertension assessed for liver transplantation (2-6%), carriers of mutations of the gene encoding bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II, and first-degree relatives of patients with heritable PAH]. In systemic sclerosis, screening algorithms have demonstrated that patients can be identified earlier, however, current approaches are resource intensive. Until, recently, it has not been considered possible to screen populations for rare conditions such as IPAH (prevalence 5-15/million/year). However, there is interest in the use of artificial intelligence approaches in medicine and the application of diagnostic algorithms to large healthcare data sets, to identify patients at risk of rare conditions. In this article, we review current approaches and challenges in screening for PAH and explore novel population-based approaches to improve detection.", "Traditional handcrafted crowd-counting techniques in an image are currently transformed via machine-learning and artificial-intelligence techniques into intelligent crowd-counting techniques. This paradigm shift offers many advanced features in terms of adaptive monitoring and the control of dynamic crowd gatherings. Adaptive monitoring, identification/recognition, and the management of diverse crowd gatherings can improve many crowd-management-related tasks in terms of efficiency, capacity, reliability, and safety. Despite many challenges, such as occlusion, clutter, and irregular object distribution and nonuniform object scale, convolutional neural networks are a promising technology for intelligent image crowd counting and analysis. In this article, we review, categorize, analyze (limitations and distinctive features), and provide a detailed performance evaluation of the latest convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. We also highlight the potential applications of convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. Finally, we conclude this article by presenting our key observations, providing strong foundation for future research directions while designing convolutional-neural-network-based crowd-counting techniques. Further, the article discusses new advancements toward understanding crowd counting in smart cities using the Internet of Things (IoT).", "Image outliers such as missing correspondences and large local deformations break the one-to-one pixelwise mapping between target image and moving image to be registered. Both traditional registration methods and deep-learning based deformable image registration methods fail to tackle this problem. This paper proposed an unsupervised globalto-local deformable registration network reinforced by joint saliency map to accurately, robustly and fast address the problem. The global-to-local network divided the overall learning of a complex mapping of image registration into a simpler global mapping learning and local residual mapping. The joint saliency map of the two images to be registered bidirectionally reinforced the whole network's forward estimation and back-propagation with uncertainty modeling and context-aware intelligence. The experimental results confirm the proposed method's performance advantages over the state-of-the-arts registration methods in the challenges image registration with missing correspondences and large local deformations.", "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly expanding fields with increasing relevance in anesthesia and, in particular, airway management. The ability of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to recognize patterns from large volumes of complex data makes them attractive for use in pediatric anesthesia airway management. The purpose of this review is to introduce artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning to the pediatric anesthesiologist. Current evidence and developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning relevant to pediatric airway management are presented. We critically assess the current evidence on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the assessment, diagnosis, monitoring, procedure assistance, and predicting outcomes during pediatric airway management. Further, we discuss the limitations of these technologies and offer areas for focused research that may bring pediatric airway management anesthesiology into the era of artificial intelligence and machine learning.", "The adult diffusely infiltrating low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are typically IDH mutant and slow-growing gliomas having moderately increased cellularity generally without mitosis, necrosis, and microvascular proliferation. Supra-total resection of LGG significantly increases the overall survival by delaying malignant transformation compared with a simple debulking so accurate MR diagnosis is crucial for treatment planning. Data from meta-analysis support the addition of diffusion and perfusion-weighted MR imaging and MR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of suspected LGG. Typically, LGG has lower cellularity (ADCmin), angiogenesis (rCBVmax), capillary permeability (Ktrans), and mitotic activity (Cho/Cr ratio) compared to high-grade glioma. The identification of 2-hydroxyglutarate by MR spectroscopy can reflect the IDH status of the tumor. The initial low ADCmin, high rCBVmax, and Ktrans values are consistent with the poor prognosis. The gradual increase in intratumoral Cho/Cr ratio and rCBVmax values are well correlated with tumor progression. Besides MR-based technical artifacts, which are minimized by the voxel-based assessment of data obtained by histogram analysis, the problems derived from the diversity and the analysis of imaging data should be solved by using artificial intelligence techniques. The quantitative multiparametric MR imaging of LGG can either improve the diagnostic accuracy of their differential diagnosis or assess their prognosis.", "As a senior health care administrator in both the Northern and Southern California Regions of Kaiser Permanente, I was intrigued by ways to enhance the skills of a new physician leader. The role of a leader is to help others succeed. Although emotional intelligence is a key characteristic of an effective leader, skills and behaviors can be learned and leaders can be developed. Emerging leaders can learn to listen to various points of view, develop a \"let's go see\" attitude, gather all the facts before making a decision, train others to be leaders, embrace a spirit of adventure, and develop a knowledge of statistics and finance. Additionally, recognizing and avoiding common pitfalls in leadership will augment effective leadership skills and behaviors.", "The aim of this investigation was to create an automated cephalometric X\u2011ray analysis using a\u00a0specialized artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. We compared the accuracy of this analysis to the current gold standard (analyses performed by human experts) to evaluate precision and clinical application of such an approach in orthodontic routine.\nFor training of the network, 12\u00a0experienced examiners identified 18\u00a0landmarks on a\u00a0total of 1792\u00a0cephalometric X\u2011rays. To evaluate quality of the predictions of the AI, both AI and each examiner analyzed 12\u00a0commonly used orthodontic parameters on a\u00a0basis of 50\u00a0cephalometric X\u2011rays that were not part of the training data for the AI. Median values of the 12\u00a0examiners for each parameter were defined as humans' gold standard and compared to the AI's predictions.\nThere were almost no statistically significant differences between humans' gold standard and the AI's predictions. Differences between the two analyses do not seem to be clinically relevant.\nWe created an AI algorithm able to analyze unknown cephalometric X\u2011rays at almost the same quality level as experienced human examiners (current gold standard). This study is one of the first to successfully enable implementation of AI into dentistry, in particular orthodontics, satisfying medical requirements.", "This study assessed the reliability and criterion-related validity of teacher ratings on the Adapted Skillstreaming Checklist for a sample of 133 children, aged 6-11\u2009years, with autism spectrum disorder (without intellectual disability). Internal consistency for the total sample was 0.93. For a subsample, test-retest reliability was very good (r\u2009=\u20090.74; intraclass correlation coefficient\u2009=\u20090.85) at a 9-month interval. Child age, intelligence quotient, language abilities, and sex were not associated with the Adapted Skillstreaming Checklist total score. The Adapted Skillstreaming Checklist total score was inversely and strongly related to teacher ratings of autism spectrum disorder symptom severity. Significant positive correlations (moderate-to-high) were found between the Adapted Skillstreaming Checklist and prosocial skills scales and significant negative correlations (low-to-moderate) with problem behavior scales on a broad measure of child functioning. Implications and suggestions for future study are discussed.", "Artificial intelligence-assisted image recognition technology is currently able to detect the target area of an image and fetch information to make classifications according to target features. This study aimed to use deep neural networks for computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of perigastric metastatic lymph nodes (PGMLNs) to simulate the recognition of lymph nodes by radiologists, and to acquire more accurate identification results.\nA total of 1371 images of suspected lymph node metastasis from enhanced abdominal CT scans were identified and labeled by radiologists and were used with 18,780 original images for faster region-based convolutional neural networks (FR-CNN) deep learning. The identification results of 6000 random CT images from 100 gastric cancer patients by the FR-CNN were compared with results obtained from radiologists in terms of their identification accuracy. Similarly, 1004 CT images with metastatic lymph nodes that had been post-operatively confirmed by pathological examination and 11,340 original images were used in the identification and learning processes described above. The same 6000 gastric cancer CT images were used for the verification, according to which the diagnosis results were analyzed.\nIn the initial group, precision-recall curves were generated based on the precision rates, the recall rates of nodule classes of the training set and the validation set; the mean average precision (mAP) value was 0.5019. To verify the results of the initial learning group, the receiver operating characteristic curves was generated, and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) value was calculated as 0.8995. After the second phase of precise learning, all the indicators were improved, and the mAP and AUC values were 0.7801 and 0.9541, respectively.\nThrough deep learning, FR-CNN achieved high judgment effectiveness and recognition accuracy for CT diagnosis of PGMLNs.\nChinese Clinical Trial Registry, No. ChiCTR1800016787; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=28515.", "The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between physical exercise and creative thinking. A systematic review approach was employed by searching PubMed, Google Scholar and PsychInfo databases. Among the evaluated 13 studies, 92% indicated a beneficial relationship. However, 77% were vulnerable to moderate-high risk for methodological bias, suggesting adherence to standardized and controlled research initiatives should be promoted. There appears to be weak to modest support for acute, moderate-intensity exercise to benefit creativity. Exercise timing relative to creativity assessment protocols should be addressed and further detailed. Creativity scoring procedures must be refined, and an increased focus on the motivational components of exercise may help guide researchers in measuring creative thoughts and behavior. Broader concluding claims that creativity, in general, is improved or impaired by exercise, is as problematic as sweeping statements that exercise improves or impairs a measure as dynamic as intelligence. Scientific inquiries must specify precisely which outcome characteristics are changing in line with research interventions. This review identifies several fallible linkages between physical activity and creativity. Too few studies were conducted on strong methodological foundations, perpetuating the risk for undermining or inaccurately inflating the potential association between exercise and creative thinking behavior.", "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandated the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes on October 1, 2015. Postmarketing surveillance of newly marketed drugs, including novel biologics and biosimilars, requires a robust approach to convert ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes for study variables. We examined three mapping methods for health conditions (HCs) of interest to the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) and compared their prevalence.\nUsing CMS General Equivalence Mappings, we applied forward-backward mapping (FBM) to 108 HCs and secondary mapping (SM) and tertiary mapping (TM) to seven preselected HCs. A physician reviewed the mapped ICD-10 codes. The prevalence of the 108 HCs defined by ICD-9 versus ICD-10 codes was examined in BBCIC's distributed research network (September 1, 2012 to March 31, 2018). We visually assessed prevalence trends of these HCs and applied a threshold of 20% level change in ICD-9 versus ICD-10 prevalence.\nNearly four times more ICD-10 codes were mapped by SM and TM than FBM, but most were irrelevant or nonspecific. For conditions like myocardial infarction, SM or TM did not generate additional ICD-10 codes. Through visual inspection, one-fifth of the HCs had inconsistent ICD-9 versus ICD-10 prevalence trends. 13% of HCs had a level change greater than +/-20%.\nFBM is generally the most efficient way to convert ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes, yet manual review of converted ICD-10 codes is recommended even for FBM. The lack of existing guidance to compare the performance of ICD-9 with ICD-10 codes led to challenges in empirically determining the quality of conversions.", "Processing speed is frequently reduced in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS). Reduced processing speed can also lead to impaired working memory capacity (WMC) in adult MS patients. Less is known about the interplay of cognitive deficits in paediatric MS patients.\nIn the present study, we investigated whether processing speed and WMC are reduced in paediatric MS patients compared with healthy controls and whether reduced processing speed and WMC might explain potential differences in psychometric intelligence between MS patients and healthy controls.\nTwenty-one paediatric MS patients and 21 healthy controls completed a reaction time (RT) task, a working memory task, and Cattell's Culture Fair Test (CFT20-R).\nPatients with MS had slower RT and lower intelligence scores than healthy controls. We could find no significant differences for WMC. An analysis of covariance revealed that group differences in intelligence could be partially explained by processing speed differences.\nThe results indicate that processing speed is a good marker for MS-related impaired efficiency and increased error-proneness of the central nervous system in higher-order cognition as required by Cattell's CFT20-R.", "Over the last two decades, the evidence has been growing that in addition to epileptic spikes high frequency oscillations (HFOs) are important biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue. New methods of artificial intelligence such as deep learning neural networks can provide additional tools for automated analysis of EEG. Here we present a Long Short-Term Memory neural network for detection of spikes, ripples and ripples-on-spikes (RonS). We used intracranial EEG (iEEG) from two independent datasets. First dataset (7 patients) was used for network training and testing. The second dataset (5 patients) was used for cross-institutional validation. 1000 events of each class (spike, RonS, ripple and baseline) were selected from the candidates initially found using a novel threshold method. Network training was performed using random selections of 50-500 events (per class) from all patients from the 1st dataset. This 'global' network was then tested on other events for each patient from both datasets. The network was able to detect events with a good generalisability namely, with total accuracy and specificity for each class exceeding 90% in all cases, and sensitivity less than 86% in only two cases (82.5% for spikes in one patient and 81.9% for ripples in another patient). The deep learning networks can significantly accelerate the analysis of iEEG data and increase their diagnostic value which may improve surgical outcome in patients with localization-related intractable epilepsy.", "High-resolution MRI is regarded as the best method to evaluate whether there is an involved circumferential resection margin in rectal cancer.\nWe explored the application of the faster region-based convolutional neural network to identify positive circumferential resection margins in high-resolution MRI images.\nThis was a retrospective study.\nThe study conducted at a single surgical unit of a public university hospital.\nWe studied 240 patients with rectal cancer in the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from July 2016 to August 2018, who were determined to have a positive circumferential resection margin and who had received a high-resolution MRI. All posttreatment cases were excluded from this study.\nThe faster region-based convolutional neural network was trained by 12,258 transverse relaxation-weighted (T2-weighted imaging) images of pelvic high-resolution MRI to build an artificial intelligence platform and complete clinical tests. In this network, the proportion of positive and negative circumferential resection margin images was 1:2. In accordance with the test results of the validation group, the metrics of the receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve were applied to compare the diagnostic results of the artificial intelligence platform with those of senior radiology experts.\nIn this artificial intelligence platform, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the circumferential resection margin status as determined were 0.932, 0.838, and 0.956. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves was 0.953. The time required to automatically recognize an image was 0.2 seconds.\nThis is a single-center retrospective study with limited data volume and a highly selected patient cohort.\nIn high-resolution MRI images of rectal cancer before treatment, the application of faster region-based convolutional neural network to segment the positive circumferential resection margin has high accuracy and feasibility.

Consulte Video Resumen en http://links.lww.com/DCR/B88.", "Although many machine learning algorithms have been developed to detect anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the performance of different algorithms required further investigation. The objectives of this current systematic review are to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of machine-learning-assisted detection for ACL injury based on MRI and find the current best algorithm.\nWe will conduct a comprehensive database search for clinical diagnostic tests in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of science without restrictions on publication status and language. The reference lists of the included articles will also be checked to identify additional studies for potential inclusion. Two reviewers will independently review all literature for inclusion and assess their methodological quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2. Clinical diagnostic tests exploring the efficacy of machine-learning-assisted system for detecting ACL injury based on MRI will be considered for inclusion. Another 2 reviewers will independently extract data from eligible studies based on a pre-designed standardized form. Any disagreements will be resolved by consensus. RevMan 5.3 and Stata SE 12.0 software will be used for data synthesis. If appropriate, we will calculate the summary sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of machine-learning-assisted diagnosis system for ACL injury detection. A hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curve will also be plotted, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is going to calculated using the bivariate model. If the pooling of results is considered inappropriate, we will present and describe our findings in diagrams and tables and describe them narratively.\nThis is the first systematic assessment of machine learning system for the detection of ACL injury based on MRI. We predict it will provide highquality synthesis of existing evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of machine-learning-assisted detection for ACL injury and a relatively comprehensive reference for clinical practice and development of interdisciplinary field of artificial intelligence and medicine.\nThis protocol outlined the significance and methodologically details of a systematic review of machine-learning-assisted detection for ACL injury based on MRI. The ongoing systematic review will provide high-quality synthesis of current evidence of machine learning system for detecting ACL injury.\nThe meta-analysis has been prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019136581).", "The global number of people over the age of 60 years is expected to increase from 970 million to 2.1 billion in 2050 and 3.1 billion in 2100. About 80% of the aging population will be in the developing countries. Aging population may suffer from various physical, cognitive, and social problems, due to aging process such as impairment of physical related functions (decreased mobility and walking speed, falls, frailty, decreased walking speed, difficulties in basic, and instrumental activities of daily living), cognitive related functions (memory-related issues), sensory functions (hearing loss, cataracts and refractive errors, presbyopia, decreased vestibular function), behavioural and psychological disorders, social isolation issues, and poor quality of life. Over the period of the last few decades, emerging technologies such as internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), sensors, cloud computing, wireless communication technologies, and assistive robotics have given the vision to develop various ambient or active assisted living (AAL) approaches for supporting an elderly people to live safely and independently in their living environment and participate in their daily and community activities, as well as supporting them to maintain their physical, mental health, and quality of their life. The aim of this paper is to review the use of Ambient or Active Assisted Living for older adults with physical, cognitive impairments, and their social participation.", "To evaluate the effect of elevated maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) on intelligence and growth of singletons after in\u00a0vitro fertilization (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).\nCohort study.\nUniversity hospital.\nSingletons born to infertile couples who underwent an autologous IVF/ICSI cycle from 2002 to 2012 and were followed up with at the age of 3-6\u00a0years from 2009 to\u00a02017.\nWe compared the health of offspring born to overweight/obese women and normal weight women through assisted reproductive technology (ART).\nAge- and sex-specific BMI z-scores, verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ), performance intelligence quotient (PIQ), and full intelligence quotient (FIQ).\nAfter adjusting for confounders, obese women were more likely than normal-BMI women to have obese children (20.0% vs. 5.1%), and overweight women had increased risks of having overweight children (13.6% vs. 8.2%) or obese children (10.1% vs. 5.1%) compared with normal-BMI women. Maternal prepregnancy BMI had a weakly negative effect on estimated IQ of children, but after adjusting for parental educational level, the IQ scores of offspring were similar between groups. However, after adjusting for confounders, offspring of obese women showed increased prevalence of intellectual disability (IQ <80) in VIQ (16.9% vs. 8.5%) and FIQ (10.8% vs. 3.9%) compared with normal-BMI women.\nMaternal prepregnancy obesity is associated with increased risks for obesity and overweight at early ages in offspring conceived through IVF/ICSI and may also affect the risk of intellectual disability of offspring. Overall, we suggest that weight management is essential for women before entering an IVF/ICSI cycle for ensuring long-term child health.", "Rising concerns about the short- and long-term detrimental consequences of administration of conventional pharmacopeia are fueling the search for alternative, complementary, personalized, and comprehensive approaches to human healthcare. Qigong, a form of Traditional Chinese Medicine, represents a viable alternative approach. Here, we started with the practical, philosophical, and psychological background of Ki (in Japanese) or Qi (in Chinese) and their relationship to Qigong theory and clinical application. Noting the drawbacks of the current state of Qigong clinic, herein we propose that to manage the unique aspects of the Eastern 'non-linearity' and 'holistic' approach, it needs to be integrated with the Western \"linearity\" \"one-direction\" approach. This is done through developing the concepts of \"Qigong breathing signatures,\" which can define our life breathing patterns associated with diseases using machine learning technology. We predict that this can be achieved by establishing an artificial intelligence (AI)-Medicine training camp of databases, which will integrate Qigong-like breathing patterns with different pathologies unique to individuals. Such an integrated connection will allow the AI-Medicine algorithm to identify breathing patterns and guide medical intervention. This unique view of potentially connecting Eastern Medicine and Western Technology can further add a novel insight to our current understanding of both Western and Eastern medicine, thereby establishing a vitality score index (VSI) that can predict the outcomes of lifestyle behaviors and medical conditions.", "The use of pollen as a forensic tool for geolocation is a well-established practice worldwide in cases ranging from the provenance of drugs and other illicit materials to tracking the travel of individuals in criminal investigations. Here we propose a novel approach to generation of pollen databases that uses pollen vacuumed from mammal pelts collected historically from international areas that are now deemed too high risk to visit. We present the results of a study we conducted using mammal pelts collected from Mexico. This new investigative technique is important because, although it would seem that the ubiquitous and geo-specific nature of pollen would make pollen analysis among the most promising forensic tools for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, it is not the case. The process is notoriously slow because pollen identification is a tedious task requiring trained specialists (palynologists) who are few in number worldwide, and the reference materials necessary for geolocation usually are rare or absent, especially from regions of the world that are no longer safe to visit because of war or threat of terrorism. Current forensic palynological work is carried out by a few highly trained palynologists who require accurate databases of pollen distribution, especially from sensitive areas, to do their jobs accurately and efficiently. Our project shows the suitability of using the untapped museum pelt resources to support homeland security programs. This first palynological study using museum pelts yielded 133 different pollen and spore types, including 8 moss or fern families, 12 gymnosperm genera and 112 angiosperm species. We show that the palynological print from each region is statistically different with some important clustering, demonstrating the potential to use this technique for geolocation.", "The relation between visual processing speed (critical flicker fusion thresholds [CFF] and psychomotor reaction time) and higher-level cognitive function was assessed using a cross-sectional sample (n\u2009=\u200951) of 7 to 13-year-old preadolescent children. Data on visual processing speed (CFF and psychomotor reaction time) and cognitive function (Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Abilities) were collected. Woodcock-Johnson III composite standard scores (brief intellectual ability [BIA], cognitive efficiency, processing speed, and executive processes) were calculated to control for age in the cognitive variables. CFF was related to cognitive efficiency, r(46) = 0.26, p\u2009=\u20090.036, and executive processes, r(44) = 0.25, p\u2009=\u20090.05, and showed a trend toward relating to processing speed, r(46) = 0.19, p\u2009=\u20090.09. Both psychomotor reaction time measures (fixed and variable) were related to executive processes and global intelligence (BIA) such that higher cognitive scores were associated with shorter reaction times, rs ranged from -0.25 to -0.29, ps < 0.05. In addition, fixed reaction time was related to cognitive efficiency, r(47) = -0.26, p\u2009<\u20090.05. The small nature of many of these relations suggests that visual processing speed is only one of many possible influences on the higher cognitive function of children.", "The efficient use of testing resources is crucial in the fight against doping in sports. The athlete biological passport relies on the need to identify the right athletes to test, and the right time to test them. Here we present an approach to longitudinal tracking of athlete performance to provide an additional, more intelligence-led approach to improve targeted antidoping testing. The performance results of athletes (male shot putters, male 100 m sprinters, and female 800 m runners) were obtained from a performance results database. Standardized performances, which adjust for average career performance, were calculated to determine the volatility in performance over an athlete's career. We then used a Bayesian spline model to statistically analyse changes within an athlete's standardized performance over the course of a career both for athletes who were presumed \"clean\" (not doped), and those previously convicted of doping offences. We used the model to investigate changes in the slope of each athlete's career performance trajectory and whether these changes can be linked to doping status. The model was able to identify differences in the standardized performance of clean and doped athletes, with the sign of the change able to provide some discrimination. Consistent patterns of standardized performance profile are seen across shot put, 100 m and 800 m for both the clean and doped athletes we investigated. This study demonstrates the potential for modeling athlete performance data to distinguish between the career trajectories of clean and doped athletes, and to enable the risk stratification of athletes on their risk of doping.", "Neither neurobiological nor process models of meaning composition specify the operator through which constituent parts are bound together into compositional structures. In this paper, we argue that a neurophysiological computation system cannot achieve the compositionality exhibited in human thought and language if it were to rely on a multiplicative operator to perform binding, as the tensor product (TP)-based systems that have been widely adopted in cognitive science, neuroscience and artificial intelligence do. We show via simulation and two behavioural experiments that TPs violate variable-value independence, but human behaviour does not. Specifically, TPs fail to capture that in the statements fuzzy cactus and fuzzy penguin, both cactus and penguin are predicated by fuzzy(x) and belong to the set of fuzzy things, rendering these arguments similar to each other. Consistent with that thesis, people judged arguments that shared the same role to be similar, even when those arguments themselves (e.g., cacti and penguins) were judged to be dissimilar when in isolation. By contrast, the similarity of the TPs representing fuzzy(cactus) and fuzzy(penguin) was determined by the similarity of the arguments, which in this case approaches zero. Based on these results, we argue that neural systems that use TPs for binding cannot approximate how the human mind and brain represent compositional information during processing. We describe a contrasting binding mechanism that any physiological or artificial neural system could use to maintain independence between a role and its argument, a prerequisite for compositionality and, thus, for instantiating the expressive power of human thought and language in a neural system. This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards mechanistic models of meaning composition'.", "The Mini-Mental Examination for Children (MMC) is a widely used tool for assessing global cognitive deficits, however,is still unknown whether MMC is sensitive for investigating cognitive profiles associated with learning difficulties (LD).\nHere we investigate the feasibility of using the MMC for screening school-aged children with learning difficulties in spelling and math.\nThe MMC and other neurophysiological tests were administered to a sample of 168 children, aged 7 to 12 years. The sample was subdivided into a Control group and LD group (Math Difficulties, Spelling Difficulties, Math and Spelling Difficulties). Diagnostic accuracy was assessed with ROC analysis. Convergent and divergent validity was assessed using correlation analysis.\nPerformance on the MMC was associated with nonverbal intelligence, age and school achievement. The LD group had significantly lower performance on the MMC than the Control group. Performance on the MMC discriminated LD children with a global accuracy of around 0.80. Associations between the MMC and the other neuropsychological variables were higher for finger gnosis (r=0.40) and generally higher for early elementary school grades. The MMC proved satisfactory for identifying LD children with good accuracy. Nonverbal intelligence, and perceptual/motor abilities play an important role in MMC performance.\nThe MMC could be a useful instrument for screening children with LD.\nMini-exame mental para crian\u00e7as (MMC) \u00e9 uma ferramenta amplamente utilizada para avaliar d\u00e9ficits cognitivos globais, no entanto, ainda \u00e9 desconhecido se a MMC \u00e9 sens\u00edvel para investigar perfis cognitivos associados a dificuldades de aprendizagem.\nAqui n\u00f3s investigamos a viabilidade de usar MMC para triagem de crian\u00e7as em idade escolar com dificuldades de aprendizagem em ortografia e matem\u00e1tica.\nMMC e outros testes neuropsicol\u00f3gicos foram administrados em uma amostra de 168 crian\u00e7as de 7 a 12 anos de idade. A amostra foi subdividida em um Grupo Controle e um grupo LD (dificuldade na matem\u00e1tica, na escrita, ou na escrita e na matem\u00e1tica). A acur\u00e1cia diagn\u00f3stica foi analisada atrav\u00e9s de uma an\u00e1lise de curva ROC.

The goal of this study was to analyze the predictive capacity of aggressiveness (physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility) and emotional intelligence (attention, understanding, and emotional regulation) with respect to being a victim, aggressor or victim-aggressor of cyberbullying during adolescence. The Screening for Peer Bullying, the Aggressiveness Questionnaire and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 were administered to a sample of 1102 Spanish secondary education students, aged 12 to 18. In general, results revealed a higher probability of being a victim, aggressor or victim-aggressor as physical aggressiveness and anger increased. On the other hand, results revealed a low probability of being a victim, aggressor or victim-aggressor as emotional understanding and emotional regulation increased. These findings highlight the importance of considering said variables when creating prevention programs to stop or reduce the social and educational issue of cyberbullying during adolescence.", "Caffeine is widely used to counteract the effects of sleep loss. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the impact of acute caffeine consumption on cognitive, physical, occupational and driving performance in sleep deprived/restricted individuals. 45 publications providing 327 effect estimates (EEs) were included in the review. Caffeine improved response time (44 EEs; g = 0.86; 95 % CI: 0.53-0.83) and accuracy (27 EEs; g = 0.68; 95 % CI: 0.48-0.88) on attention tests, improved executive function (38 EEs; g = 0.35; 95 % CI: 0.15-0.55), improved reaction time (12 EEs; g = 1.11; 95 % CI: 0.75-1.47), improved response time (20 EEs; g = 1.95; 95 % CI: 1.39-2.52) and accuracy (34 EEs; g = 0.43; 95 % CI: 0.30-0.55) on information processing tasks, and enhanced lateral (29 EEs; g = 1.67; 95 % CI: 1.32-2.02) and longitudinal (12 EEs; g = 1.60; 95 % CI: 1.16-2.03) measures of vehicular control on driving tests. Studies also typically indicated benefit of caffeine on memory (25 EEs), crystallized intelligence (11 EEs), physical (39 EEs) and occupational (36 EEs) performance. Ingestion of caffeine is an effective counter-measure to the cognitive and physical impairments associated with sleep loss.", "To establish whether the appearance of malocclusion affected dating prospects. The secondary objective was to identify any significant predictors relating to likelihood of dating.\nCross-sectional study.\nKing's College London.\nA total of 232 undergraduate students.\nParticipants were shown images of either one man or one woman. The images had been manipulated using computer software to represent one of three differing dental appearances: post-orthodontic aligned teeth; pre-orthodontic crowded teeth; or pre-orthodontic missing teeth (developmentally absent maxillary lateral incisors). Sealed envelopes were randomly assigned to participants, who rated the individual in the image in relation to: attractiveness; intelligence; happiness; nervousness; and how much they would want to go on a date with them. The response format was a 100-mm visual analogue scale.\nThe aligned dental appearance received statistically significant higher ratings of attractiveness (P < 0.001), intelligence (P = 0.031), likelihood of dating (P = 0.017) as well as lower ratings of nervousness (P = 0.020). There was no statistically significant difference in relation to happiness (P = 0.43), neither were there any statistically significant differences between the crowded and missing dental appearances. Regression analysis revealed that rated attractiveness was the most significant predictor in relation to likelihood of dating (P < 0.001).\nMalocclusion did influence dating prospects. Photographs of individuals with aligned teeth were more likely to be rated highly in relation to attractiveness, intelligence and likelihood of dating, when compared with images of malocclusions. The most significant predictor of likelihood of dating was rated attractiveness.", "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are highly prevalent, and frequently comorbid, among active and retired military service members. Both TBI and PTSD may contribute to impaired cognitive function, but it remains insufficiently clear what the relative impact of each is on overall cognition and whether multiple TBIs may further impair cognitive function. To understand the relative impact of TBI and symptoms of PTSD on cognitive function we examined data from 326 active or retired military service members, or dependents, either with or without a history of TBI, using questionnaires and the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIH-TB), a brief iPad-based assessment that measures the cognitive domains most important to daily functioning. The NIH-TB was developed for use as a \"common currency\" among research studies, and was more recently adapted to the iPad for ease of use. To our knowledge, this is the first report of its application to evaluate the relative impact of TBI and PTSD. Our results indicate that cognitive function remains largely intact after multiple TBIs if symptoms of PTSD are not evident, and that measures of literacy and overall intelligence are relatively impervious to both TBI and PTSD. When cognitive impairment is observed after TBI, it is predominantly associated with the presence of significant symptoms of PTSD in most domains. However, TBI alone may impair some aspects of executive function. These findings need to be validated in other populations.", "Recent advances in artificial intelligence along with the development of large data sets of energies calculated using quantum mechanical (QM)/density functional theory (DFT) methods have enabled prediction of accurate molecular energies at reasonably low computational cost. However, machine learning models that have been reported so far require the atomic positions obtained from geometry optimizations using high-level QM/DFT methods as input in order to predict the energies and do not allow for geometry optimization. In this study, a transferable and molecule size-independent machine learning model bonds (B), angles (A), nonbonded (N) interactions, and dihedrals (D) neural network (BAND NN) based on a chemically intuitive representation inspired by molecular mechanics force fields is presented. The model predicts the atomization energies of equilibrium and nonequilibrium structures as sum of energy contributions from bonds (B), angles (A), nonbonds (N), and dihedrals (D) at remarkable accuracy. The robustness of the proposed model is further validated by calculations that span over the conformational, configurational, and reaction space. The transferability of this model on systems larger than the ones in the data set is demonstrated by performing calculations on selected large molecules. Importantly, employing the BAND NN model, it is possible to perform geometry optimizations starting from nonequilibrium structures along with predicting their energies. \u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "Recently, carbon dioxide capture and conversion, along with hydrogen from renewable resources, provide an alternative approach to synthesis of useful fuels and chemicals. People are increasingly interested in developing innovative carbon dioxide hydrogenation catalysts, and the pace of progress in this area is accelerating. Accordingly, this perspective presents current state of the art and outlook in synthesis of light olefins, dimethyl ether, liquid fuels, and alcohols through two leading hydrogenation mechanisms: methanol reaction and Fischer-Tropsch based carbon dioxide hydrogenation. The future research directions for developing new heterogeneous catalysts with transformational technologies, including 3D printing and artificial intelligence, are provided.", "Socioeconomic position (SEP) is a multi-dimensional construct reflecting (and influencing) multiple socio-cultural, physical, and environmental factors. In a sample of 286,301 participants from UK Biobank, we identify 30\u00a0(29 previously\u00a0unreported) independent-loci associated with income. Using a method to meta-analyze data from genetically-correlated traits, we identify an additional 120 income-associated loci. These loci show clear evidence of functionality, with transcriptional differences identified across multiple cortical tissues, and links to GABAergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. By combining our genome wide association study\u00a0on income with data from eQTL studies and chromatin interactions, 24 genes are prioritized for follow up, 18 of which were previously associated with intelligence. We identify intelligence as one of the likely causal, partly-heritable phenotypes that might bridge the gap between molecular genetic inheritance and phenotypic consequence in terms of income differences. These results indicate that, in modern era\u00a0Great Britain, genetic effects contribute towards some of the observed socioeconomic inequalities.", "Significant resources have been spent in collecting and storing large and heterogeneous radar datasets during expensive Arctic and Antarctic fieldwork. The vast majority of data available is unlabeled, and the labeling process is both time-consuming and expensive. One possible alternative to the labeling process is the use of synthetically generated data with artificial intelligence. Instead of labeling real images, we can generate synthetic data based on arbitrary labels. In this way, training data can be quickly augmented with additional images. In this research, we evaluated the performance of synthetically generated radar images based on modified cycle-consistent adversarial networks. We conducted several experiments to test the quality of the generated radar imagery. We also tested the quality of a state-of-the-art contour detection algorithm on synthetic data and different combinations of real and synthetic data. Our experiments show that synthetic radar images generated by generative adversarial network (GAN) can be used in combination with real images for data augmentation and training of deep neural networks. However, the synthetic images generated by GANs cannot be used solely for training a neural network (training on synthetic and testing on real) as they cannot simulate all of the radar characteristics such as noise or Doppler effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in creating radar sounder imagery based on generative adversarial network.", "Artificial intelligence is a hot topic in medical imaging. The development of deep learning methods and in particular the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have led to substantial performance gain over the classic machine learning techniques. Multiple usages are currently being evaluated, especially for thoracic imaging, such as such as lung nodule evaluation, tuberculosis or pneumonia detection or quantification of diffuse lung diseases. Chest radiography is a near perfect domain for the development of deep learning algorithms for automatic interpretation, requiring large annotated datasets, in view of the high number of procedures and increasing data availability. Current algorithms are able to detect up to 14 common anomalies, when present as isolated findings. Chest computed tomography is another major field of application for artificial intelligence, especially in the perspective of large scale lung cancer screening. It is important for radiologists to apprehend, contribute actively and lead this new era of radiology powered by artificial intelligence. Such a perspective requires understanding new terms and concepts associated with machine learning. The objective of this paper is to provide useful definitions for understanding the methods used and their possibilities, and report current and future developments for thoracic imaging. Prospective validation of AI tools will be required before reaching routine clinical implementation.", "An application of artificial intelligence to screen for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) after coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) test.\nAs an initial step we analyzed a group of 435 patients (23% male, mean age 61 \u00b1 10) with low to moderate probability of CAD, who underwent clinically indicated CACS and coronary computed tomography angiography. Based on those data we elaborated a gradient boosting machine (GBM) model for prediction of obstructive CAD. Later the model was evaluated on a control group of 126 consecutive patients (31% male, mean age 59 \u00b1 10).\nStratified 10-fold cross-validation performed on the group of 435 patients demonstrated the GBM model's sensitivity at 100 \u00b1 0% and specificity at 69.8 \u00b1 3.6%, while the outcomes (confusion matrix) of a clinical application on the group of 126 patients were: 73 true negative, 0 false negative, 20 true positive, and 33 false positive.\nThe GBM algorithm showcased a considerably high discriminatory power for excluding the presence of obstructive CAD, with negative predictive value and positive predictive value of 100% and 38%, respectively.", "Metabolic engineering aims to produce chemicals of interest from living organisms, to advance toward greener chemistry. Despite efforts, the research and development process is still long and costly, and efficient computational design tools are required to explore the chemical biosynthetic space. Here, we propose to explore the bioretrosynthesis space using an artificial intelligence based approach relying on the Monte Carlo Tree Search reinforcement learning method, guided by chemical similarity. We implement this method in RetroPath RL, an open-source and modular command line tool. We validate it on a golden data set of 20 manually curated experimental pathways as well as on a larger data set of 152 successful metabolic engineering projects. Moreover, we provide a novel feature that suggests potential media supplements to complement the enzymatic synthesis plan.", "As a promising method in artificial intelligence, deep learning has been proven successful in several domains ranging from acoustics and images to natural language processing. With medical imaging becoming an important part of disease screening and diagnosis, deep learning-based approaches have emerged as powerful techniques in medical image areas. In this process, feature representations are learned directly and automatically from data, leading to remarkable breakthroughs in the medical field. Deep learning has been widely applied in medical imaging for improved image analysis. This paper reviews the major deep learning techniques in this time of rapid evolution and summarizes some of its key contributions and state-of-the-art outcomes. The topics include classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on medical image analysis with respect to pulmonary medical images, datasets, and benchmarks. A comprehensive overview of these methods implemented on various lung diseases consisting of pulmonary nodule diseases, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and interstitial lung disease is also provided. Lastly, the application of deep learning techniques to the medical image and an analysis of their future challenges and potential directions are discussed.", "Deep learning has shown remarkable results for image analysis and is expected to aid individual treatment decisions in health care. Treatment recommendations are predictions with an inherently causal interpretation. To use deep learning for these applications in the setting of observational data, deep learning methods must be made compatible with the required causal assumptions. We present a scenario with real-world medical images (CT-scans of lung cancer) and simulated outcome data. Through the data simulation scheme, the images contain two distinct factors of variation that are associated with survival, but represent a collider (tumor size) and a prognostic factor (tumor heterogeneity), respectively. When a deep network would use all the information available in the image to predict survival, it would condition on the collider and thereby introduce bias in the estimation of the treatment effect. We show that when this collider can be quantified, unbiased individual prognosis predictions are attainable with deep learning. This is achieved by (1) setting a dual task for the network to predict both the outcome and the collider and (2) enforcing a form of linear independence of the activation distributions of the last layer. Our method provides an example of combining deep learning and structural causal models to achieve unbiased individual prognosis predictions. Extensions of machine learning methods for applications to causal questions are required to attain the long-standing goal of personalized medicine supported by artificial intelligence.", "As we enter the era of \"big data,\" an increasing amount of complex health-care data will become available. These data are often redundant, \"noisy,\" and characterized by wide variability. In order to offer a precise and transversal view of a clinical scenario the artificial intelligence (AI) with machine learning (ML) algorithms and Artificial neuron networks (ANNs) process were adopted, with a promising wide diffusion in the near future. The present work aims to provide a comprehensive and critical overview of the current and potential applications of AI and ANNs in urology.\nA non-systematic review of the literature was performed by screening Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Database, and Embase to detect pertinent studies regarding the application of AI and ANN in Urology.\nThe main application of AI in urology is the field of genitourinary cancers. Focusing on prostate cancer, AI was applied for the prediction of prostate biopsy results. For bladder cancer, the prediction of recurrence-free probability and diagnostic evaluation were analysed with ML algorithms. For kidney and testis cancer, anecdotal experiences were reported for staging and prediction of diseases recurrence. More recently, AI has been applied in non-oncological diseases like stones and functional urology.\nAI technologies are growing their role in health care; but, up to now, their \"real-life\" implementation remains limited. However, in the near future, the potential of AI-driven era could change the clinical practice in Urology, improving overall patient outcomes.", "We aimed to describe school-entry age neurocognitive, functional, and HRQL outcomes and their predictors after liver transplant done at age <6\u00a0years.\nA prospective cohort of all (n\u00a0=\u00a069) children surviving liver transplant from 1999 to 2014 were assessed at age 55.4 (SD 7.2) months and 38.6 (12.4) months after transplant. Assessment included: the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence, Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of VMI, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System caregiver-completed questionnaire, and PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales. Univariate and multiple linear regression determined predictors of outcomes at P\u00a0<\u00a0.05.\nNeurocognitive and functional outcomes were on average within 1\u00a0SD of population norms, although shifted to the left (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.03), with more patients than expected having scores >2 (3.7-5.9 times more, P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.007) SD below population norms. Total and Summary HRQL scores were statistically significantly lower than the healthy normative population (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.02) and a congenital heart disease group (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.02), but similar to children with other chronic health conditions; differences often exceeded the MCID and were lowest in the School functioning domain. There were few predictors on multiple linear regressions, and we could not confirm previous studies that suggested various inconsistent predictors of outcomes. Neurocognitive and functional outcomes scores were highly correlated with HRQL scores except for the School functioning domain, but did not fully explain them.\nLong-term follow-up of this vulnerable population is important in order to facilitate support for the patient and family, and early intervention for any difficulties identified.", "The excess risk of violence in psychotic disorders may partly be explained by impairments in executive functions (EFs) and theory of mind (ToM). However, previous studies have been limited by composite measures of EFs and small samples of inpatients.\nData were collected for the research project Genetic Risk and Outcome of Psychosis (GROUP). Patients with psychotic disorders (N\u202f=\u202f891) were recruited from various care settings in the Netherlands. The following neuropsychological tests were administered (targeted cognitive function in parentheses): (i) Continuous Performance Test-HQ (inhibition); (ii) Response Shifting Task (cognitive flexibility); (iii) Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III) Block Design subtest (fluid intelligence); (iv) Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) Mazes Test (planning); (v) Degraded Facial Affect Recognition Task (affective ToM); and (vi) Hinting Task (cognitive ToM). Lifetime violence was ascertained from medical records and patient interviews. We used analysis of covariance to compare the mean scores of violent and nonviolent patients on each test, adjusting for age and sex.\nViolent patients performed significantly worse than nonviolent patients on the WAIS-III Block Design subtest (F [1, 847]\u202f=\u202f5.12, p\u202f=\u202f.024), NAB Mazes Test (F [1, 499]\u202f=\u202f5.32, p\u202f=\u202f.022) and Hinting Task (F [1, 839]\u202f=\u202f9.38, p\u202f=\u202f.002). For the other tests, the between-group differences were nonsignificant. Violent behavior explained no more than 1% of the variance in performance on each test.\nImpairments in EFs and ToM are unlikely to provide useful targets for risk assessment and interventions.", "Aim: Explore if dexmedetomidine (DEX)\u00a0improves neurodevelopment and cognitive impairment in infants with congenital heart disease. Materials & methods: We retrospectively analyzed 256 pediatric patients aged less than 2 years with heart disease undergoing thoracic surgery. The intelligence quotient and neurodevelopment were tested. Mortality, incidence of postoperation adverse events, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of stay were recorded and compared. Results: Compared with those not administered DEX, intelligence quotient scores and neurodevelopment evaluation scores increased in patients receiving perioperative DEX. There were no significant differences in mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation or length of stay. Conclusion: The administration of DEX might improve neural development and reduce the adverse effects of general anesthesia in infants with congenital heart disease undergoing surgery and extracorporeal circulation.", "Three aspects of cognition (fluid intelligence, executive functioning, and crystallized intelligence) in pre-K were examined as predictors of math and reading achievement in kindergarten among an economically diverse sample of 198 African American children. From a variable-centered perspective, confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the three aspects of cognition can be distinguished. Subsequent regression analyses indicated that only executive functioning and crystallized intelligence predicted math and reading achievement in kindergarten. From a person-centered perspective, three profiles of cognition were identified: low fluid and crystallized intelligence with average executive functioning, average abilities in all three areas, and high abilities in all three areas, but particularly higher in executive functioning. Children with low fluid and crystallized intelligence during pre-K had the lowest math and reading skills in kindergarten, whereas children with the highest cognitive skills had the highest math and reading skills in kindergarten. Together, the variable-centered and person-centered results suggest that perhaps there should be increased focus on crystallized intelligence in early education programs, policies, and interventions in addition to a focus on executive functioning.", "Previous epidemiologic studies have reported adverse neurodevelopmental sequelae following prenatal infectious exposure, yet long-term effects estimated from these observational studies are often subject to biases due to confounding and loss to follow-up.\nWe demonstrate the joint use of inverse probability (IP) treatment and censoring weights when evaluating neurotoxic effects of prenatal bacterial infection.\nWe applied IP weighting for both treatment and censoring to estimate the effects of maternal bacterial infection during pregnancy on mean intelligence quotient (IQ) scores measured at age 7 using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Participants were members of a population-based pregnancy cohort recruited in the Boston and Providence sites of the Collaborative Perinatal Project between 1959 and 1966 (n\u00a0=\u00a011\u00a0984). We calculated average treatment effects (ATE) and average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) using IP weights estimated via generalized boosted models.\nATE- and ATT-weighted mean IQ scores were lowest among offspring exposed to multi-systemic bacterial infection during pregnancy and highest for those unexposed. The effects of prenatal bacterial infection were greater among male offspring, particularly on performance IQ scores. Offspring who were exposed to multi-systemic bacterial infection in the third trimester displayed the largest reduction in mean full-scale, verbal, and performance IQ scores at age 7 compared to those unexposed or exposed in earlier trimesters.\nWe find that prenatal bacterial infection is associated with cognitive impairments at age 7. Associations are strongest for more severe infections, that occur in the third trimester, and among males. Public health intervention targeting bacterial infection in pregnant women may help enhance the cognitive development of offspring.", "Schools and universities devote considerable time and resources to developing students' social and emotional skills, such as emotional intelligence (EI). The goals of such programs are partly for personal development but partly to increase academic performance. The current meta-analysis examines the degree to which student EI is associated with academic performance. We found an overall effect of \u03c1 = .20 using robust variance estimation (N = 42,529, k = 1,246 from 158 citations). The association is significantly stronger for ability EI (\u03c1 = .24, k = 50) compared with self-rated (\u03c1 = .12, k = 33) or mixed EI (\u03c1 = .19, k = 90). Ability, self-rated, and mixed EI explained an additional 1.7%, 0.7%, and 2.3% of the variance, respectively, after controlling for intelligence and big five personality. Understanding and management branches of ability EI explained an additional 3.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Relative importance analysis suggests that EI is the third most important predictor for all three streams, after intelligence and conscientiousness. Moderators of the effect differed across the three EI streams. Ability EI was a stronger predictor of performance in humanities than science. Self-rated EI was a stronger predictor of grades than standardized test scores. We propose that three mechanisms underlie the EI/academic performance link: (a) regulating academic emotions, (b) building social relationships at school, and (c) academic content overlap with EI. Different streams of EI may affect performance through different mechanisms. We note some limitations, including the lack of evidence for a causal direction.

Machine learning is gradually growing and becoming a critical approach in many domains such as health, education, and business.\nIn this paper, we applied machine learning to the diabetes dataset with the aim of recognizing patterns and combinations of factors that characterizes or explain re-admission among diabetes patients. The classifiers used include Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor, Na\u00efve Bayes, J48 and Support vector machine.\nOf the 100,000 cases, 78,363 were diabetic and over 47% were readmitted.Based on the classes that models produced, diabetic patients who are more likely to be readmitted are either women, or Caucasians, or outpatients, or those who undergo less rigorous lab procedures, treatment procedures, or those who receive less medication, and are thus discharged without proper improvements or administration of insulin despite having been tested positive for HbA1c.\nDiabetic patients who do not undergo vigorous lab assessments, diagnosis, medications are more likely to be readmitted when discharged without improvements and without receiving insulin administration, especially if they are women, Caucasians, or both.", "The filter bubble is an intermediate structure to provoke polarization and echo chambers in social networks, and it has become one of today's most urgent issues for social media. Previous studies usually equated filter bubbles with community structures and emphasized this exogenous isolation effect, but there is a lack of full discussion of the internal organization of filter bubbles. Here, we design an experiment for analysing filter bubbles taking advantage of social bots. We deployed 128 bots to Weibo (the largest microblogging network in China), and each bot consumed a specific topic (entertainment or sci-tech) and ran for at least two months. In total, we recorded about 1.3 million messages exposed to these bots and their social networks. By analysing the text received by the bots and motifs in their social networks, we found that a filter bubble is not only a dense community of users with the same preferences but also presents an endogenetic unidirectional star-like structure. The structure could spontaneously exclude non-preferred information and cause polarization. Moreover, our work proved that the felicitous use of artificial intelligence technology could provide a useful experimental approach that combines privacy protection and controllability in studying social media.", "In recent years, cases of child-to-parent violence (CPV) have increased significantly, prompting greater scientific interest in clarifying its causes. The aim of this research was to study the relationship between styles of family communication (open, offensive and avoidant), emotional intelligence or EI (attention, repair and perceived emotional clarity) and CPV, taking into account the gender of the aggressors. The participants of the study were 1200 adolescents (46.86% boys) between the ages of 12 and 18 enrolled at secondary schools in the Autonomous Communities of Andalusia and Valencia (M = 13.88, SD = 1.32). A Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA, 3 \u00d7 2) was performed with CPV and gender as independent variables and family communication styles and EI as dependent variables. The results showed that the adolescents with low CPV obtained lower scores for offensive and avoidant family communication and higher scores for both positive family communication and emotional repair. The girls scored higher than the boys in both offensive communication and perceived emotional attention. The results highlight the importance of encouraging positive communication, as well as the need to strengthen perceived emotional repair to prevent future cases of CPV.", "To our knowledge, no research project on alexithymia has been conducted in Lebanon. The objective of this study was to assess risk factors associated with alexithymia in a representative sample of the Lebanese population.\nThis is a cross-sectional study, conducted between November 2017 and March 2018, which enrolled 789 participants from al districts of Lebanon. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) was used to measure alexithymia, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test to assess alcohol use, drinking patterns, and alcohol-related issues, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale to evaluate self-worth, the Hamilton depression rating scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale to screen for depression and anxiety respectively, the Three-Dimensional Work Fatigue Inventory to measure physical, mental and emotional work fatigue respectively, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale to evaluate suicidal ideation and behavior, the Perceived Stress Scale to measure stress, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale to help identify a social anxiety disorder and the Quick Emotional Intelligence Self-Assessment to measure emotional intelligence.\nThe results showed that 395 (50.4%) were not alexithymic, 226 (28.8%) were possible alexithymic, whereas 163 (20.8%) were alexithymic according to established clinical cutoffs. Stress (Beta\u2009=\u20090.456), emotional exhaustion (Beta\u2009=\u20090.249), the AUDIT score (Beta\u2009=\u20090.225) and anxiety (Beta\u2009=\u20090.096) were associated with higher alexithymia, whereas low emotional work fatigue (Beta\u2009=\u2009-0.114) and being married (Beta\u2009=\u2009-1.933) were associated with lower alexithymia. People in distress (Beta\u2009=\u20097.33) was associated with higher alexithymia scores, whereas people with high wellbeing (Beta\u2009=\u2009-2.18), an intermediate (Beta\u2009=\u2009-2.90) and a high (Beta\u2009=\u2009-2.71) family monthly income were associated with lower alexithymia compared to a low one.\nAlexithymia appears to be influenced by many factors, including stress, anxiety, and burnout. To reduce its prevalence, it is important that health professionals educate the public about these factors. Further studies on a larger scale are needed to confirm our findings.", "Accurate identification of bone surface modifications (BSM) is crucial for the taphonomic understanding of archaeological and paleontological sites. Critical interpretations of when humans started eating meat and animal fat or when they started using stone tools, or when they occupied new continents or interacted with predatory guilds impinge on accurate identifications of BSM. Until now, interpretations of Plio-Pleistocene BSM have been contentious because of the high uncertainty in discriminating among taphonomic agents. Recently, the use of machine learning algorithms has yielded high accuracy in the identification of BSM. A branch of machine learning methods based on imaging, computer vision (CV), has opened the door to a more objective and accurate method of BSM identification. The present work has selected two extremely similar types of BSM (cut marks made on fleshed an defleshed bones) to test the immense potential of artificial intelligence methods. This CV approach not only produced the highest accuracy in the classification of these types of BSM until present (95% on complete images of BSM and 88.89% of images of only internal mark features), but it also has enabled a method for determining which inconspicuous microscopic features determine successful BSM discrimination. The potential of this method in other areas of taphonomy and paleobiology is enormous.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used in the field of radiology. The aim of this review is to illustrate the developments expected in the next 5 to 10 years as well as possible advantages and risks.\nCurrently, all computed tomography (CT) images are reconstructed using programmed algorithms. Pathologies are detected by the radiologist with a high expenditure of time and evaluated using standardized procedures.\nAI\u00a0can potentially provide a significant improvement to all these standard procedures in the future. CT reconstructions can be significantly enhanced using generative adversarial networks (GAN). Histology can be evaluated using radiomics or deep learning (DL)-based image analysis and the prognosis of the patient can be predicted highly individualized.\nThe performance of the networks is strongly influenced by data quality and requires extensive validation. The ability and willingness of the manufacturers to integrate these into the existing RIS/PACS systems is also decisive.\nAI will have a large impact on the daily clinical work of radiologists. However, publications on the risks of the technology and on adequate validation are still lacking. In addition to opening new fields of application, further research regarding possible risks is warranted.\nIn the next 5 to 10 years, AI will improve and facilitate work in clinical practice. The integration of the applications into the existing RIS/PACS systems is expected to take place via app stores and/or existing teleradiology networks.", "Update findings regarding polypharmacy among people with HIV (PWH) and consider what research is most needed.\nAmong PWH, polypharmacy is common, occurs in middle age, and is predominantly driven by nonantiretroviral (ARV) medications. Many studies have demonstrated strong associations between polypharmacy and receipt of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMS), but few have considered actual adverse events. Falls, delirium, pneumonia, hospitalization, and mortality are associated with polypharmacy among PWH and risks remain after adjustment for severity of illness.\nPolypharmacy is a growing problem and mechanisms of injury likely include potentially inappropriate medications, total drug burden, known pairwise drug interactions, higher level drug interactions, drug--gene interactions, and drug--substance use interactions (alcohol, extra-medical prescription medication, and drug use). Before we can effectively design interventions, we need to use observational data to gain a better understanding of the modifiable mechanisms of injury. As sicker individuals take more medications, analyses must account for severity of illness. As self-report of substance use may be inaccurate, direct biomarkers, such as phosphatidylethanol (PEth) for alcohol are needed. Large samples including electronic health records, genetics, accurate measures of substance use, and state of the art statistical and artificial intelligence techniques are needed to advance our understanding and inform clinical management of polypharmacy in PWH.", "Recent large-scale, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic loci associated with general intelligence. The cumulative influence of these loci on brain structure is unknown. We examined if cortical morphology mediates the relationship between GWAS-derived polygenic scores for intelligence (PSi) and g-factor. Using the effect sizes from one of the largest GWAS meta-analysis on general intelligence to date, PSi were calculated among 10 P value thresholds. PSi were assessed for the association with g-factor performance, cortical thickness (CT), and surface area (SA) in two large imaging-genetics samples (IMAGEN N\u2009=\u20091651; IntegraMooDS N\u2009=\u2009742). PSi explained up to 5.1% of the variance of g-factor in IMAGEN (F1,1640\u2009=\u200912.2-94.3; P\u2009<\u20090.005), and up to 3.0% in IntegraMooDS (F1,725\u2009=\u200910.0-21.0; P\u2009<\u20090.005). The association between polygenic scores and g-factor was partially mediated by SA and CT in prefrontal, anterior cingulate, insula, and medial temporal cortices in both samples (PFWER-corrected\u2009<\u20090.005). The variance explained by mediation was up to 0.75% in IMAGEN and 0.77% in IntegraMooDS. Our results provide evidence that cumulative genetic load influences g-factor via cortical structure. The consistency of our results across samples suggests that cortex morphology could be a novel potential biomarker for neurocognitive dysfunction that is among the most intractable psychiatric symptoms.", "The AUR Academic Radiology and Industry Leaders Roundtable was organized as an open discussion between academic leaders of top US academic radiology departments and industry leaders from top companies that provide equipment and services to radiology, including manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, software developers and electronic medical record (EMR) providers. The format was that of a structured brainstorming session with pre-selected discussion topics. This roundtable was instrumental in widening perspectives and providing insights into the challenges and opportunities for our specialty, such as in the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI).", "It remains uncertain whether people with psychotic disorders experience progressive cognitive decline or normal cognitive aging after first hospitalization. This information is essential for prognostication in clinical settings, deployment of cognitive remediation, and public health policy.\nTo examine long-term cognitive changes in individuals with psychotic disorders and to compare age-related differences in cognitive performance between people with psychotic disorders and matched control individuals (ie, individuals who had never had psychotic disorders).\nThe Suffolk County Mental Health Project is an inception cohort study of first-admission patients with psychosis. Cognitive functioning was assessed 2 and 20 years later. Patients were recruited from the 12 inpatient facilities of Suffolk County, New York. At year 20, the control group was recruited by random digit dialing and matched to the clinical cohort on zip code and demographics. Data were collected between September 1991 and July 2015. Analysis began January 2016.\nChange in cognitive functioning in 6 domains: verbal knowledge (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised vocabulary test), verbal declarative memory (Verbal Paired Associates test I and II), visual declarative memory (Visual Reproduction test I and II), attention and processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test-written and oral; Trail Making Test [TMT]-A), abstraction-executive function (Trenerry Stroop Color Word Test; TMT-B), and verbal fluency (Controlled Oral Word Association Test).\nA total of 705 participants were included in the analyses (mean [SD] age at year 20, 49.4 [10.1] years): 445 individuals (63.1%) had psychotic disorders (211 with schizophrenia spectrum [138 (65%) male]; 164 with affective psychoses [76 (46%) male]; 70 with other psychoses [43 (61%) male]); and 260 individuals (36.9%) in the control group (50.5 [9.0] years; 134 [51.5%] male). Cognition in individuals with a psychotic disorder declined on all but 2 tests (average decline: d\u2009=\u20090.31; range, 0.17-0.54; all P\u2009<\u2009.001). Cognitive declines were associated with worsening vocational functioning (Visual Reproduction test II: r\u2009=\u20090.20; Symbol Digit Modalities Test-written: r\u2009=\u20090.25; Stroop: r\u2009=\u20090.24; P\u2009<\u2009.009) and worsening negative symptoms (avolition: Symbol Digit Modalities Test-written: r\u2009=\u2009-0.24; TMT-A: r\u2009=\u2009-0.21; Stroop: r\u2009=\u2009-0.21; all P\u2009<\u2009.009; inexpressivity: Stroop: r\u2009=\u2009-0.22; P\u2009<\u2009.009). Compared with control individuals, people with psychotic disrders showed age-dependent deficits in verbal knowledge, fluency, and abstraction-executive function (vocabulary: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.32; Controlled Oral Word Association Test: \u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.32; TMT-B: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.23; all P\u2009<\u2009.05), with the largest gap among participants 50 years or older.\nIn individuals with psychotic disorders, most cognitive functions declined over 2 decades after first hospitalization. Observed declines were clinically significant. Some declines were larger than expected due to normal aging, suggesting that cognitive aging in some domains may be accelerated in this population. If confirmed, these findings would highlight cognition as an important target for research and treatment during later phases of psychotic illness.", "Microdeletions encompassing 14q11.2 locus, involving SUPT16H and CHD8, were shown to cause developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders and macrocephaly. Variations leading to CHD8 haploinsufficiency or loss of function were also shown to lead to a similar phenotype. Recently, a 14q11.2 microduplication syndrome, encompassing CHD8 and SUPT16H, has been described, highlighting the importance of a tight control of at least CHD8 gene-dosage for a normal development. There have been only a few reports of 14q11.2 microduplications. Patients showed variable neurodevelopmental issues of variable severity. Breakpoints of the microduplications were non-recurrent, making interpretation of the CNV and determination of their clinical relevance difficult. Here, we report on two patients with 14q11.2 microduplication encompassing CHD8 and SUPT16H, one of whom had normal intelligence. Review of previous reports describing patients with comparable microduplications allowed for a more precise delineation of the condition and widening of the phenotypic spectrum.", "Existing early detection methods that deal with the pre-diagnosis of dementia have been criticised as not being comprehensive as they do not measure certain cognitive functioning domains besides being inaccessible. A more realistic approach is to develop a comprehensive outcome that includes cognitive functioning of dementia, as this will offer a robust and unbiased outcome for an individual. In this research, a mobile screening application for dementia traits called DementiaTest is proposed, which adopts the gold standard assessment criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). DementiaTest is implemented and tested on the Android and IOS stores. More importantly, it collects data from cases and controls using an easy, interactive, and accessible platform. It provides patients and their family with quick pre-diagnostic reports using certain cognitive functioning indicators; these can be utilized by general practitioners (GPs) for referrals for further assessment in cases of positive outcomes. The data gathered using the new application can be analysed using Artificial Intelligence methods to evaluate the performance of the screening to pinpoint early signs of the dementia.", "Prognosticating the course of diseases to inform decision-making is a key component of intensive care medicine. For several applications in medicine, new methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have already outperformed conventional prediction models. Due to their technical characteristics, these methods will present new ethical challenges to the intensivist.\nIn addition to the standards of data stewardship in medicine, the selection of datasets and algorithms to create AI prognostication models must involve extensive scrutiny to avoid biases and, consequently, injustice against individuals or groups of patients. Assessment of these models for compliance with the ethical principles of beneficence and non-maleficence should also include quantification of predictive uncertainty. Respect for patients' autonomy during decision-making requires transparency of the data processing by AI models to explain the predictions derived from these models. Moreover, a system of continuous oversight can help to maintain public trust in this technology. Based on these considerations as well as recent guidelines, we propose a pathway to an ethical implementation of AI-based prognostication. It includes a checklist for new AI models that deals with medical and technical topics as well as patient- and system-centered issues.\nAI models for prognostication will become valuable tools in intensive care. However, they require technical refinement and a careful implementation according to the standards of medical ethics.", "Alcohol and cannabis remain the substances most widely used by adolescents. Better understanding of the dynamic relationship between trajectories of substance use in relation to neuropsychological functioning is needed. The aim of this study was to examine the different impacts of within- and between-person changes in alcohol and cannabis use on neuropsychological functioning over multiple time points.\nHierarchical linear modeling examined the effects of alcohol and cannabis use on neuropsychological functioning over the course of 14 years in a sample of 175 adolescents (aged 12-15 years at baseline).\nTime-specific fluctuations in alcohol use (within-person effect) predicted worse performance across time on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence Block Design subtest (B = -.05, SE = .02, p = .01). Greater mean levels of percent days of cannabis use across time (between-person effect) were associated with an increased contrast score between Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Color Word Inhibition and Color Naming conditions (B = .52, SE = .14, p < .0001) and poorer performance over time on Block Design (B = -.08, SE = .04, p = .03). Neither alcohol and/nor cannabis use over time was associated with performance in the verbal memory and processing speed domains.\nGreater cumulative cannabis use over adolescence may be linked to poorer inhibitory control and visuospatial functioning performance, whereas more proximal increases in alcohol consumption during adolescence may drive alcohol-related performance decrements in visuospatial functioning. Results from this prospective study add to the growing body of literature on the impact of alcohol and cannabis use on cognition from adolescent to young adulthood.", "We aimed to comprehensively examine the association of breast-feeding, types and initial timing of complementary foods with adolescent cognitive development in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 745 adolescents aged 10-12 years who were born to women who participated in a randomised trial of prenatal micronutrient supplementation in rural Western China. An infant feeding index was constructed based on the current WHO recommendations. Full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) was assessed and derived by the fourth edition of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. The duration of exclusive or any breast-feeding was not significantly associated with adolescent cognitive development. Participants who regularly consumed Fe-rich or Fe-fortified foods during 6-23 months of age had higher FSIQ than those who did not (adjusted mean differences 4\u00b725; 95 % CI 1\u00b799, 6\u00b751). For cows'/goats' milk and high protein-based food, the highest FSIQ was found in participants who initially consumed at 10-12 and 7-9 months, respectively. A strong dose-response relationship of the composite infant feeding index was also identified, with participants in the highest tertile of overall feeding quality having 3\u00b703 (95 % CI 1\u00b737, 4\u00b770) points higher FSIQ than those in the lowest tertile. These findings suggest that appropriate infant feeding practices (breast-feeding plus timely introduction of appropriate complementary foods) were associated with significantly improved early adolescent cognitive development scores in rural China. In addition, improvement in Fe-rich or Fe-fortified foods complementary feeding may produce better adolescent cognitive development outcomes.", "The lack of depth cues and haptic feedback makes minimally invasive surgery a cognitive challenge. It is therefore important to know which individuals are expected to perform well in minimally invasive surgery. In cognitive psychology, methods are available with which one can measure different cognitive thinking styles. It is well known that these cognitive styles correlate with many different tasks. We investigated whether this method can also predict performance on a box trainer (L\u00fcbeck Toolbox\u00ae), a device for training laparoscopic surgery. If so, the method might help to select and train those people who will\u00a0most likely develop high skills in minimally invasive surgery.\nThirty medical students and thirty non-medical students performed five laparoscopic surgical tasks on a box trainer. We measured the time required and the errors participants made on each task. Their cognitive style was measured with a method from cognitive psychology that distinguishes between people who think visually, spatially, or verbally. Furthermore, all students completed a subset of a standard intelligence test (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) and three subtests of the German Medical University Admission Test (TMS).\nParticipants with spatial thinking styles performed best on the box trainer. Visual and verbal cognitive styles impeded box trainer performance. Performance on the box trainer could also be predicted by the TMS and IQ scores.\nThe study shows for the first time that a standard method from cognitive psychology can be used to distinguish between different cognitive styles in surgical education and that these different cognitive styles affect performance on a box trainer. Since the correlation between box trainer performance and surgical proficiency is well documented, the method might be an efficient way to reduce errors and to elevate patient safety in laparoscopic surgery.", "The arrival of artificially intelligent systems into the domain of medical imaging has focused attention and sparked much debate on the role and responsibilities of the radiologist. However, discussion about the impact of such technology on the radiographer role is lacking. This paper discusses the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the radiography profession by assessing current workflow and cross-mapping potential areas of AI automation such as procedure planning, image acquisition and processing. We also highlight the opportunities that AI brings including enhancing patient-facing care, increased cross-modality education and working, increased technological expertise and expansion of radiographer responsibility into AI-supported image reporting and auditing roles.", "The reproducible and exhaustive extraction of information from radiological images is a\u00a0central task in the practice of radiology. Dynamic developments in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are introducing new methods for this task. Radiomics is one such method and offers new opportunities and challenges for the future of radiology.\nRadiomics describes the quantitative evaluation, interpretation, and clinical assessment of imaging markers in radiological data. Components of a\u00a0radiomics analysis are data acquisition, data preprocessing, data management, segmentation of regions of interest, computation and selection of imaging markers, as well as the development of a\u00a0radiomics model used for diagnosis and prognosis. This article explains these components and aims at providing an introduction to the field of radiomics while highlighting existing limitations.\nThis article is based on a\u00a0selective literature search with the PubMed search engine.\nEven though radiomics applications have yet to arrive in routine clinical practice, the quantification of radiological data in terms of radiomics is underway and will increase in the future. This holds the potential for lasting change in the discipline of radiology. Through the successful extraction and interpretation of all the information encoded in radiological images the next step in the direction of a\u00a0more personalized, future-oriented form of medicine can be taken.", "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and the leading cause of impaired vision in adults worldwide. Early detection and treatment for DR could improve patient outcomes. Traditional methods of detecting DR include the gold standard Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study seven standard fields fundus photography, ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp biomicroscopy. These modalities can be expensive, difficult to access and require involvement of specialised healthcare professionals. With the development of mobile phone technology, there is a growing interest in their use for DR identification as this approach is potentially more affordable, accessible and easier to use. Smartphones can be employed in a variety of ways for ophthalmoscopy including the use of smartphone camera, various attachments and artificial intelligence for obtaining and grading of retinal images. The aim of this scoping review is to determine the diagnostic test accuracy of various smartphone ophthalmoscopy approaches for detecting DR in diabetic patients.\nWe will perform an electronic search of MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library for literature published from 2000 onwards. Two reviewers will independently analyse studies for eligibility and assess study quality using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data for a 2\u2a092 contingency table will be extracted. If possible, we will pool sensitivity and specificity data using the random-effects model and construct a summary receiver operating characteristic curve. In case of high heterogeneity, we will present the findings narratively. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis will be performed where appropriate.\nThis scoping review aims to provide an overview of smartphone ophthalmoscopy in DR identification. It will present findings on the accuracy of smartphone ophthalmoscopy in detecting DR, identify gaps in the literature and provide recommendations for future research. This review does not require ethical approval as we will not collect primary data.", "Systematic, structured and longitudinal collection of realtime Big Patient Data and the analysis of aggregated diagnostic, therapeutic and therapy response data of onco-hematologic patients leads to the development of nationwide dynamic disease registries providing a platform for medical, health industrial and data science research, hospital and health insurance cost analysis, measurement of innovative diagnostics and therapeutics performance, evaluation of compassion-based treatments and general support for insurance and health policy decisions. First in Hungary, we developed a complex computerized case management, data collection, processing, and analysis program (OncoGenomic) and a self-learning artificial intelligence (AI) precision medicine decision support application (Oncompass Calculator) that organize basic research (R), applied research and development (R and D) and innovation (I) under a common umbrella.

Radiology differs from other medical specialties with its high digitalization, so most software developers operationalize this area of medicine. The primary condition for machine learning is met because medical diagnostic images have high reproducibility. Today, the most common anatomic area for computed tomography is the thorax, particularly with the widespread lung cancer screening programs using low-dose computed tomography. In this regard, the amount of information that needs to be processed by a radiologist is snowballing. Thus, automatic image analysis will allow more studies to be interpreted.

dates from the 1960s (Samuel in Science, 132(3429):741-742, 1960. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.132.3429.741 ; Wiener in Cybernetics: or control and communication in the animal and the machine, MIT Press, New York, 1961). However, in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by (Deep) Neural Networks and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society, with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream. Such a debate has primarily focused on principles-the 'what' of AI ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explicability)-rather than on practices, the 'how.' Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate, but the AI community's ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy. Our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the Machine Learning development pipeline, and to signal to researchers where further work is needed. The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning, but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI. The article outlines the research method for creating this typology, the initial findings, and provides a summary of future research needs.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a growing role in the field of radiology. This article seeks to help readers quantify its impact when put into practice, using a lung nodule flagger as an example.\nThe one-time and ongoing costs associated with AI are explored. Costs are divided into three categories: direct costs, costs associated with operational changes, and downstream costs. Examples of each are provided.\nA framework for estimating the financial impact of AI is provided.\nThe impact of AI is quantifiable, but estimates of its financial impact may not be portable across contexts. Different organizations may implement AI in different ways due to differences in clinical practices. Furthermore, different organizations have different hurdle rates for their investments. Finally, international cost-effectiveness analyses may not be generalizable due to differences in both practice patterns and the valuation placed upon quality. When quantifying the impact of AI, organizations should consider relying upon pilots and data from other similarly-situated organizations.", "Virtual reality surgical simulators provide a safe environment for trainees to practice specific surgical scenarios and allow for self-guided learning. Artificial intelligence technology, including artificial neural networks, offers the potential to manipulate large datasets from simulators to gain insight into the importance of specific performance metrics during simulated operative tasks.\nTo distinguish performance in a virtual reality-simulated anterior cervical discectomy scenario, uncover novel performance metrics, and gain insight into the relative importance of each metric using artificial neural networks.\nTwenty-one participants performed a simulated anterior cervical discectomy on the novel virtual reality Sim-Ortho simulator. Participants were divided into 3 groups, including 9 post-resident, 5 senior, and 7 junior participants. This study focused on the discectomy portion of the task. Data were recorded and manipulated to calculate metrics of performance for each participant. Neural networks were trained and tested and the relative importance of each metric was calculated.\nA total of 369 metrics spanning 4 categories (safety, efficiency, motion, and cognition) were generated. An artificial neural network was trained on 16 selected metrics and tested, achieving a training accuracy of 100% and a testing accuracy of 83.3%. Network analysis identified safety metrics, including the number of contacts on spinal dura, as highly important.\nArtificial neural networks classified 3 groups of participants based on expertise allowing insight into the relative importance of specific metrics of performance. This novel methodology aids in the understanding of which components of surgical performance predominantly contribute to expertise.", "To analyze the implementation of deep learning software for the detection and worklist prioritization of acute intracranial hemorrhage on non-contrast head CT (NCCT) in various clinical settings\u00a0at an academic medical center.\nUrgent NCCT scans were reviewed by the Aidoc (Tel Aviv, Israel) neural network software. All cases flagged by the software as positive for acute intracranial hemorrhage on the neuroradiology worklist were prospectively included in this assessment. The scans were classified regarding presence and type of hemorrhage, whether these were initial or follow-up scans, and patient visit location, including trauma/emergency, inpatient, and outpatient\u00a0departments.\nDuring the 2\u00a0months of enrollment, 373 NCCT scans were flagged by the Aidoc software for possible intracranial hemorrhage out of 2011 scans analyzed (18.5%). Among the flagged cases, 275 (72.4%) were positive; 290 (77.7%) were inpatient cases, 75 (20.1%) were trauma/emergency cases, and eight (2.1%) were outpatient cases, and 229 of 373 (62.5%) were follow-up cases, of which 219 (95.6%) inpatient cases. Among the 144 new cases flagged for hemorrhage, 66 (44.4%) were positive, of which 39 (58.2%) were trauma/emergency cases. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 88.7%, 94.2% and 73.7%, 97.7%, and 93.4%, respectively. The accuracy of the intracranial hemorrhage detection was significantly higher for emergency cases than for inpatient cases (96.5% versus 89.4%).\nThis study reveals that the performance of the deep learning software for acute intracranial hemorrhage detection varies depending upon the patient visit location. Furthermore, a substantial portion of flagged cases were follow-up exams, the majority of which were inpatient exams. These findings can help optimize the artificial intelligence-driven clincical workflow.", "Heart failure (HF) is one of the most complex chronic disorders with high prevalence, mainly due to the ageing population and better treatment of underlying diseases. Prevalence will continue to rise and is estimated to reach 3% of the population in Western countries by 2025. It is the most important cause of hospitalisation in subjects aged 65 years or more, resulting in high costs and major social impact. The current \"one-size-fits-all\" approach in the treatment of HF does not result in best outcome for all patients. These facts are an imminent threat to good quality management of patients with HF. An unorthodox approach from a new vision on care is required. We propose a novel predictive, preventive and personalised medicine approach where patients are truly leading their management, supported by an easily accessible online application that takes advantage of artificial intelligence. This strategy paper describes the needs in HF care, the needed paradigm shift and the elements that are required to achieve this shift. Through the inspiring collaboration of clinical and high-tech partners from North-West Europe combining state of the art HF care, artificial intelligence, serious gaming and patient coaching, a virtual doctor is being created. The results are expected to advance and personalise self-care, where standard care tasks are performed by the patients themselves, in principle without involvement of healthcare professionals, the latter being able to focus on complex conditions. This new vision on care will significantly reduce costs per patient while improving outcomes to enable long-term sustainability of top-level HF care.", "Twins are considered to be at an increased risk for perinatal mortality and morbidities, but it is unclear whether preterm twins are at an increased risk for poor developmental outcomes when compared to preterm singletons. Our aim was to compare the neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm twins vs singletons at 5 years of age.\nVery low birth weight and very low gestational age infants (twins n\u2009=\u200966, singletons n\u2009=\u2009157) were recruited as a part of the PIPARI project in the Turku University Hospital, covering a regional population. Cognitive development, neuropsychological performance, and neurodevelopmental impairments (including cerebral palsy, hearing deficit, visual impairment, and intellectual disability) were evaluated at 5 years of age.\nTwins and singletons had otherwise similar perinatal background factors, except for the higher proportion of preterm rupture of membranes in singletons. Twins had cognitive and neuropsychological outcomes that were otherwise comparable with singletons, but they had a slightly lower verbal intelligence quotient (estimate -5.81, 95% CI -11.14 to -0.48, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Being a twin was not a risk for neurodevelopmental impairments.\nOur study shows that, contrary to a common hypothesis, the overall neurodevelopment of very preterm twins does not significantly differ from that of preterm singletons.", "Common factors are ubiquitous. For example, there is a common factor, g, for intelligence. In vision, there is much weaker evidence for such common factors. For example, visual illusion magnitudes correlate only weakly with each other. Here, we investigated whether illusions are hyper-specific as in perceptual learning. First, we tested 19 variants of the Ebbinghaus illusion that differed in color, shape, or texture. Correlations between the illusion magnitudes of the different variants were mostly significant. Second, we reanalyzed a dataset from a previous experiment where 10 illusions were tested under four conditions of luminance and found significant correlations between the different luminance conditions of each illusion. However, there were only very weak correlations between the 10 different illusions. Third, five visual illusions were tested with four orientations. Again, there were significant correlations between the four orientations of each illusion, but not across different illusions. The weak inter-illusion correlations suggest that there is no unique common mechanism for the tested illusions. We suggest that most illusions make up their own factor.", "Structural brain differences are found in adults and children with epilepsy, yet pediatric samples have been heterogeneous regarding seizure type, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and hemisphere of seizure focus. This study examines whether cortical thickness and surface area differ between children with left-hemisphere focal epilepsy (LHE) and age-matched typically developing (TD) peers. We examined whether age differentially moderated cortical thickness between groups and if cortical thickness was associated with duration of epilepsy, seizure frequency, or neuropsychological functioning.\nThirty-five children with LHE and 35 TD children completed neuropsychological testing and 3T MR imaging. Neuropsychological measures included general intelligence and executive functioning. All MRIs were normal. Surface-based morphometric processing and analyses were conducted using FreeSurfer 6.0. Regression analyses compared age by cortical thickness differences between groups. Correlational analyses examined associations between cortical thickness in these areas with neuropsychological functioning or epilepsy characteristics.\nLeft-hemisphere focal epilepsy displayed decreased cortical thickness bilaterally compared to TD controls across 6 brain regions but no differences in surface area. Moderation analyses revealed quadratic relationships between age and cortical thickness for left frontoparietal-cingulate and right superior frontal regions. Higher performance intelligence quotient (IQ) (PIQ) and verbal IQ (VIQ) and fewer parent reported executive function problems were associated with greater cortical thickness in TD children.\nChildren with LHE displayed thinner cortex extending beyond the hemisphere of seizure focus. The nonlinear pattern of cortical thickness across age occurring in TD children is not evident in the same manner in children with LHE. These differences in cortical thickness patterns were greatest in children 8-12\u202fyears old. Greater cortical thickness was associated with higher IQ and fewer executive control problems in daily activities in TD children. Thus, differences in cortical thickness in the absence of differences in surface area, suggest cortical thickness may be a sensitive proxy of subtle neuroanatomical changes that are related to neuropsychological functioning.", "This research aims to determine the relationship between spiritual intelligence and resiliency of rehabilitation staff. The reliable and validated spiritual intelligence and CD-RISC resiliency and demographic scales were used to collect data. There is a significant relationship between spiritual intelligence and the resiliency of rehabilitation staff (r\u2009=\u20090.38). Results showed that by increasing spiritual intelligence, resilience could increase.", "Open science will make science more efficient, reliable, and responsive to societal challenges. The European Commission has sought to advance open science policy from its inception in a holistic and integrated way, covering all aspects of the research cycle from scientific discovery and review to sharing knowledge, publishing, and outreach. We present the steps taken with a forward-looking perspective on the challenges laying ahead, in particular the necessary change of the rewards and incentives system for researchers (for which various actors are co-responsible and which goes beyond the mandate of the European Commission). Finally, we discuss the role of artificial intelligence (AI) within an open science perspective.", "Intelligent assistants (IAs), also known as intelligent agents, use artificial intelligence to help users achieve a goal or complete a task. IAs represent a potential solution for providing older adults with individualized assistance at home, for example, to reduce social isolation, serve as memory aids, or help with disease management. However, to design IAs for health that are beneficial and accepted by older adults, it is important to understand their beliefs about IAs, how they would like to interact with IAs for consumer health, and how they desire to integrate IAs into their homes.\nWe explore older adults' mental models and beliefs about IAs, the tasks they want IAs to support, and how they would like to interact with IAs for consumer health. For the purpose of this study, we focus on IAs in the context of consumer health information management and search.\nWe present findings from an exploratory, qualitative study that investigated older adults' perspectives of IAs that aid with consumer health information search and management tasks. Eighteen older adults participated in a multiphase, participatory design workshop in which we engaged them in discussion, brainstorming, and design activities that helped us identify their current challenges managing and finding health information at home. We also explored their beliefs and ideas for an IA to assist them with consumer health tasks. We used participatory design activities to identify areas in which they felt IAs might be useful, but also to uncover the reasoning behind the ideas they presented. Discussions were audio-recorded and later transcribed. We compiled design artifacts collected during the study to supplement researcher transcripts and notes. Thematic analysis was used to analyze data.\nWe found that participants saw IAs as potentially useful for providing recommendations, facilitating collaboration between themselves and other caregivers, and for alerts of serious illness. However, they also desired familiar and natural interactions with IAs (eg, using voice) that could, if need be, provide fluid and unconstrained interactions, reason about their symptoms, and provide information or advice. Other participants discussed the need for flexible IAs that could be used by those with low technical resources or skills.\nFrom our findings, we present a discussion of three key components of participants' mental models, including the people, behaviors, and interactions they described that were important for IAs for consumer health information management and seeking. We then discuss the role of access, transparency, caregivers, and autonomy in design for addressing participants' concerns about privacy and trust as well as its role in assisting others that may interact with an IA on the older adults' behalf.\nRR2-10.1145/3240925.3240972.", "There is little doubt that currently trait EI (Trait emotional intelligence) theory and their measures have been found valid and reliable in several research and application settings. This research provides psychometric evidence of the TEIQue-SF in Chilean general and clinical population sample (n1\u2009=\u2009335, n2\u2009=\u2009120). The results confirmed the factor structure of the instrument and supported its multidimensionality. Hierarchical and bi-factor CFA models with the Spanish-Chilean-TEIQue-SF analyzed its internal structure in the R environment, following the assessment of bi-factor ESEM models in Mplus. We performed these analyses both at the global and factor- level. CFA models did not reach acceptable fit statistics for the models, whereas ESEM models reached good to excellent fit for the bi-factor models proposed. We also implemented measurement invariance analyses, which provided evidence for full measurement invariance between the original UK validation sample and the Chilean samples up to the scalar level. Also, the means for the global trait EI factor and the four factors (Well-being, Self-control, Emotionality and Sociability) were alike previous psychometric research with the questionnaire. The results highlight the importance of performing multidimensional factor analysis through ESEM following a bi-factor interpretation of the TEIQue-SF internal structure.", "The conditions in which we are born, grow, live, work and age are key drivers of health and inequalities in life chances. To maximise health and wellbeing across the whole population, we need well-coordinated action across government sectors, in areas including economic, education, welfare, labour market and housing policy. Current research struggles to offer effective decision support on the cross-sector strategic alignment of policies, and to generate evidence that gives budget holders the confidence to change the way major investment decisions are made. This open letter introduces a new research initiative in this space. The SIPHER ( Systems Science in Public Health and Health Economics Research) Consortium brings together a multi-disciplinary group of scientists from across six universities, three government partners at local, regional and national level, and ten practice partner organisations. The Consortium's vision is a shift from health policy to healthy public policy, where the wellbeing impacts of policies are a core consideration across government sectors. Researchers and policy makers will jointly tackle fundamental questions about: a) the complex causal relationships between upstream policies and wellbeing, economic and equality outcomes; b) the multi-sectoral appraisal of costs and benefits of alternative investment options; c) public values and preferences for different outcomes, and how necessary trade-offs can be negotiated; and d) creating the conditions for intelligence-led adaptive policy design that maximises progress against economic, social and health goals. Whilst our methods will be adaptable across policy topics and jurisdictions, we will initially focus on four policy areas: Inclusive Economic Growth, Adverse Childhood Experiences, Mental Wellbeing and Housing.", "Surgeons make complex, high-stakes decisions under time constraints and uncertainty, with significant effect on patient outcomes. This review describes the weaknesses of traditional clinical decision-support systems and proposes that artificial intelligence should be used to augment surgical decision-making.\nSurgical decision-making is dominated by hypothetical-deductive reasoning, individual judgment, and heuristics. These factors can lead to bias, error, and preventable harm. Traditional predictive analytics and clinical decision-support systems are intended to augment surgical decision-making, but their clinical utility is compromised by time-consuming manual data management and suboptimal accuracy. These challenges can be overcome by automated artificial intelligence models fed by livestreaming electronic health record data with mobile device outputs. This approach would require data standardization, advances in model interpretability, careful implementation and monitoring, attention to ethical challenges involving algorithm bias and accountability for errors, and preservation of bedside assessment and human intuition in the decision-making process.\nIntegration of artificial intelligence with surgical decision-making has the potential to transform care by augmenting the decision to operate, informed consent process, identification and mitigation of modifiable risk factors, decisions regarding postoperative management, and shared decisions regarding resource use.", "Despite significant research efforts, only a few treatment approaches have been developed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies) have exhibited potential therapeutic effects for advanced HCC. With the development of gene-editing technologies, gene-sequencing technologies, big data strategies, and artificial intelligence algorithms, engineered immune cell infusion and personalized cancer vaccine therapy have emerged as important directions for anti-HCC treatment. Combining different immunotherapies or combining immunotherapies with conventional therapeutic approaches may provide synergistic effects and facilitate the development of personalized medicine. In this study, we provide an overview of the liver immunoanatomy, the potential immune mechanisms of HCC, and current (pre)clinical developments in this field.", "Trait Emotional Intelligence (EI)-related competencies are in growing demand in educational and vocational settings. The present study assesses the developmental dynamics of trait EI in emerging adulthood by capitalizing on the inclusion of a measure of trait EI in the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) called the Emotional Quotient Inventory: Mini (EQ-i: Mini). A sample of 1064 young adults (50% female) from ages 20-21 to 24-25\u2009years was used to assess 4-year rank-order stability and mean-level change of trait EI, as well as whether the EQ-i: Mini functions equivalently over time (longitudinal measurement invariance). Results revealed full configural, partial metric, and scalar invariance of the construct for this time period. The Stress Management subscale achieved invariance at the residual level. After controlling for partial non-invariance, moderate levels of rank-order stability coefficients were found, suggesting malleability of the construct during emerging adulthood. Consistent with the maturity principle, there was a moderate increase in trait EI (specifically in the Interpersonal and Adaptability subscales). The malleability of trait EI suggests opportunities for enhancing socioemotional competencies in emerging adults, such as through formal and continuing education programing, on-the-job training, and targeted employment interventions.", "To study the prevalence, clinical and genetic characteristics of primary carnitine deficiency (PCD).\nFrom January 2013 to December 2017, 720 667 newborns and their mothers were tested for PCD by tandem mass spectrometry. Potential mutations of carnitine transporter gene SLC22A5 among suspected PCD patients were analyzed. Dietary guidance and L-carnitine supplementation were provided to the parents. Growth and intelligence development were surveyed during follow-up.\nIn total 21 neonates and 6 mothers were diagnosed with PCD, which yielded an incidence of 1 in 34 317. Eighteen SLC22A5 mutations were detected, which included 4 novel mutations, namely c.1484T>C, c.394-1G>T, c.431T>C and c.265-266insGGCTCGCCACC. Eighteen patients were found to carry compound heterozygous mutations and 3 have carried homozygous SLC22A5 mutations. Three mothers carried compound heterozygous mutations and 2 carried homozygous mutations. Common mutations included c.1400C>G (42.3%), c.760C>T (11.5%) and c.51C>G (7.7%). During the 8-42 month follow-up, neonates with PCD showed no clinical symptoms but normal growth. Blood level of free carnitine was raised in all mothers after the treatment.\nThe incidence of neonatal PCD in Henan is 1 in 34 317, with the most common mutation being c.1400C>G. Above finding has enriched the spectrum of SLC22A5 gene mutations.", "Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. Although the survival rate has increased dramatically over the last decades, patients struggle with the adverse side effects of treatment. Treatment for ALL includes chemotherapy and irradiation - both of which are linked to cognitive impairments and alterations in central nervous system (CNS) structure and function detected by neuroimaging and in neurocognitive studies. The present article is a meta-analysis of the existing evidence for the mechanisms underlying changes in the CNS and neurocognitive function in ALL survivors after treatment. We found that compared with controls, ALL survivors develop: (i) cognitive sequelae in intelligence, academics, attention, memory, processing speed and executive function domains; (ii) decreased grey and white matter volume in cortical and several subcortical brain regions, with functional changes particularly in frontal regions and the hippocampus; (iii) neurocognitive impairments related to CNS changes; and (iv) reduction, but not resolution, of late neurocognitive sequelae in patients in whom prophylactic irradiation was replaced by systemic/intrathecal chemotherapy. Continued work with advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques will hopefully allow the detection of early CNS changes as biomarkers to help guide early diagnosis and intervention for neurocognitive defects in patients with childhood ALL.", "To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a deep learning algorithm for automated detection of small 18F-FDG-avid pulmonary nodules in PET scans, and to assess whether novel block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) reconstruction affects detection accuracy as compared to ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction.\nFifty-seven patients with 92 18F-FDG-avid pulmonary nodules (all \u2264 2 cm) undergoing PET/CT for oncological (re-)staging were retrospectively included and a total of 8824 PET images of the lungs were extracted using OSEM and BSREM reconstruction. Per-slice and per-nodule sensitivity of a deep learning algorithm was assessed, with an expert readout by a radiologist/nuclear medicine physician serving as standard of reference. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve of OSEM and BSREM were assessed and the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) were compared. A maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax)-based sensitivity analysis and a size-based sensitivity analysis with subgroups defined by nodule size was performed.\nThe AUC of the deep learning algorithm for nodule detection using OSEM reconstruction was 0.796 (CI 95%; 0.772-0.869), and 0.848 (CI 95%; 0.828-0.869) using BSREM reconstruction. The AUC was significantly higher for BSREM compared to OSEM (p = 0.001). On a per-slice analysis, sensitivity and specificity were 66.7% and 79.0% for OSEM, and 69.2% and 84.5% for BSREM. On a per-nodule analysis, the overall sensitivity of OSEM was 81.5% compared to 87.0% for BSREM.\nOur results suggest that machine learning algorithms may aid detection of small 18F-FDG-avid pulmonary nodules in clinical PET/CT. AI performed significantly better on images with BSREM than OSEM.\n\u2022 The diagnostic value of deep learning for detecting small lung nodules (\u2264 2 cm) in PET images using BSREM and OSEM reconstruction was assessed. \u2022 BSREM yields higher SUVmaxof small pulmonary nodules as compared to OSEM reconstruction. \u2022 The use of BSREM translates into a higher detectability of small pulmonary nodules in PET images as assessed with artificial intelligence.", "Most clinical risk stratification models are based on measurement at a single time-point rather than serial measurements. Artificial intelligence (AI) is able to predict one-dimensional outcomes from multi-dimensional datasets. Using data from Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field (GARFIELD)-AF registry, a new AI model was developed for predicting clinical outcomes in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients up to 1\u2009year based on sequential measures of prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) within 30\u2009days of enrolment.\nPatients with newly diagnosed AF who were treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and had at least three measurements of PT-INR taken over the first 30\u2009days after prescription were analysed. The AI model was constructed with multilayer neural network including long short-term memory and one-dimensional convolution layers. The neural network was trained using PT-INR measurements within days 0-30 after starting treatment and clinical outcomes over days 31-365 in a derivation cohort (cohorts 1-3; n\u2009=\u20093185). Accuracy of the AI model at predicting major bleed, stroke/systemic embolism (SE), and death was assessed in a validation cohort (cohorts 4-5; n\u2009=\u20091523). The model's c-statistic for predicting major bleed, stroke/SE, and all-cause death was 0.75, 0.70, and 0.61, respectively.\nUsing serial PT-INR values collected within 1\u2009month after starting VKA, the new AI model performed better than time in therapeutic range at predicting clinical outcomes occurring up to 12\u2009months thereafter. Serial PT-INR values contain important information that can be analysed by computer to help predict adverse clinical outcomes.", "The drug development is generally arduous, costly, and success rates are low. Thus, the identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) has become a crucial step in early stages of drug discovery. Consequently, developing computational approaches capable of identifying potential DTIs with minimum error rate are increasingly being pursued. These computational approaches aim to narrow down the search space for novel DTIs and shed light on drug functioning context. Most methods developed to date use binary classification to predict if the interaction between a drug and its target exists or not. However, it is more informative but also more challenging to predict the strength of the binding between a drug and its target. If that strength is not sufficiently strong, such DTI may not be useful. Therefore, the methods developed to predict drug-target binding affinities (DTBA) are of great value. In this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of the existing methods that predict DTBA. We focus on the methods developed using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches, as well as related benchmark datasets and databases. Furthermore, guidance and recommendations are provided that cover the gaps and directions of the upcoming work in this research area. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive comparison analysis of tools focused on DTBA with reference to AI/ML/DL.", "In recent years, gait analysis outside the laboratory attracts more and more attention in clinical applications as well as in life sciences. Wearable sensors such as inertial sensors show high potential in these applications. Unfortunately, they can only measure kinematic motions patterns indirectly and the outcome is currently jeopardized by measurement discrepancies compared with the gold standard of optical motion tracking. The aim of this study was to overcome the limitation of measurement discrepancies and the missing information on kinetic motion parameters using a machine learning application based on artificial neural networks. For this purpose, inertial sensor data-linear acceleration and angular rate-was simulated from a database of optical motion tracking data and used as input for a feedforward and long short-term memory neural network to predict the joint angles and moments of the lower limbs during gait. Both networks achieved mean correlation coefficients higher than 0.80 in the minor motion planes, and correlation coefficients higher than 0.98 in the sagittal plane. These results encourage further applications of artificial intelligence to support gait analysis. Graphical Abstract The graphical abstract displays the processing of the data: IMU data is used as input to a feedforward and a long short-term memory neural network to predict the joint kinematics and kinetics of the lower limbs during gait.", "The methods of machine learning and artificial intelligence are slowly but surely being introduced in everyday medical practice. In the future, they will support us in diagnosis and therapy and thus improve treatment for the benefit of the individual patient. It is therefore important to deal with this topic and to develop a\u00a0basic understanding of it.\nThis article gives an overview of the exciting and dynamic field of machine learning and serves as an introduction to some methods primarily from the realm of supervised learning. In addition to definitions and simple examples, limitations are discussed.\nThe basic principles behind the methods are simple. Nevertheless, due to their high dimensional nature, the factors influencing the results are often difficult or impossible to understand by humans. In order to build confidence in the new technologies and to guarantee their safe application, we need explainable algorithms and prospective effectiveness studies.", "Digital health or eHealth technologies, notably pervasive computing, robotics, big-data, wearable devices, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI), have opened unprecedented opportunities as to how the diseases are diagnosed and managed with active patient engagement. Patient-related data have provided insights (real world data) into understanding the disease processes. Advanced analytics have refined these insights further to draw dynamic algorithms aiding clinicians in making more accurate diagnosis with the help of machine learning. AI is another tool, which, although is still in the evolution stage, has the potential to help identify early signs even before the clinical features are apparent. The evolving digital developments pose challenges on allowing access to health-related data for further research but, at the same time, protecting each patient's privacy. This review focuses on the recent technological advances and their applications and highlights the immense potential to enable early diagnosis of rheumatological diseases.", "Bullying and cyberbullying are important global issues with negative consequences for physical and mental health in education. The objective of this study was to analyze to what extent some dimensions of emotional intelligence predict certain manifestations of bullying and cyberbullying in adolescents. The total number of subjects recruited in compulsory secondary education schools, was 309 (53.1% female). Their ages ranged from 12 to 16 (M = 14.17, SD = 1.4). The used instruments were the school violence questionnaire and the emotional coefficient inventory; the study design was cross-sectional. Results showed that the score increases on some scales (adaptability, stress management, and interpersonal) involved a greater risk of increasing the likelihood of social perception the different manifestations of school violence. However, in the general mood, the increase in this variable score implied lower perceiving in likelihood of violent behavior. It is important to take into account preventive actions aimed at improving school life and, above all, to alleviate difficulties in managing stress, adaptability, and interpersonal relationships.", "DNA typing and genetic profile data interpretation are among the most relevant topics in forensic science; among other applications, genetic profile's capability to distinguish biogeographic information about population groups, subgroups and affiliations have been largely explored in the last decade. In fact, for investigative and intelligence purposes, it is extremely useful to identify subjects and estimate their biogeographic origins by examining the recovered DNA profiles from evidence on a crime scene. Current approaches for BiogeoGraphic Ancestry (BGA) estimation using STRs profiles are usually based on Bayesian methods, which quantify the evidence in terms of likelihood ratio, supporting or not the hypothesis that a certain profile belongs to a specific ethnic group. The present study provides an alternative approach to the likelihood ratio method that involves multivariate data analysis strategies for the estimation of multiple populations. Starting from the well-known NIST US autosomal STRs dataset involving African-American, Asian, and Caucasian individuals, and moving towards further and more geographically restricted populations (such as Northern Africans vs sub-Saharan Africans, Afghans vs Iraqis and Italians vs Romanians), powerful multivariate techniques such as Sparse and Logistic Principal Component Analysis (SL-PCA), Sparse Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were employed and their discriminating power was also compared. Both sPLS-DA and SVM techniques provided robust classifications, yielding high sensitivity and specificity models capable of discriminating populations on ethnic basis. This application may represent a powerful and dynamic tool for law enforcement agencies whenever a standard autosomal STR profile is obtained from the biological evidence collected at a crime scene or recovered during mass-disaster and missing person investigations.", "CO2 geological sequestration in coal seams has gradually become one of the effective means to deal with the global greenhouse effect. However, the injection of CO2 into the coal seam can have an important impact on the physical and chemical properties of coal, which in turn affects the CO2 sequestration performance in coal seams and causes a large number of environmental problems. In order to better evaluate the strength alteration of coal in CO2 geological sequestration, a hybrid artificial intelligence model integrating back propagation neural network (BPNN), genetic algorithm (GA) and adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) is proposed. A total of 112 data samples for unconfined compressive strength (UCS) are retrieved from the reported studies to train and verify the proposed model. The input variables for the predictive model include coal rank, CO2 interaction time, CO2 interaction temperature and CO2 saturation pressure, and the corresponding output variable is the measured UCS. The predictive model performance is evaluated by correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The predictive results denote that the GA-BPNN-AdaBoost predictive model is an efficient and accurate method to predict coal strength alteration induced by CO2 adsorption. The simultaneous optimization of BPNN by GA and AdaBoost algorithm can greatly improve the prediction accuracy and generalization ability of the model. At the same time, the mean impact value (MIV) is used to investigate the relative importance of each input variable. The relative importance scores of coal rank, CO2 interaction time, CO2 interaction temperature and CO2 saturation pressure are 0.5475, 0.2822, 0.0373, 0.1330, respectively. The research results in this paper can provide important guiding significance for CO2 geological sequestration in coal seams.", "Machine learning-based similarity analysis is commonly found in many artificial intelligence applications like the one utilized in e-commerce and digital marketing. In this study, a kNN-based (k-nearest neighbors) similarity method is proposed for rapid biopharmaceutical process diagnosis and process performance monitoring. Our proposed application measures the spatial distance between batches, identifies the most similar historical batches, and ranks them in order of similarity. The proposed method considers the similarity in both multivariate and univariate feature spaces and measures batch deviations to a benchmarking batch. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are tested on a drug manufacturing process at Biogen.", "We propose a new model to improve maize breeding that incorporates doubled haploid production, genomic selection, and genome optimization. Breeding 4.0 has been considered the next era of plant breeding. It is clear that the Breeding 4.0 era for maize will feature the integration of multi-disciplinary technologies including genomics and phenomics, gene editing and synthetic biology, and Big Data and artificial intelligence. The breeding approach of passively selecting ideal genotypes from designated genetic pools must soon evolve to virtual design of optimized genomes by pyramiding superior alleles using computational simulation. An optimized genome expressing optimal phenotypes, which may never actually be created, can function as a blueprint for breeding programs to use minimal materials and hybridizations to achieve maximum genetic gain. We propose a new breeding pipeline, \"genomic design breeding,\" that incorporates doubled haploid production, genomic selection, and genome optimization and is facilitated by different scales of trait predictions and decision-making models. Successful implementation of the proposed model will facilitate the evolution of maize breeding from \"art\" to \"science\" and eventually to \"intelligence,\" in the Breeding 4.0 era.", "Peripheral intravenous catheters connected to an infusion pump are necessary for the delivery of fluids, nutrition, and medications to hospitalized neonates but are not without complications. These adverse events contribute to hospital-acquired patient harm. An artificial intelligence theory called fuzzy logic may allow the use of appropriate variables to predict infusion failure.\nThis innovative study aimed to develop an intravenous infusion nanotechnology monitoring system that would alert the nurse to impending peripheral intravenous infusion failure.\nAn intravenous infusion nanotechnology monitoring system, using predictor variables of pressure, pH, and oxygen saturation used in a fuzzy logic alarm algorithm was developed to alert the nurse to impending peripheral intravenous infusion failure.\nThe developed intravenous infusion nanotechnology monitoring system is composed of a peripheral intravenous catheter with nanotechnology multimodal sensor, an intravenous pump, a fuzzy logic algorithm, and alarm. For example, using this system, an elevated in-line pressure, a low pH, and a low venous oxygen level would generate an alarm for possible impending infusion failure.\nWith further development, this technology may help nurses predict and prevent adverse outcomes from intravenous infusions. This work shows how nurses can be content experts and innovators of technology that they use to make clinical decisions.\nAfter regulatory approval, a randomized controlled trial may be performed to investigate whether interventions at the time of an alarm would result in fewer adverse outcomes and improve safety.", "The evaluation of thyroid nodules with ultrasonography has created a large burden for radiologists. Artificial intelligence technology has been rapidly developed in recent years to reduce the cost of labor and improve the differentiation of thyroid malignancies. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of a novel computer-aided diagnosing system (CADs: S-detect) for the ultrasound (US) interpretation of thyroid nodule subtypes in a specialized thyroid center.\nOur study prospectively included 180 thyroid nodules that underwent ultrasound interpretation. The CADs and radiologist assessed all nodules. The ultrasonographic features of different subtypes were analyzed, and the diagnostic performances of the CADs and radiologist were compared.\nThere were seven subtypes of thyroid nodules, among which papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) accounted for 50.6% and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) accounted for 2.2%. Among all thyroid nodules, the CADs presented a higher sensitivity and lower specificity than the radiologist (90.5% vs 81.1%; 41.2% vs 83.5%); the radiologist had a higher accuracy than the CADs (82.2% vs 67.2%) for diagnosing malignant thyroid nodules. The accuracy of the CADs was not as good as that of the radiologist in diagnosing PTCs (70.9% vs 82.1%). The CADs and radiologist presented accuracies of 43.8% and 60.9% in identifying FTCs, respectively.\nThe ultrasound CADs presented a higher sensitivity for identifying malignant thyroid nodules than experienced radiologists. The CADs was not as good as experienced radiologists in a specialized thyroid center in identifying PTCs. Radiologists maintained a higher specificity than the CADs for FTC detection.", "Engineered structures in the open ocean are becoming more frequent with the expansion of the marine renewable energy industry and offshore marine aquaculture. Floating engineered structures function as artificial patch reefs providing novel and relatively stable habitat structure not otherwise available in the pelagic water column. The enhanced physical structure can increase local biodiversity and benefit fisheries yet can also facilitate the spread of invasive species. Clear evidence of any ecological consequences will inform the design and placement of structures to either minimise negative impacts or enhance ecosystem restoration. The development of rapid, cost-effective and reliable remote underwater monitoring methods is crucial to supporting evidence-based decision-making by planning authorities and developers when assessing environmental risks and benefits of offshore structures. A novel, un-baited midwater video system, PelagiCam, with motion-detection software (MotionMeerkat) for semi-automated monitoring of mobile marine fauna, was developed and tested on the UK's largest offshore rope-cultured mussel farm in Lyme Bay, southwest England. PelagiCam recorded Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), garfish (Belone belone) and two species of jellyfish (Chrysaora hysoscella and Rhizostoma pulmo) in open water close to the floating farm structure. The software successfully distinguished video frames where fishes were present versus absent. The PelagiCam system provides a cost-effective remote monitoring tool to streamline biological data acquisition in impact assessments of offshore floating structures. With the rise of sophisticated artificial intelligence for object recognition, the integration of computer vision techniques should receive more attention in marine ecology and has great potential to revolutionise marine biological monitoring.", "This study aimed at testing the differences in emotional intelligence ability between women with fibromyalgia (cases) and their age-matched counterparts not with fibromyalgia from the general population (controls) and analysing the association between emotional intelligence ability and widespread pain in women with fibromyalgia. A total of 133 cases and 77 controls participated in this cross-sectional study. Controls performed better than cases on emotion understanding. Higher emotion perception and management were significantly associated with lower widespread pain. Therefore, women with fibromyalgia may experience difficulties in understanding emotional information. In fibromyalgia, higher emotion perception and management abilities are independently related to lower widespread pain.", "Optical chirality occurs when materials interact differently with light in a specific circular polarization state. Chiroptical phenomena inspire wide interdisciplinary investigations, which require advanced designs to reach strong chirality for practical applications. The development of artificial intelligence provides a new vision for the manipulation of light-matter interaction beyond the theoretical interpretation. Here, we report a self-consistent framework named the Bayesian optimization and convolutional neural network that combines Bayesian optimization and deep convolutional neural network algorithms to calculate and optimize optical properties of metallic nanostructures. Both electric-field distributions at the near field and reflection spectra at the far field are calculated and self-learned to suggest better structure designs and provide possible explanations for the origin of the optimized properties, which enables wide applications for future nanostructure analysis and design.", "Automatic segmentation of vestibular schwannomas (VSs) from MRI could significantly improve clinical workflow and assist in patient management. Accurate tumor segmentation and volumetric measurements provide the best indicators to detect subtle VS growth, but current techniques are labor intensive and dedicated software is not readily available within the clinical setting. The authors aim to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework to be embedded in the clinical routine for automatic delineation and volumetry of VS.\nImaging data (contrast-enhanced T1-weighted [ceT1] and high-resolution T2-weighted [hrT2] MR images) from all patients meeting the study's inclusion/exclusion criteria who had a single sporadic VS treated with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery were used to create a model. The authors developed a novel AI framework based on a 2.5D convolutional neural network (CNN) to exploit the different in-plane and through-plane resolutions encountered in standard clinical imaging protocols. They used a computational attention module to enable the CNN to focus on the small VS target and propose a supervision on the attention map for more accurate segmentation. The manually segmented target tumor volume (also tested for interobserver variability) was used as the ground truth for training and evaluation of the CNN. We quantitatively measured the Dice score, average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and relative volume error (RVE) of the automatic segmentation results in comparison to manual segmentations to assess the model's accuracy.\nImaging data from all eligible patients (n = 243) were randomly split into 3 nonoverlapping groups for training (n = 177), hyperparameter tuning (n = 20), and testing (n = 46). Dice, ASSD, and RVE scores were measured on the testing set for the respective input data types as follows: ceT1 93.43%, 0.203 mm, 6.96%; hrT2 88.25%, 0.416 mm, 9.77%; combined ceT1/hrT2 93.68%, 0.199 mm, 7.03%. Given a margin of 5% for the Dice score, the automated method was shown to achieve statistically equivalent performance in comparison to an annotator using ceT1 images alone (p = 4e-13) and combined ceT1/hrT2 images (p = 7e-18) as inputs.\nThe authors developed a robust AI framework for automatically delineating and calculating VS tumor volume and have achieved excellent results, equivalent to those achieved by an independent human annotator. This promising AI technology has the potential to improve the management of patients with VS and potentially other brain tumors.", "There is a plethora of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that are being developed around the world aiming at either speeding up or improving the accuracy of radiologists. It is essential for radiologists to work with the developers of such algorithms to determine true clinical utility and risks associated with these algorithms. We present a framework, called an Algorithmic Audit, for working with the developers of such algorithms to test and improve the performance of the algorithms. The framework includes concepts of true independent validation on data that the algorithm has not seen before, curating datasets for such testing, deep examination of false positives and false negatives (to examine implications of such errors) and real-world deployment and testing of algorithms.", "The dystopian scenario of an 'artificial intelligence takeover' imagines artificial intelligence (AI) becoming the dominant form of intelligence on Earth, rendering humans redundant. As a society we have become increasingly familiar with AI and robots replacing humans in many tasks, certain jobs and even some areas of medicine, but surely this is not the fate of psychiatry?Here a computational neuroscientist (Janaina Mour\u00e3o-Miranda) and psychiatrist (Justin Taylor Baker) suggest that psychiatry as a profession is relatively safe, whereas psychiatrists Christian Brown and Giles William Story predict that robots will be taking over the asylum.", "Machine learning and artificial intelligence are mostly important if data analysis by knowledge-based analytical methods is difficult and complex. In such cases, combined analytical and empirical approaches based on AI are also meaningful. The development and validation of several clinical parameters for the Corvis ST are a concrete example of this approach. In this article, the development of three screening parameters is described. It is shown how these developments lead to clinical solutions that can be beneficial for detecting clinical and subclinical keratoconus as well as for glaucoma screening.\nMachine Learning stellt insbesondere dann eine sinnvolle Alternative dar, wenn eine Datenanalyse mit wissensbasierten analytischen Methoden sehr aufwendig und schwierig ist. In solchen F\u00e4llen bietet sich auch eine Kombination aus analytischen Methoden und empirischen Methoden mittels k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz (KI) an. Die Entwicklung verschiedener Auswertefunktionen des Corvis ST ist hierf\u00fcr ein konkretes Beispiel. In diesem Beitrag wird die Entwicklung dreier Screening-Parameter mittels KI beschrieben. Der Artikel zeigt, wie diese Entwicklungen im Bereich der Erkennung von klinischem und subklinischem Keratokonus sowie Glaukom-Screening klinisch hilfreich sind.", "Short tandem repeat (STR) profiling is one of the mostly used systems for forensic applications. In certain circumstances, STR profiling is time-consuming and costly, which potentially leads to delays in criminal investigations. LGC (Laboratory of the Government Chemist, UK) Forensics has developed a robust STR profiling platform called the ParaDNA\u00ae Intelligence Test System which can provide early tactical intelligence and aid investigators in making informed decisions on sample prioritization for detection. Here, we validated the ParaDNA intelligence test for its application in forensic cases using a range of mock evidence items following guidelines set by the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM). Specifically, we tested the sensitivity and accuracy of the ParaDNA intelligence test, as well as the success rates for detecting mock samples and for use in case scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that the ParaDNA intelligence test generates useful DNA profiles, especially for samples such as blood, saliva, and semen that contain ample DNA, indicating the benefits of including ParaDNA as a prior step in forensic STR profiling pipelines.", "HIV-associated cognitive deficiency in perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV) children has been studied in Western countries in a population of which an increasing proportion has been internationally adopted. Studies often lack an appropriate internationally adopted HIV-uninfected control group, potentially confounding the relationship between HIV and cognitive functioning. This study aims to further elucidate the association between treated HIV infection and cognitive development by addressing the background of international adoption.\nWe cross-sectionally studied the impact of HIV on cognition by comparing PHIV children and HIV- uninfected controls, matched for age-, sex-, ethnicity-, socioeconomic status (SES)- and adoption status. We used a standardized neuropsychological test battery to measure intelligence (IQ), and the cognitive domains of processing speed, working memory, executive function, learning ability and visual-motor function and compared outcomes using lineair regression models, adjusted for IQ. We determined cognitive profiles and cognitive impairment by using multivariate normative comparison (MNC) and explored associations with HIV disease- and treatment-related factors.\nWe enrolled fourteen PHIV children (mean age 10.45 years [1.73 SD], 93% adopted from sub-Saharan Africa at a median age of 3.3 years [IQR 2.1-4.2]) and fifteen HIV- uninfected controls. Groups did not clinically nor statistically differ in age, sex, ethnicity, SES, region of birth, adoption status and age at adoption. PHIV scored consistently lower on all cognitive domains and MNC outcomes. Compared to controls, PHIV children had a significant lower IQ (mean 81 [SD 11] versus mean 97 [SD 15], p = 0.005), and a poorer cognitive profile by MNC (Hotelling's T2 mean -4.36 [SD 5.6] versus mean 0.16 [SD 4.5], p = 0.021), not associated with HIV disease- and treatment-related factors. Two PHIV (14%) and one control (7%) were classified as cognitively impaired (p = 0.598).\nFindings indicate treated HIV-infection to be independently associated with lower IQ and poorer cognitive profiles in PHIV children, irrespective of a background of international adoption.", "Dispositional optimism reflects one's generalized positive expectancies for future outcomes and plays a crucial role in personal developmental outcomes and health (e.g., counteracting related mental disorders such as depression and anxiety). Increasing evidence has suggested that extraversion is an important personality factor contributing to dispositional optimism. However, less is known about the association between dispositional optimism and brain structure and the role of extraversion in this association. Here, we examined these issues in 231 healthy high school students aged 16 to 20\u2009years (110 males, mean age = 18.48\u2009years, SD = 0.54) by estimating regional gray matter density (rGMD) using a voxel-based morphometry method via structural magnetic resonance imaging. Whole-brain regression analyses revealed a significant positive correlation between dispositional optimism and the rGMD of the bilateral putamen after adjusting for age, sex, family socioeconomic status (SES), general intelligence, and total gray matter volume (TGMV). Moreover, prediction analyses using fourfold balanced cross-validation combined with linear regression confirmed a significant connection between dispositional optimism and putamen density after adjusting for age, sex, and family SES. More importantly, subsequent mediation analysis showed that extraversion may account for the association between putamen density and dispositional optimism after adjusting for age, sex, family SES, general intelligence, TGMV, and the other four Big Five personality traits. Taken together, the current study provides new evidence regarding the neurostructural basis underlying dispositional optimism in adolescents and underscores the importance of extraversion as an essential personality factor for dispositional optimism acquisition.", "Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience impairing challenges in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts. While social skills group training (SSGT) has shown moderate effects on various sociability outcomes in ASD, there is a need for (1) replication of effects in additional clinical and cultural contexts, (2) designs that employ active control groups, (3) calculation of health economic benefits, (4) identification of the optimal training duration, and (5) measurement of individual goals and quality of life outcomes.\nWith the aim of investigating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a SSGT, KONTAKT\u00a9, a two-armed randomized control trial with adolescents aged 12-17 years (N\u2009=\u200990) with ASD and an intelligence quotient (IQ) of over 70 will be undertaken. Following stratification for centre and gender, participants will be randomly assigned to either KONTAKT\u00a9 or to an active control group, a group-based cooking programme. Participants will attend both programmes in groups of 6-8 adolescents, over 16 one-and-a-half-hour sessions. The primary outcome examined is adolescent self-rated achievement of personally meaningful social goals as assessed via the Goal Attainment Scaling during an interview with a blinded clinician. Secondary outcomes include adolescent self-reported interpersonal efficacy, quality of life, social anxiety, loneliness, face emotion recognition performance and associated gaze behaviour, and parent proxy reports of autistic traits, quality of life, social functioning, and emotion recognition and expression. Cost-effectiveness will be investigated in relation to direct and indirect societal and healthcare costs.\nThe primary outcomes of this study will be evidenced in the anticipated achievement of adolescents' personally meaningful social goals following participation in KONTAKT\u00a9 as compared to the active control group. This design will enable rigorous evaluation of the efficacy of KONTAKT\u00a9, exercising control over the possibly confounding effect of exposure to a social context of peers with a diagnosis of ASD.\nAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR).

We calculated the proportion of medical claims with \u22651 NDC and identified select biologics using four different approaches: (a) specific HCPCS alone, (b) specific HCPCS and NDC, (c) non-specific HCPCS with NDC, and (d) HCPCS with modifiers (applicable to biosimilars). Numbers of dispensings were calculated for each biologic by approach and select patient and claim characteristics.\nMore than 1.5 million eligible participants contributed approximately 4 million person-years of data, including 1.2 billion medical claims. The proportion of medical claims with \u22651 NDC increased from 1.2% in 2013 to 3.0% in 2017. Medical claim NDCs identified 39% and 28% of vedolizumab dispensed in 2014 and 2015 and 30% of Epogen/Procrit dispensed overall. Out of 26,381 filgrastim biosimilar dispensings identified, 51% had a HCPCS modifier and 12% had a medical claim NDC for Zarxio. HCPCS modifiers and medical claim NDCs were present for 38% and 3% of all infliximab biosimilars dispensed (total n = 1,244).\nMedical claim NDC and HCPCS modifier improves identification of select biologics without product-specific HCPCS code, thereby facilitating product-specific biologic research.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a substantial role in many domains, including medical fields. However, we still lack evidence to support whether or not cancer patients will accept the clinical use of AI. This research aims to assess the attitudes of Chinese cancer patients toward the clinical use of artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM), and to analyze the possible influencing factors.\nA questionnaire was delivered to 527 participants. Targeted people were Chinese cancer patients who were informed of their cancer diagnosis.\nThe effective response rate was 76.3% (402/527). Most cancer patients trusted AIMs in both stages of diagnosis and treatment, and participants who had heard of AIMs were more likely to trust them in the diagnosis phase. When an AIM's diagnosis diverged from a human doctor' s, ethnic minorities, and those who had received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), had never received chemotherapy, were more likely to choose \"AIM\", and when an AIM's therapeutic advice diverged from a human doctor's, male participants, and those who had received TCM or surgery, were more likely to choose \"AIM\".\nMost Chinese cancer patients believed in the AIM to some extent. Nevertheless, most still thought that oncology physicians were more trustworthy when their opinions diverged. Participants' gender, race, treatment received, and AIM related knowledge might influence their attitudes toward the AIM. Most participants thought AIM would assist oncology physicians in the future, while little really believed that oncology physicians would completely be replaced.", "Lung cancer is the second most common cancer for men and women; the wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) offers a potential to accelerate cohort-related epidemiological studies using informatics approaches. Since manual extraction from large volumes of text materials is time consuming and labor intensive, some efforts have emerged to automatically extract information from text for lung cancer patients using natural language processing (NLP), an artificial intelligence technique.\nIn this study, using an existing cohort of 2311 lung cancer patients with information about stage, histology, tumor grade, and therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery) manually ascertained, we developed and evaluated an NLP system to extract information on these variables automatically for the same patients from clinical narratives including clinical notes, pathology reports and surgery reports.\nEvaluation showed promising results with the recalls for stage, histology, tumor grade, and therapies achieving 89, 98, 78, and 100% respectively and the precisions were 70, 88, 90, and 100% respectively.\nThis study demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of automatically extracting pre-defined information from clinical narratives for lung cancer research.", "Brain science accelerates the study of intelligence and behavior, contributes fundamental insights into human cognition, and offers prospective treatments for brain disease. Faced with the challenges posed by imaging technologies and deep learning computational models, big data and high-performance computing (HPC) play essential roles in studying brain function, brain diseases, and large-scale brain models or connectomes. We review the driving forces behind big data and HPC methods applied to brain science, including deep learning, powerful data analysis capabilities, and computational performance solutions, each of which can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy and research output. This work reinforces predictions that big data and HPC will continue to improve brain science by making ultrahigh-performance analysis possible, by improving data standardization and sharing, and by providing new neuromorphic insights.", "High survival rates have led to an increased emphasis on the functional outcomes of children diagnosed with low-grade glioma. Most outcomes research has focused on risks associated with radiotherapy, but less is known about neuropsychological risks for patients treated with surgery alone. Here, the authors sought to examine the neuropsychological trajectories of children diagnosed with a low-grade glioma and monitored up to 6 years postsurgery. Secondarily, they explored demographic and clinical predictors of neuropsychological performance.\nThe neuropsychological functioning of 32 patients (median age at diagnosis 10.0 years) was prospectively assessed annually for up to 6 years after surgery (median days from surgery at baseline = 72). Tumor location was predominately supratentorial (65.6%). A combination of performance-based and parent-reported measures was used to assess intelligence, memory, executive functioning, and fine motor control in all patients.\nBinomial tests at the postoperative baseline revealed that the proportion of children falling below the average range (< 16th percentile) was significantly higher than the rate expected among healthy peers on measures of verbal memory, processing speed, executive functioning, and fine motor control (p < 0.05). Even so, linear mixed models indicated that neuropsychological functioning at the postoperative baseline did not significantly change over time for up to 6 years after surgery across all domains. A larger tumor size was associated with a slower reaction time (p < 0.01). A supratentorial tumor location and history of seizures were associated with more parent-reported executive difficulties (p < 0.01).\nWhile radiotherapy is a known risk factor for neuropsychological deficits in pediatric brain tumor patients, findings in this study indicate that children treated for low-grade glioma with surgery alone (without radiotherapy or chemotherapy) remain susceptible to difficulties with memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning that persist over time. Over half of the children in the study sample required school support services to address neuropsychological weaknesses. Although low-grade glioma is often conceptualized as a benign tumor, children treated for this lesion require ongoing monitoring and intervention to address neuropsychological weaknesses resulting from the tumor itself as well as the surgery.", "Translational bioinformatics (TBI) is focused on the integration of biomedical data science and informatics. This combination is extremely powerful for scientific discovery as well as translation into clinical practice. Several topics where TBI research is at the leading edge are 1) the use of large-scale biobanks linked to electronic health records, 2) pharmacogenomics, and 3) artificial intelligence and machine learning. This perspective discusses these three topics and points to the important elements for driving precision medicine into the future.", "With the emergence of competency-based training, the current evaluation scheme of surgical skills is evolving to include newer methods of assessment and training. Artificial intelligence through machine learning algorithms can utilize extensive data sets to analyze operator performance. This study aimed to address 3 questions: (1) Can artificial intelligence uncover novel metrics of surgical performance? (2) Can support vector machine algorithms be trained to differentiate \"senior\" and \"junior\" participants who are executing a virtual reality hemilaminectomy? (3) Can other algorithms achieve a good classification performance?\nParticipants from 4 Canadian universities were divided into 2 groups according to their training level (senior and junior) and were asked to perform a virtual reality hemilaminectomy. The position, angle, and force application of the simulated burr and suction instruments, along with tissue volumes that were removed, were recorded at 20-ms intervals. Raw data were manipulated to create metrics to train machine learning algorithms. Five algorithms, including a support vector machine, were trained to predict whether the task was performed by a senior or junior participant. The accuracy of each algorithm was assessed through leave-one-out cross-validation.\nForty-one individuals were enrolled (22 senior and 19 junior participants). Twelve metrics related to safety of the procedure, efficiency, motion of the tools, and coordination were selected. Following cross-validation, the support vector machine achieved a 97.6% accuracy. The other algorithms achieved accuracy of 92.7%, 87.8%, 70.7%, and 65.9%, respectively.\nArtificial intelligence defined novel metrics of surgical performance and outlined training levels in a virtual reality spinal simulation procedure.\nThe significance of these results lies in the potential of artificial intelligence to complement current educational paradigms and better prepare residents for surgical procedures.", "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an important natural molecule involved in fundamental biological processes, including the TCA cycle, OXPHOS, \u03b2-oxidation, and is a co-factor for proteins promoting healthy longevity. NAD+ depletion is associated with the hallmarks of ageing and may contribute to a wide range of age-related diseases including metabolic disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. One of the central pathways by which NAD+ promotes healthy ageing is through regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis via mitochondrial biogenesis and the clearance of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy. Here, we highlight the contribution of the NAD+-mitophagy axis to ageing and age-related diseases, and evaluate how boosting NAD+ levels may emerge as a promising therapeutic strategy to counter ageing as well as neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. The potential use of artificial intelligence to understand the roles and molecular mechanisms of the NAD+-mitophagy axis in ageing is discussed, including possible applications in drug target identification and validation, compound screening and lead compound discovery, biomarker development, as well as efficacy and safety assessment. Advances in our understanding of the molecular and cellular roles of NAD+ in mitophagy will lead to novel approaches for facilitating healthy mitochondrial homoeostasis that may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy to counter ageing-associated pathologies and/or accelerated ageing.", "We assess behavioral and attentional problems and neurocognitive functioning in school-aged children with primary snoring (PS).\nSeventeen children with PS and 27 non-snoring peers aged 6-10\u00a0years took part in the study. All children underwent a polysomnography (PSG) at the Sleep Laboratory. Snoring was defined by parents and with PSG. Children with obstructive sleep apnea were excluded. The parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Parents and teachers assessed behavioral and attentional problems with the Child Behavior Checklist and the Conners' Rating Scale-Revised. Neuropsychological assessment included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY test).\nThe PS group had significantly more parent-reported internalizing, total, and attentional problems than the control group. Teachers did not report behavioral problems in the PS group. The PS and control groups had equal IQ scores and similar core neurocognitive functions, except for one visuospatial subtest. The PS group had significantly more inspiratory flow limitation and increased diaphragmatic electromyography compared with the controls. Parents reported significantly more daytime sleepiness in the PS group. Daytime sleepiness and snoring time were consistently associated with more behavioral and attentional problems. Flow limitation and more oxygen saturation values under 90% were associated with attentional problems, higher oxygen desaturation index, and lower mean oxygen saturation percentage with reduced language functions.\nSnoring with an increase in respiratory effort without apneas and hypopneas and parent-reported daytime sleepiness may be linked to daytime symptoms. School-aged children with PS are at risk for behavioral and attentional problems, but not cognitive impairments.", "Although recent studies suggest that the mere presence of a smartphone might negatively impact on working memory capacity, fluid intelligence, and attentional processes, less is known about the individual differences that are liable to moderate this cognitive interference effect. This study tested whether individual differences in emotion-related impulsivity traits (positive urgency and negative urgency) moderate the effect of smartphone availability on cognitive performance. We designed an experiment in which 132 college students (age 18-25 years) completed a laboratory task that assessed visual working memory capacity in three different conditions: two conditions differing in terms of smartphone availability (smartphone turned off and visible, smartphone in silent mode and visible) and a condition in which the smartphone was not available and was replaced by a calculator (control condition). Participants also completed self-reports that assessed their thoughts after the task performance, positive/negative urgency, and problematic smartphone use. The results showed that participants with higher positive urgency presented increased cognitive interference (reflected by poorer task performance) in the \"silent-mode smartphone\" condition compared with participants in the \"turned-off smartphone\" condition. The present study provides new insights into the psychological factors that explain how smartphone availability is liable to interfere with high-level cognitive processes.", "Automatic decision support systems have gained importance in health sector in recent years. In parallel with recent developments in the fields of artificial intelligence and image processing, embedded systems are also used in decision support systems for tumor diagnosis. Extreme learning machine (ELM), is a recently developed, quick and efficient algorithm which can quickly and flawlessly diagnose tumors using machine learning techniques. Similarly, significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FRFCM) is a novel and fast algorithm which can display a high performance. In the present study, a brain tumor segmentation approach is proposed based on extreme learning machine and significantly fast and robust fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms (BTS-ELM-FRFCM) running on Raspberry Pi (PRI) hardware. The present study mainly aims to introduce a new segmentation system hardware containing new algorithms and offering a high level of accuracy the health sector. PRI's are useful mobile devices due to their cost-effectiveness and satisfying hardware. 3200 training images were used to train ELM in the present study. 20 pieces of MRI images were used for testing process. Figure of merid (FOM), Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC) and Dice indexes were used in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. In addition, the proposed method was compared with brain tumor segmentation based on support vector machine (BTS-SVM), brain tumor segmentation based on fuzzy C-means (BTS-FCM) and brain tumor segmentation based on self-organizing maps and k-means (BTS-SOM). The statistical analysis on FOM, JSC and Dice results obtained using four different approaches indicated that BTS-ELM-FRFCM displayed the highest performance. Thus, it can be concluded that the embedded system designed in the present study can perform brain tumor segmentation with a high accuracy rate.", "Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare and life-shortening condition often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Despite increased awareness, the delay to diagnosis remains unchanged. This study explores whether a predictive model based on healthcare resource utilisation can be used to screen large populations to identify patients at high risk of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Hospital Episode Statistics from the National Health Service in England, providing close to full national coverage, were used as a measure of healthcare resource utilisation. Data for patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension from the National Pulmonary Hypertension Service in Sheffield were linked to pre-diagnosis Hospital Episode Statistics records. A non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension control cohort was selected from the Hospital Episode Statistics population. Patient history was limited to \u22645 years pre-diagnosis. Information on demographics, timing/frequency of diagnoses, medical specialities visited and procedures undertaken was captured. For modelling, a bagged gradient boosting trees algorithm was used to discriminate between cohorts. Between 2008 and 2016, 709 patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension were identified and compared with a stratified cohort of 2,812,458 patients classified as non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension with \u22651 ICD-10 coded diagnosis of relevance to idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. A predictive model was developed and validated using cross-validation. The timing and frequency of the clinical speciality seen, secondary diagnoses and age were key variables driving the algorithm's performance. To identify the 100 patients at highest risk of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, 969 patients would need to be screened with a specificity of 99.99% and sensitivity of 14.10% based on a prevalence of 5.5/million. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were 10.32% and 99.99%, respectively. This study highlights the potential application of artificial intelligence to readily available real-world data to screen for rare diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. This algorithm could provide low-cost screening at a population level, facilitating earlier diagnosis, improved diagnostic rates and patient outcomes. Studies to further validate this approach are warranted.", "This study aimed to compare the intelligence profiles of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using the Korean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (K-WISC-IV) scores to differentiate between their cognitive characteristics.\nSubjects were boys with ASD (n = 49) and ADHD (n = 44). The index and subtest scores of the ASD and ADHD groups were compared using MANOVA. Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to investigate the cognitive strengths and weaknesses within the ASD and ADHD groups.\nVerbal comprehension was significantly lower in the ASD group compared to the ADHD group. The ASD group also scored lower than the ADHD group on Vocabulary, Comprehension, Picture Concepts, Picture Completion, and Symbol Search. The ADHD group scored lower than the ASD group on Digit Span. The ASD group displayed slower processing speed and social judgment, while the ADHD group exhibited poor working memory and graphomotor processing.\nThe WISC-IV profiles might help distinguishing between the cognitive characteristics of ASD and ADHD boys.", "Premature birth bears an increased risk for aberrant brain development concerning its structure and function. Cortical complexity (CC) expresses the fractal dimension of the brain surface and changes during neurodevelopment. We hypothesized that CC is altered after premature birth and associated with long-term cognitive development. One-hundred-and-one very premature-born adults (gestational age <32 weeks and/or birth weight <1500\u00a0\u200bg) and 111 term-born adults were assessed by structural MRI and cognitive testing at 26 years of age. CC was measured based on MRI by vertex-wise estimation of fractal dimension. Cognitive performance was measured based on Griffiths-Mental-Development-Scale (at 20 months) and Wechsler-Adult-Intelligence-Scales (at 26 years). In premature-born adults, CC was decreased bilaterally in large lateral temporal and medial parietal clusters. Decreased CC was associated with lower gestational age and birth weight. Furthermore, decreased CC in the medial parietal cortices was linked with reduced full-scale IQ of premature-born adults and mediated the association between cognitive development at 20 months and IQ in adulthood. Results demonstrate that CC is reduced in very premature-born adults in temporoparietal cortices, mediating the impact of prematurity on impaired cognitive development. These data indicate functionally relevant long-term alterations in the brain's basic geometry of cortical organization in prematurity.", "The rise of machine learning and deep learning technologies have allowed researchers to automate image classification. We describe a method that incorporates automated image classification and principal component analysis to evaluate computational models of biological structures. We use a computational model of the kinetochore to demonstrate our artificial-intelligence (AI)-assisted modeling method. The kinetochore is a large protein complex that connects chromosomes to the mitotic spindle to facilitate proper cell division. The kinetochore can be divided into two regions: the inner kinetochore, including proteins that interact with DNA; and the outer kinetochore, comprised of microtubule-binding proteins. These two kinetochore regions have been shown to have different distributions during metaphase in live budding yeast and therefore act as a test case for our forward modeling technique. We find that a simple convolutional neural net (CNN) can correctly classify fluorescent images of inner and outer kinetochore proteins and show a CNN trained on simulated, fluorescent images can detect difference in experimental images. A polymer model of the ribosomal DNA locus serves as a second test for the method. The nucleolus surrounds the ribosomal DNA locus and appears amorphous in live-cell, fluorescent microscopy experiments in budding yeast, making detection of morphological changes challenging. We show a simple CNN can detect subtle differences in simulated images of the ribosomal DNA locus, demonstrating our CNN-based classification technique can be used on a variety of biological structures.", "The general objective of this article is to critically review the state of the art regarding current factors accounting for aging, longevity and successful longevity. There are two major constructs which most authors are employing to account for longevity: genetic or intrinsic components versus environmental or extrinsic factors. This classification has important flaws: (i) From an epigenetic standpoint, such a polar classification could lead to misconceptions since both factors are interdependent through lifelong interactions. (ii) There are no specifications regarding these \"environmental\" factors, which include a broad heterogeneity of conditions (physical, economic, social, and cultural aspects as well as behavioral ones such as lifestyle) but do not include personal conditions, such as psychological characteristics. The review of the new paradigm called successful aging yields an important set of psycho-behavioral factors, and although population indexes such as Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) or Healthy Life expectancy (HLE) have been developed, authors do not take into consideration healthy or successful longevity as a potential prolongation of the new paradigm of active or successful aging. There is a broad corpus of research literature supporting the importance of psycho-behavioral (PB) factors intervening in the ways of aging, specifically intelligence and cognitive functioning, positive emotion and control, personality traits, psychosocial, physical conditions, and lifestyles, all of which are highly associated with active aging, health, longevity, and survival. The importance of these factors accounting for longevity, and successful longevity must be taken into consideration as a pending issue in gerontology.", "Individuals of the same chronological age exhibit disparate rates of biological ageing. Consequently, a number of methodologies have been proposed to determine biological age and primarily exploit variation at the level of DNA methylation (DNAm). A novel epigenetic clock, termed 'DNAm GrimAge' has outperformed its predecessors in predicting the risk of mortality as well as many age-related morbidities. However, the association between DNAm GrimAge and cognitive or neuroimaging phenotypes remains unknown. We explore these associations in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (n\u2009=\u2009709, mean age 73 years). Higher DNAm GrimAge was strongly associated with all-cause mortality over the eighth decade (Hazard Ratio per standard deviation increase in GrimAge: 1.81, P\u2009<\u20092.0\u2009\u00d7\u200910-16). Higher DNAm GrimAge was associated with lower age 11 IQ (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.11), lower age 73 general cognitive ability (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.18), decreased brain volume (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.25) and increased brain white matter hyperintensities (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.17). There was tentative evidence for a longitudinal association between DNAm GrimAge and cognitive decline from age 70 to 79. Sixty-nine of 137 health- and brain-related phenotypes tested were significantly associated with GrimAge. Adjusting all models for childhood intelligence attenuated to non-significance a small number of associations (12/69 associations; 6 of which were cognitive traits), but not the association with general cognitive ability (33.9% attenuation). Higher DNAm GrimAge associates with lower cognitive ability and brain vascular lesions in older age, independently of early-life cognitive ability. This epigenetic predictor of mortality associates with different measures of brain health and may aid in the prediction of age-related cognitive decline.", "Currently, there is no established technique that allows the function of a compound produced by nature to be predicted by looking at its 2-dimensional chemical structure. One of chemistry's grand challenges: to find a function for every known metabolite. We explore the opportunity for Artificial Intelligence to provide rationale interrogation of metabolites to predict their function.", "Spiritual intelligence is better defined as a capacity to discover and develop true meaning, deep purpose, and vision in life. The purpose of the present study was to determine the predictive role of demographic variables affecting the overall spiritual intelligence in diabetic adolescents.\nIn 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted involving 200 adolescents with type 1 diabetes referring to the Iranian Diabetes Association consenting to participate. The inclusion criteria were: age ranging from 15 to 21 years, more than a year since last diagnosed with diabetes, patients' full awareness of their disease, not having other physical-psychological illnesses, and not taking any psychiatric or narcotic drugs. Spiritual intelligence was measured using the Spiritual Intelligence Self Report Inventory questionnaire consisting of 24-questions. The alpha Cronbach's method was applied to validate the questionnaire in terms of content, form, and data with the reliability calculated as 0.903. Demographic data were analyzed using SPSS software version 18.\nOn total, 56% of the participants were female, 17.10 \u00b1 1.85, and the mean duration of diabetes was 5.98% \u00b1 3.79%, 62.5% reported diabetes history among immediate relatives. Forty-two percent of the participants were the oldest child in the family first children of the family and 29.5% were studying at the university. The mean score of spiritual intelligence was 60.42 60.42 ing from 15 to 21 years regression test using the enter method (ANOVA: 0.703, F: 0.739) showed that none of the demographic components explored did not significantly alter the scores that assessed spiritual intelligence.\nThe outcome of the current study portrayed that demographic features do not necessarily alter the overall spiritual intelligence scores, thereby not necessarily affecting an individual's overall spirituality.", "The aim of the present study was to investigate the process of understanding social inferences and metaphors and the pragmatic use of language through emotion recognition and social inference tests in patients diagnosed with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) mainly characterized by neurodegeneration. Additionally, we tried to identify a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker correlated with the degree and rate of cognitive decline in progressive MS patients.\nFor the purpose of the present study 25 patients, aged 20 up to 55 years, with PPMS were evaluated. All patients were admitted in the First Department of Neurology, AHEPA Hospital of Thessaloniki. The control group was 30 healthy individuals which participated in the study voluntarily. The groups were matched for age, gender, years of education and intelligence.\nSocial inference was examined with the Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT). The TASIT consists of two different parts. The \"Tasit Part I: Emotion Evaluation Task (EET - FORM A). The EET is the first part of a broader audiovisual tool designed for the clinical assessment of social perception that is called \"The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT)\". The second Part of the test TASIT - Social Inference examines the viewer's ability to determine the speaker's meaning and intentions based upon the dialogue, emotional expression, and paralinguistic cues.\nThe findings indicate that patients with PPMS show decline in emotion recognition and social inference abilities, as compared with the control group. More specifically, PPMS patients have problems to understand the affective state of the others mirroring a specific problem in ToM.\nThe level of Theory of Mind in the form of sarcasm understanding decreases significantly in MS patients compared with healthy group potentially mirroring impairment in ToM in general. The results indicate that MS group is not resilient to understand metaphoric speech. More specifically, their pathology seems to be able to affect complex ToM abilities.", "Historically, students with intellectual disability were not expected to learn to read, and thus were excluded from reading instruction. Over the past decades, societal expectations for this group of learners have changed in that children and adolescents with intellectual disability are now expected to be provided with, and benefit from, literacy instruction. This shift in societal expectations has also led to an increase in research examining effective interventions for increasing beginning reading skills for students with intellectual disability.\nTo assess the effectiveness of interventions for teaching beginning reading skills to children and adolescents with intellectual disability.\nWe searched the following electronic databases up to October 2019: CENTRAL; MEDLINE, including Epub Ahead of Print and In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase, 13 other databases, and two trials registers. We contacted authors of included studies, examined reference lists, and used Google Scholar to search for additional studies.\nWe included randomized controlled trials (including trials that use quasi-random methods of allocation such as date of birth), involving children and adolescents with intellectual disability (defined as an intelligence quotient (IQ) two standard deviations or more below the population mean) between the ages of 4 and 21 years, that evaluated the efficacy of a beginning reading intervention compared to a control intervention, including no treatment control, wait-list control, treatment as usual, attention control, or alternate non-reading instruction control.\nTwo review authors independently screened titles and abstracts yielded by the search against the inclusion criteria, and extracted data from each trial using a piloted data extraction form to collect information about the population, intervention, randomization methods, blinding, sample size, outcome measures, follow-up duration, attrition and handling of missing data, and methods of analysis. When data were missing, one review author contacted the study authors to request additional information. Two review authors assessed the risk of bias of each included study and rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (a systematic method for rating the certainty of evidence in meta-analyses). We conducted random-effect meta-analyses, with inverse-variance weighting to combine effect sizes for each of our primary and secondary outcomes. We presented effect sizes as standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nWe identified seven studies involving 352 children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities that met the inclusion criteria. All studies provided the intervention in school settings. Four studies were conducted in the USA, one in Canada, and two in the UK. Three studies were funded by grants from the US Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences; one study by the Canadian Language and Literacy Research Network and the Nova Scotia Health Research Foundation; and three studies did not indicate a funding source. We identified some concerns with risk of bias, mainly due to the difficulty of blinding of participants and personnel, and the lack of blinding of outcome assessors. Meta-analyses of the data demonstrated small-to-moderate effects of beginning reading interventions delivered to children and adolescents with intellectual disability across four dependent variables. We found medium effect sizes in favor of the beginning reading interventions for the primary outcomes of phonologic awareness (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.86; 4 studies, 178 participants; moderate-quality evidence), word reading (SMD 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.03; 5 studies, 220 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and decoding (SMD 0.40, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.67; 5 studies, 230 participants; low-quality evidence). The studies reported no adverse events. We also found a moderate effect for the secondary outcomes of oral reading fluency (SMD 0.65, 95% CI -0.12 to 1.42; 2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence) and language skills (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.54; 3 studies, 222 participants; moderate-quality evidence).\nResults from this review provide evidence that beginning reading interventions that include elements of phonologic awareness, letter sound instruction, and decoding, delivered to children and adolescents with intellectual disability, are associated with small-to-moderate improvements in phonologic awareness, word reading, decoding, expressive and receptive language, and oral reading fluency. These findings are aligned with previously conducted studies that examined the effects of reading interventions for people without intellectual disability.", "Clinicians spend a large amount of time on clinical documentation of patient encounters, often impacting quality of care and clinician satisfaction, and causing physician burnout. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) open the possibility of automating clinical documentation with digital scribes, using speech recognition to eliminate manual documentation by clinicians or medical scribes. However, developing a digital scribe is fraught with problems due to the complex nature of clinical environments and clinical conversations. This paper identifies and discusses major challenges associated with developing automated speech-based documentation in clinical settings: recording high-quality audio, converting audio to transcripts using speech recognition, inducing topic structure from conversation data, extracting medical concepts, generating clinically meaningful summaries of conversations, and obtaining clinical data for AI and ML algorithms.", "In this paper, we have described the health care problem (maldistribution of doctors) in India. Later, we have introduced the concept of artificial intelligence and we have described this technology with various examples, how it is rapidly changing the health care scenario across the world. We have also described the various advantages of artificial intelligence technology. At the end of the paper, we have raised some serious concerns regarding complete replacement of human based health care technology with artificial intelligence technology. Lastly, we concluded that we have to use artificial intelligent technology to prevent human sufferings/health care problems with proper caution.", "In May 2019, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services warned that \"around one million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction.\" In September 2019, Naomi Klein, an astute writer on environmental change, described the interconnected social and ecological breakdowns on the planet in a new book. Ecological crises noted by these and other scholars speak well to the rise of planetary health as a new scholarship. Loss of biodiversity has manifold negative impacts on health, for example, rise of zoonotic infections and changes in healthy microbiome. But reducing our ecological footprints is not enough. We ought to change mindsets, the narrow science, and technology governance regimes that value nature and other life forms instrumentally by their usefulness to us. I describe three new, broader and critically informed, frames on governance for planetary health. First, I explain why we ought to acknowledge animal sentience, for example, as recognized in Article 13 of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. I describe how political determinants of health, power, and agency operate at multiple sociological and planetary loci, not only among human beings but also at human and nonhuman animal interfaces. Second, planetary health calls for a shift toward ecological and political determinants beyond a narrow anthropocentric view, while resisting the entrenched dogma of exponential growth with finite planetary natural resources. Third, for critically informed governance of emerging technologies in planetary health (e.g., glycomics, artificial intelligence, health care robots), I refer to a question highlighted recently (Frodeman, 2019): \"When Plato (more exactly, Juvenal) asked who guards the guardians, he was questioning whether any group can be trusted to look past its own interests for the common good.\" Hence, it is time we broaden the question \"Who will guard the guardians?\" beyond the scientific community, to actors in science policy as well. Policy questions cannot be limited to \"which social issues emerge from a new technology?\" but ought to include, \"who should be framing science and technology policy, and why?\" Youth leaders of the global climate movement such as Greta Thunberg and others are now rightly asking these epistemological questions that might contribute toward a new social contract on health for all sentient beings on planet Earth. While ecological changes accelerate and a new space industry is emerging, governance for planetary health will continue to be at the epicenter of systems thinking, responsible innovation and science policy in the 21st century.", "To identify the factors influencing work engagement among psychiatric nurses.\nWork engagement is an essential outcome that promotes nurses' performance, but studies investigating its influencing factors remain limited in psychiatric settings. We hypothesized that job resources and personal resources positively predict psychiatric nurses' work engagement and have a particularly positive impact on engagement when job demand is high.\nThis cross-sectional study included 425 Japanese psychiatric nurses. Data regarding demographics, job resources, personal resources (emotional intelligence), job demand (patients' attitude towards nurses) and work engagement were collected followed by data analysis using hierarchical multiple regression.\nReward, supervisor support, nurse-physician collaboration, other-emotion appraisal and use of emotions were positively related to work engagement. Patients' unpleasant attitude towards nurses boosted the association of reward and supervisor support with work engagement.\nCertain job resources, empathic ability and self-motivation ability may enhance work engagement. Furthermore, reward and supervisor support may be particularly useful when psychiatric nurses face patients' unpleasant attitude.\nFor enhancing psychiatric nurses' work engagement, nursing leaders should educate nurses' skills related to empathy and self-motivation, consider whether nurses are confronted with patients' unpleasant attitude, and improve the job resources.", "Although electrophysiological (electroencephalography) measures of executive functions (e.g. error monitoring) have been used to predict academic achievement in typically developing children, work investigating a link between error monitoring and academic skills in children with autism spectrum disorder is limited. In this study, we employed traditional electrophysiological and advanced time-frequency methods, combined with principal component analyses, to extract neural activity related to error monitoring and tested their relations to academic achievement in cognitively able kindergarteners with autism spectrum disorder. In total, 35 cognitively able kindergarteners with autism spectrum disorder completed academic assessments and the child-friendly \"Zoo Game\" Go/No-go task at school entry. The Go/No-go task successfully elicited an error-related negativity and error positivity in children with autism spectrum disorder as young as 5\u2009years at fronto-central and posterior electrode sites, respectively. We also observed increased response-related theta power during errors relative to correct trials at fronto-central sites. Both larger error positivity and theta power significantly predicted concurrent academic achievement after controlling for behavioral performance on the Zoo Game and intelligence quotient. These results suggest that the use of time-frequency electroencephalography analyses, combined with traditional event-related potential measures, may provide new opportunities to investigate neurobiological mechanisms of executive function and academic achievement in young children with autism spectrum disorder.", "This study sought to investigate the role of emotional intelligence in both extrinsic and intrinsic career success in early and later career stages. Specifically, we examined the predictive and incremental validity of emotional intelligence in career success after controlling for personality factors in a sample of 271 graduates. When analyzing extrinsic career success, regression analyses revealed that demographic variables, such as gender, age, area of study and career stage, and the variable of proactive personality, were related to salary. When the dependent variable was job satisfaction, emotional intelligence acted as a strong predictor, even when personality traits and proactive personality were controlled. These findings provide preliminary evidence that emotional intelligence is a relevant addition to guide the achievement of career success. Finally, limitations of the results and implications of these findings are discussed.", "Biological motion is a powerful perceptual cue that can reveal important information about the inner state of an individual. Activation of inflammatory processes likely leads to changes in gait, posture, and mobility patterns, but the specific characteristics of inflammation-related biological motion have not been characterized. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of inflammation on gait and motion in humans. Systemic inflammation was induced in 19 healthy volunteers with an intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (2\u00a0ng/kg body weight). Biological motion parameters (walking speed, stride length and time, arm, leg, head, and shoulder angles) were assessed during a walking paradigm and the timed-up-and-go test. Cytokine concentrations, body temperature, and sickness symptoms were measured. During inflammation, compared to placebo, participants exhibited shorter, slower, and wider strides, less arm extension, less knee flexion, and a more downward-tilting head while walking. They were also slower and took a shorter first step in the timed-up-and-go test. Higher interleukin-6 concentrations, stronger sickness symptoms, and lower body temperature predicted the inflammation-related alterations in biological motion. These findings show that biological motion contains clear information about the inflammatory status of an individual, and may be used by peers or artificial intelligence to recognize that someone is sick or contagious.", "In view of the diagnostic complexity and the large number of examinations, modern radiology is challenged to identify clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa) with high sensitivity and specificity. Meanwhile overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically nonsignificant carcinomas need to be avoided.\nIncreasingly, international guidelines recommend multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) as first-line investigation in patients with suspected PCa.\nImage interpretation according to the PI-RADS criteria is limited by interobserver variability. Thus, rapid developments in the field of automated image analysis tools, including radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI; machine learning, deep learning), give hope for further improvement in patient care.\nAI focuses on the automated detection and classification of PCa, but it also attempts to stratify tumor aggressiveness according to the Gleason score. Recent studies present good to very good results in radiomics or AI-supported mpMRI diagnosis. Nevertheless, these systems are not widely used in clinical practice.\nIn order to apply these innovative technologies, a\u00a0growing awareness for the need of structured data acquisition, development of robust systems and an increased acceptance of AI as diagnostic support are needed. If AI overcomes these obstacles, it may play a\u00a0key role in the quantitative and reproducible image-based diagnosis of ever-increasing prostate MRI examination volumes.", "The retina is growingly recognized as a window into cerebrovascular and systemic vascular conditions. The utility of noninvasive retinal vessel biomarkers in cerebrovascular risk assessment has expanded due to advances in retinal imaging techniques and machine learning-based digital analysis. The purpose of this review is to underscore the latest evidence linking retinal vascular abnormalities with stroke and vascular-related cognitive disorders; to highlight modern developments in retinal vascular imaging modalities and software-based vasculopathy quantification.\nLongitudinal studies undertaken for extended periods indicate that retinal vascular changes can predict cerebrovascular disorders (CVD). Cerebrovascular ties to dementia provoked recent explorations of retinal vessel imaging tools for conceivable early cognitive decline detection. Innovative biomedical engineering technologies and advanced dynamic and functional retinal vascular imaging methods have recently been added to the armamentarium, allowing an unbiased and comprehensive analysis of the retinal vasculature. Improved artificial intelligence-based deep learning algorithms have boosted the application of retinal imaging as a clinical and research tool to screen, risk stratify, and monitor with precision CVD and vascular cognitive impairment.\nMounting evidence supports the use of quantitative retinal vessel analysis in predicting CVD, from clinical stroke to neuroimaging markers of stroke and neurodegeneration.", "Health care is evolving and with it the need to reform medical education. As the practice of medicine enters the age of artificial intelligence (AI), the use of data to improve clinical decision making will grow, pushing the need for skillful medicine-machine interaction. As the rate of medical knowledge grows, technologies such as AI are needed to enable health care professionals to effectively use this knowledge to practice medicine. Medical professionals need to be adequately trained in this new technology, its advantages to improve cost, quality, and access to health care, and its shortfalls such as transparency and liability. AI needs to be seamlessly integrated across different aspects of the curriculum. In this paper, we have addressed the state of medical education at present and have recommended a framework on how to evolve the medical education curriculum to include AI.", "Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has a high incidence and clinical importance, the conventional diagnosis criteria for detecting LVH using electrocardiography (ECG) has not been satisfied. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for detecting LVH.\nThis retrospective cohort study involved the review of 21\u00a0286 patients who were admitted to two hospitals between October 2016 and July 2018 and underwent 12-lead ECG and echocardiography within 4\u2009weeks. The patients in one hospital were divided into a derivation and internal validation dataset, while the patients in the other hospital were included in only an external validation dataset. An AI algorithm based on an ensemble neural network (ENN) combining convolutional and deep neural network was developed using the derivation dataset. And we visualized the ECG area that the AI algorithm used to make the decision. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the AI algorithm based on ENN was 0.880 (95% confidence interval 0.877-0.883) and 0.868 (0.865-0.871) during the internal and external validations. These results significantly outperformed the cardiologist's clinical assessment with Romhilt-Estes point system and Cornell voltage criteria, Sokolov-Lyon criteria, and interpretation of ECG machine. At the same specificity, the AI algorithm based on ENN achieved 159.9%, 177.7%, and 143.8% higher sensitivities than those of the cardiologist's assessment, Sokolov-Lyon criteria, and interpretation of ECG machine.\nAn AI algorithm based on ENN was highly able to detect LVH and outperformed cardiologists, conventional methods, and other machine learning techniques.", "Rats make excellent models for the study of medical, biological, genetic, and behavioral phenomena given their adaptability, robustness, survivability, and intelligence. The rat's general anatomy and physiology of the auditory system is similar to that observed in humans, and this has led to their use for investigating the effect of noise overexposure on the mammalian auditory system. The current paper provides a review of the rat model for studying noise-induced hearing loss and highlights advancements that have been made using the rat, particularly as these pertain to noise dose and the hazardous effects of different experimental noise types. In addition to the traditional loss of auditory function following acoustic trauma, recent findings have indicated the rat as a useful model in observing alterations in neuronal processing within the central nervous system following noise injury. Furthermore, the rat provides a second animal model when investigating noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy, as studies examining this in the rat model resemble the general patterns observed in mice. Together, these findings demonstrate the relevance of this animal model for furthering the authors' understanding of the effects of noise on structural, anatomical, physiological, and perceptual aspects of hearing.", "Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and carotid plaque (CP) currently act as risk predictors for CVD/Stroke risk assessment. Over 2000 articles have been published that cover either use cIMT/CP or alterations of cIMT/CP and additional image-based phenotypes to associate cIMT related markers with CVD/Stroke risk. These articles have shown variable results, which likely reflect a lack of standardization in the tools for measurement, risk stratification, and risk assessment. Guidelines for cIMT/CP measurement are influenced by major factors like the atherosclerosis disease itself, conventional risk factors, 10-year measurement tools, types of CVD/Stroke risk calculators, incomplete validation of measurement tools, and the fast pace of computer technology advancements. This review discusses the following major points: 1) the American Society of Echocardiography and Mannheim guidelines for cIMT/CP measurements; 2) forces that influence the guidelines; and 3) calculators for risk stratification and assessment under the influence of advanced intelligence methods. The review also presents the knowledge-based learning strategies such as machine and deep learning which may play a future role in CVD/stroke risk assessment. We conclude that both machine learning and non-machine learning strategies will flourish for current and 10-year CVD/Stroke risk prediction as long as they integrate image-based phenotypes with conventional risk factors.", "The goal of treatment for depressive disorders is complete remission of depressive symptoms with full recovery of social function and prevention of recurrence. However, a large proportion of patients do not experience symptomatic remission after the initial treatment, with even lower rates of remission in the longer treatment term. The main objective of individualized treatment applied in psychiatry is to improve precision in disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment choices, and treatment response. Diverse approaches and techniques, such as genomics, epigenomics, other omics, neural circuit, and artificial intelligence are related to precision psychiatry. Using biology and computational psychiatry tools to find potential biomarkers, and based on precision psychiatry, patients considered to belong to the same endophenotype will be possible to receive biomarkers-based treatment and better prognosis. Especially in the choice of intervention, individualized treatment should be considered. In this review, we present the development of precise treatment in depressive disorders and introduce advances in several domains toward precision medicine and individualized treatment. We pay particular attention to biomarkers and the development of new technologies in depressive disorders, which will help disease complete remission and functional recovery, seek better lives for patients suffered with depressive disorders.", "The diagnosis of disease often requires analysis of a biopsy. Many diagnoses depend not only on the presence of certain features but on their location within the tissue. Recently, a number of deep learning diagnostic aids have been developed to classify digitized biopsy slides. Clinical workflows often involve processing of more than 500 slides per day. But, clinical use of deep learning diagnostic aids would require a preprocessing workflow that is cost-effective, flexible, scalable, rapid, interpretable, and transparent. Here, we present such a workflow, optimized using Dask and mixed precision training via APEX, capable of handling any patch-level or slide level classification and prediction problem. The workflow uses a flexible and fast preprocessing and deep learning analytics pipeline, incorporates model interpretation and has a highly storage-efficient audit trail. We demonstrate the utility of this package on the analysis of a prototypical anatomic pathology specimen, liver biopsies for evaluation of hepatitis from a prospective cohort. The preliminary data indicate that PathFlowAI may become a cost-effective and time-efficient tool for clinical use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms.", "Since the relaunch of Microsoft Academic Services (MAS) 4 years ago, scholarly communications have undergone dramatic changes: more ideas are being exchanged online, more authors are sharing their data, and more software tools used to make discoveries and reproduce the results are being distributed openly. The sheer amount of information available is overwhelming for individual humans to keep up and digest. In the meantime, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have made great strides and the cost of computing has plummeted to the extent that it has become practical to employ intelligent agents to comprehensively collect and analyze scholarly communications. MAS is one such effort and this paper describes its recent progresses since the last disclosure. As there are plenty of independent studies affirming the effectiveness of MAS, this paper focuses on the use of three key AI technologies that underlies its prowess in capturing scholarly communications with adequate quality and broad coverage: (1) natural language understanding in extracting factoids from individual articles at the web scale, (2) knowledge assisted inference and reasoning in assembling the factoids into a knowledge graph, and (3) a reinforcement learning approach to assessing scholarly importance for entities participating in scholarly communications, called the saliency, that serves both as an analytic and a predictive metric in MAS. These elements enhance the capabilities of MAS in supporting the studies of science of science based on the GOTO principle, i.e., good and open data with transparent and objective methodologies. The current direction of development and how to access the regularly updated data and tools from MAS, including the knowledge graph, a REST API and a website, are also described.", "Since the QSAR/DNN model showed predominant predictive performance over other conventional methods in the Kaggle QSAR competition, many artificial neural network (ANN) methods have been applied to drug and material discovery. Appearance of artificial intelligence (AI), which is combined various general purpose ANN platforms with large-scale open access chemical databases, has attracting great interest and expectation in a wide range of molecular sciences. In this study, we investigate various DNN settings in order to reach a high-level of predictive performance comparable to the champion team of the competition, even with a general purpose ANN platform, and introduce the Meister setting for constructing a good QSAR/DNNs model. Here, we have used the most commonly available DNN model and constructed many QSAR/DNN models trained with various DNN settings by using the 15 datasets employed in the competition. As a result, it was confirmed that we can constructed the QSAR/DNN model that shows the same level of R2 performance as the champion team. The difference from the DNN setting recommended by the champion team was to reduce the mini-batch size. We have also explained that the R2 performance of each target depends on the molecular activity type, which is related to the complexity of biological mechanisms and chemical processes observed in molecular activity measurements.", "The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) represents a widely utilized neuropsychological assessment technique for executive function. This meta-analysis examined the discriminant validity of the WCST for the assessment of mental shifting, considered as an essential subcomponent of executive functioning, against traditional psychometric intelligence tests. A systematic search was conducted, resulting in 72 neuropsychological samples for the meta-analysis of relationships between WCST scores and a variety of intelligence quotient (IQ) domains. The study revealed low to medium-sized correlations with IQ domains across all WCST scores that could be investigated. Verbal/crystallized IQ and performance/fluid IQ were indistinguishably associated with WCST scores. To conclude, the WCST assesses cognitive functions that might be partially separable from common conceptualizations of intelligence. More vigorous initiatives to validate putative indicators of executive function against intelligence are required.", "Despite accumulating evidence that culture shapes the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), no studies have yet applied the Self-Construal Scale to individuals with ASD. We compared the self-construals (measured using the Self-Construal Scale) of 31 high-functioning Japanese individuals with ASD with those of 60 typically developing (TD) individuals. We also examined how the self-construals of individuals with ASD related to their intelligence quotient, adverse childhood experiences, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ASD symptoms during adulthood and preschool years, and subjective well-being. Individuals with ASD were more likely to display independent self-construals than were TD individuals; unexpectedly, however, a substantial proportion of individuals with ASD (43.8%) displayed relatively interdependent self-construals. Among individuals with ASD, self-construals were significantly associated with ASD symptoms during preschool years, and with satisfaction of the need for autonomy and frustration of the need for relatedness. Evaluating self-construals can help predict the subjective well-being of high-functioning individuals with ASD. Moreover, the Self-Construal Scale may be useful for understanding the heterogeneous phenotypes of ASD, based on its association with autistic symptoms during preschool years, suggesting that the scale is a potential tool to develop efficient interventions for high-functioning individuals with ASD. Autism Res 2020, 13: 947-958. \u00a9 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of disorders presenting a variety of symptoms and biological origins that can complicate choosing an intervention best suited for improving well-being. Results indicate that a self-construal scale could help understand individuals with high-functioning ASD by independent and interdependent self-construals that are associated with ASD symptoms during preschool years and adult subjective well-being. Our findings suggest that this scale can help understand ASD and select appropriate interventions.", "Machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) have become important research tools in molecular medicine and chemistry. Their rise and recent success in drug discovery promises a rapid progression of development pipelines while reshaping how fundamental and clinical research is conducted. By taking advantage of the ever-growing wealth of publicly available and proprietary data, learning algorithms now provide an attractive means to generate statistically motivated research hypotheses. Hitherto unknown data patterns may guide and prioritize experiments, and augment expert intuition. Therefore, data is a key component in the model building workflow. Herein, I aim to discuss types of chemical and biological data according to their quality and reemphasize general recommendations for their use in ML/AI.", "The advances in the Internet and related technologies may lead to changes in professional roles of psychiatrists and psychotherapists. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and electronic measurement-based care (eMBC) in the treatment of depressive disorder has addressed more interest. AI could play a role in population health management and patient administration as well as assist physicians to make a decision in the real-world clinical practice. The eMBC strengthens MBC through web/mobile devices and telephone consulting services, to monitor disease progression, and customizes the MBC interface in electronic medical record systems (EMRs).", "We use central frequency ratio and noise magnitude ratio from noise power spectrum (NPS) to evaluate the noise reduction techniques of ASiR and ASiR-V of GE, SAFIRE and ADMIRE of Siemens, and PixelShine of AlgoMedica. ASiR, ASiR-V, SAFIRE and ADMIRE use a combination of image and projection data whereas PixelShine uses artificial intelligence neural network for noise reduction.\nThe homogeneous module of the ACR computed tomography (CT) phantom was scanned on a GE Revolution HD 64-slice CT for ASiR and ASiR-V, a Siemens Somatom Force for ADMIRE, and a Siemens Definition AS 64-slice for SAFIRE for NPS calculation. The baseline filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstructions were derived from the standard kernel on Revolution HD, Hr44f on Force and D40s on Definition AS. The central frequency ratio (CFR) indicates the degree of shift in the central frequency of NPS after noise reduction. A smaller CFR means a larger shift of the NPS curve, or a larger degree of image blurring. The noise magnitude ratio (NMR) indicates the amount of noise removed. A smaller NMR means a larger degree of noise reduction. An ideal noise reduction shall maintain a CFR close to 1 and a NMR close to 0.\nThe ideal noise reduction by increasing radiation exposure did not shift the central frequency when the image noise was reduced. PixelShine was the closest to the ideal noise reduction in CFR, and was followed by SAFIRE, ASiR-V, ADMIRE and ASiR, in sequence. Similarly, PixelShine had the smallest NMR, and was followed by SAFIRE, ASiR-V, ADMIRE and ASiR in sequence. Overall, PixelShine had the least central frequency shift for the same amount of noise reduction or the most noise reduction for the same amount of central frequency shift. For the same CFR, ASiR-V reduced more noise than ASiR; and SAFIRE reduced more noise than ADMIRE.\nWe introduced two new parameters of CFR and NMR from NPS to compare the reconstructions from different manufacturers. PixelShine had the least central frequency shift for the same amount of noise reduction or the most noise reduction for the same amount of central frequency shift. For the same central frequency shift, ASiR-V reduced more noise than ASiR, and SAFIRE reduced more noise than ADMIRE.", "The Miranda v. Arizona (1966) decision was intended to protect individuals' rights in custodial situations. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate Miranda abilities of individuals with intellectual disability and evaluate the utility of intelligence in predicting these abilities. Additionally, we aimed to provide an updated resource for forensic examiners regarding the performance of individuals with intellectual disability on the Standardized Assessment of Miranda Abilities (SAMA).\nWe hypothesized that IQ, particularly verbal intelligence and working memory, would significantly predict abilities related to recall, vocabulary, knowledge, and acquiescence in a sample with intellectual disability.\nSixty-two individuals diagnosed with intellectual disability completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-4th ed. (WAIS-IV), the SAMA, and a background questionnaire.\nParticipants demonstrated significantly worse Miranda abilities when compared to the normative sample of the SAMA apart from acquiescence, which they demonstrated at significantly higher rates. Participants exhibited limited existing knowledge of Miranda rights and showed minimal improvement following exposure to a Miranda warning. Verbal abilities were a significant predictor of recall and vocabulary abilities with large effect sizes on average (i.e., ds > 1). IQ was not predictive of misconceptions about Miranda or acquiescence.\nVerbal intelligence was an important contributor to understanding Miranda. This study provided data related to performance on the SAMA by a sample of individuals with intellectual disability. It may serve as a reference for evaluators, legal professionals, and law enforcement officers when working with justice-involved persons with suspected intellectual disability.

Labrador retrievers with chocolate-coloured coats are anecdotally considered to be less trainable and more hyperactive and aggressive than their black or yellow peers. To test these assertions, we analysed the owner-reported behavioural traits of Labradors in relation to both their observable coat colour, and their TYRP1 and MC1R genotypes.\nWe used the results of an owner-based questionnaire to determine scores for 21 behavioural traits and test whether these scores varied with coat colour (n\u2009=\u2009225). Familiar dog aggression was the only trait that was found to vary significantly with coat colour (P\u2009=\u20090.013). Yellow Labradors had a higher score than chocolate Labradors, even when corrected for multiple testing (P\u2009=\u20090.021).We repeated the analyses for a subset of 63 Labradors with available genotyping data for the genes (MC1R and TYRP1) that are known to determine the primary coat colours in Labradors. Familiar dog aggression scores varied with both the observed coat colour and MC1R genotype. Dogs homozygous for MC1R recessive allele (with yellow coat colour) scored higher for familiar dog aggression than either black or chocolate Labradors. However, no association maintained significance when incorporating Bonferroni correction. Dog trainability scores decreased additively as the number of recessive brown alleles for TYRP1 increased. This allelic association was independent of the observable coat colour. Dogs homozygous for the brown allele were considered less trainable than dogs with no brown alleles (P\u2009=\u20090.030).\nOur results do not support that chocolate-coloured Labradors are more hyperactive or aggressive than either black or yellow Labradors. Trainability scores varied with TYRP1 genotype but not the observable coat colour. Further validation is required.", "Speech perception and auditory processing have been shown to be enhanced among aging musicians as compared to non-musicians. In the present study, the aim was to test whether these functions are also enhanced among those who are engaged in a non-musical mentally challenging leisure activity (card playing). Three groups of 23 aging adults, aged 60-80\u00a0years, were recruited for the study: Musicians, Card players, and Controls. Participants were matched for age, gender, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III Matrix Reasoning, and Digit Span scores. Their performance was measured using auditory spectral and spatial temporal order judgment tests, and four tasks of speech perception in conditions of: no background noise, background noise of speech frequencies, background noise of white noise, and 60% compressed speech. Musicians were better in auditory and speech perception than the other two groups. Card players were similar to Controls in auditory perception tasks, but were better in the speech perception tasks. Non-musician aging adults may be able to improve their speech perception ability by engaging in leisure activity requiring cognitive effort.", "A single career in nursing may encompass numerous and very different positions. Nurses are aware they can select from a variety of specialties, as they choose to learn additional skills or pursue new opportunities. Today's nurses use their intelligence, experience, and holistic concern for all people in more diverse arenas than ever before. This article is followed by a series of first-person accounts of jobs that may not, on first consideration, look like nursing roles. These professionals have not left nursing. They have carried their healing energy, grounding in the nursing process, as well as a desire to improve the well-being of others with them, because they are nurses.", "Guided by brain-like 'spiking' computational frameworks, neuromorphic computing-brain-inspired computing for machine intelligence-promises to realize artificial intelligence while reducing the energy requirements of computing platforms. This interdisciplinary field began with the implementation of silicon circuits for biological neural routines, but has evolved to encompass the hardware implementation of algorithms with spike-based encoding and event-driven representations. Here we provide an overview of the developments in neuromorphic computing for both algorithms and hardware and highlight the fundamentals of learning and hardware frameworks. We discuss the main challenges and the future prospects of neuromorphic computing, with emphasis on\u00a0algorithm-hardware codesign.", "This study presents incremental learning based methods to personalize human activity recognition models. Initially, a user-independent model is used in the recognition process. When a new user starts to use the human activity recognition application, personal streaming data can be gathered. Of course, this data does not have labels. However, there are three different ways to obtain this data: non-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised. The non-supervised approach relies purely on predicted labels, the supervised approach uses only human intelligence to label the data, and the proposed method for semi-supervised learning is a combination of these two: It uses artificial intelligence (AI) in most cases to label the data but in uncertain cases it relies on human intelligence. After labels are obtained, the personalization process continues by using the streaming data and these labels to update the incremental learning based model, which in this case is Learn++. Learn++ is an ensemble method that can use any classifier as a base classifier, and this study compares three base classifiers: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and classification and regression tree (CART). Moreover, three datasets are used in the experiment to show how well the presented method generalizes on different datasets. The results show that personalized models are much more accurate than user-independent models. On average, the recognition rates are: 87.0% using the user-independent model, 89.1% using the non-supervised personalization approach, 94.0% using the semi-supervised personalization approach, and 96.5% using the supervised personalization approach. This means that by relying on predicted labels with high confidence, and asking the user to label only uncertain observations (6.6% of the observations when using LDA, 7.7% when using QDA, and 18.3% using CART), almost as low error rates can be achieved as by using the supervised approach, in which labeling is fully based on human intelligence.", "Stretchable sensors with multiple sensory functions are in high demand for healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence. Despite recent advances in wearable electronic sensors, it remains a significant challenge to achieve simultaneous sensing of both thermal and mechanical stimuli with a single sensor while integrating high stretchability. Herein, a stretchable and multifunctional optical sensor (SMOS) with simultaneous readout of temperature and strain is developed for wearable physiological monitoring of the human body. The SMOS primarily consists of a stretchable optical sensing fiber made from polymer nanocomposites containing lanthanide-based upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). Temperature measurements are achieved by ratiometric intensity measurements of the dual-emission UCNPs upon near-infrared excitation. By virtue of the ratiometric detection, the temperature readout of the SMOS is independent of strain deformations, enabling stable and continuous measurements of skin temperature during body motions. Furthermore, deformation of the SMOS by stretching leads to detectable and reversible changes in its light transmission, allowing tensile strains to be simultaneously measured. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the capabilities of the SMOS in real time and simultaneous detection of both skin temperature and motion activities of the human body.", "Chest X-rays are used for mass screening for the early detection of lung cancer. However, lung nodules are often overlooked because of bones overlapping the lung fields. Bone suppression techniques based on artificial intelligence have been developed to solve this problem. However, bone suppression accuracy needs improvement. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural filter (CNF) for bone suppression based on a convolutional neural network which is frequently used in the medical field and has excellent performance in image processing. CNF outputs a value for the bone component of the target pixel by inputting pixel values in the neighborhood of the target pixel. By processing all positions in the input image, a bone-extracted image is generated. Finally, bone-suppressed image is obtained by subtracting the bone-extracted image from the original chest X-ray image. Bone suppression was most accurate when using CNF with six convolutional layers, yielding bone suppression of 89.2%. In addition, abnormalities, if present, were effectively imaged by suppressing only bone components and maintaining soft-tissue. These results suggest that the chances of missing abnormalities may be reduced by using the proposed method. The proposed method is useful for bone suppression in chest X-ray images.", "This study aimed to draw a cross-task comparison on visuospatial processing in autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability. Participants with autism spectrum disorder were matched with typically developing individuals on general intelligence and perceptual reasoning index. The two groups were subsequently compared on visuospatial processing speed, visuo-perceptual, visuo-constructive, and visuospatial working memory tasks. Our results revealed similar performances between autism spectrum disorder and typically developing individuals on measures of visuospatial processing speed and visuospatial working memory. The autism spectrum disorder group showed slower reaction times than the typically developing group in the visuo-perceptual task, when stimuli were characterized by a minimum level of perceptual cohesiveness, revealing weaker spatial integration abilities. Concerning the visuo-constructive domain, no differences between the autism spectrum disorder and the typically developing group emerged for the unsegmented condition, revealing that our participants with autism spectrum disorder were similar to the typically developing group in the local analysis of the stimuli. The discussion takes into account the role of individual differences on visuospatial intelligence, task requirements, and cognitive domains to clarify the visuospatial processing skills of individuals with autism spectrum disorder.", "Autistic adults receive unfavorable first impressions from typically developing (TD) adults, but these impressions improve when TD adults are made aware of their diagnosis. It remains unclear, however, how autistic adults form first impressions of other autistic adults, and whether their impressions are similarly affected by diagnostic awareness.\nIn this study, 32 autistic and 32 TD adults viewed brief videos of 20 TD and 20 autistic adults presented either with or without their diagnostic status and rated them on character traits and their interest in interacting with them in the future.\nFindings indicated that autistic raters shared the TD tendency to evaluate autistic adults less favorably than TD adults, but these judgments did not reduce their social interest for interacting with autistic adults as they did for TD raters. Furthermore, informing raters of the diagnostic status of autistic adults did not improve first impressions for autistic raters as they did for TD raters, suggesting that autistic raters either already inferred their autism status when no diagnosis was provided or their impression formation is less affected by awareness of a person's diagnosis.\nCollectively, these results demonstrate that autistic observers make trait inferences about autistic adults comparable with those made by TD observers-suggesting a similar sensitivity to perceiving and interpreting social signifiers that differ between TD and autistic presentation styles-but unlike their TD counterparts, these trait judgments are not perceived as an impediment to subsequent social interaction and are relatively consistent regardless of diagnostic disclosure.\nWhy was this study done?: Typically developing (TD) adults often form negative first impressions of autistic adults and report less of a desire to interact with them. These biases affect the social experiences of autistic adults and can contribute to their social disability. More optimistically, however, first impressions of autistic adults improve when TD adults are more knowledgeable about autism and are made aware of their diagnostic status, suggesting that familiarity and understanding can promote acceptance of autistic differences. One group that has high familiarity with autism is autistic adults themselves, but no study to date has examined how autistic adults form impressions of TD adults and other autistic adults.What was the purpose of this study?: The purpose of this study was to examine whether first impressions of, and social interest in, autistic adults differ between autistic and TD raters, and determine whether disclosure of a person's diagnosis affects these patterns differently for autistic and TD raters.What did the researchers do?: A total of 32 TD and 32 autistic adult raters viewed videos of 40 unfamiliar adults (20 TD and 20 autistic individuals) and rated each person on six traits (awkwardness, attractiveness, assertiveness, likeability, trustworthiness, and intelligence) and four items assessing their social interest in future interaction with the person in the video. Videos were presented either with or without the person's diagnosis to see whether this information affects impressions formed by autistic and TD raters.What were the results of the study?: Consistent with prior work, TD raters formed more negative first impressions of autistic adults than TD adults. Meanwhile, autistic raters formed more positive impressions overall, but shared the TD pattern of rating autistic adults less favorably than TD adults on several traits. However, contrary to theories about reduced social motivation in autism, autistic raters expressed greater interest than TD raters in future interaction with people in the videos and this social interest was largest for other autistic people. Finally, diagnostic disclosure improved impressions of autistic adults made by TD raters but not by autistic raters.What do these findings add to what was already known?: These findings provide empirical evidence that autistic adults detect and interpret autistic social differences similarly to TD adults, but they express greater inclusivity and less discriminatory attitudes about these differences. These results add to a growing literature about how autistic people are perceived, how these perceptions affect their social experiences, and how similarity between social partners can support social connection.What are potential weaknesses in the study?: The included sample was predominantly Caucasian and male, and did not include participants with intellectual disability. Future studies should examine whether the patterns here extend to more diverse samples.How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future?: This study provides additional evidence that social opportunities for autistic adults are affected by the perceptions and biases of potential social partners. Autistic observers may share the TD bias toward less favorable trait evaluation of autistic adults, but this did not lessen their social interest in interacting with autistic adults the way it did for TD observers. Opportunities for autistic adults to interact with other autistic adults may facilitate relationship development in this population who often struggle to have their social needs met. In addition, findings suggest that acceptance of autistic people increases with familiarity of autism itself. Improving attitudes about autism among TD people may be one effective way to improve the social experiences of autistic people within neurotypical environments.", "Brette contends that the neural coding metaphor is an invalid basis for theories of what the brain does. Here, we argue that it is an insufficient guide for building an artificial intelligence that learns to accomplish short- and long-term goals in a complex, changing environment.", "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a widely prevalent disorder that can affect cognitive function. The relationship between cognitive function and OSA is known to be affected by an individual's premorbid cognitive ability. Tools to measure premorbid intelligence across OSA disease severity have not been validated. This brief report aims to establish if the National Adult Reading Test (NART) provides a stable estimate of premorbid intelligence across levels of OSA disease severity. We examined if NART scores varied systematically across levels of untreated OSA severity (defined according to the apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) and mean oxygen saturation in sleep clinic (n\u00a0=\u00a0121) and community samples (n\u00a0=\u00a0398) using regression analysis. Simple linear regression was used to predict NART scores based on the AHI. NART-estimated premorbid IQ scores without demographics did not vary systematically with AHI (F\u00a0<\u00a01; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.01) or mean SpO2 (F\u00a0<\u00a01; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.12). NART-estimated premorbid IQ scores with added demographic information also did not vary systematically with AHI (F\u00a0<\u00a01; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.01) or mean SpO2 (F\u00a0<\u00a01; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.15). This preliminary examination shows that the NART provides a stable estimate of premorbid intelligence across untreated OSA disease severity, as demarcated by AHI or mean nocturnal SpO2 .", "In 1932 and again in 1947, the Scottish Council for Research in Education conducted the Scottish Mental Surveys. Testing two cohorts, one in 1932 and another in 1947, researchers set out to measure-using the same validated test each time-the intelligence of every Scottish child 11\u2009years of age. The stated impetus for the Surveys was a fear that average Scottish intelligence was declining. But when investigators compared the results of the 1947 Survey with those from 1932 their predictions were completely upended. Instead of average intelligence declining, it had risen, substantially. The author argues that based on a study of the relevant ecosystems in place in Scotland at the time the increase in intelligence resulted from a decline in lead body burden. There is no evidence that the children were tested for lead. The decline is thought to have closely followed a fall in occupational lead use, a heightened awareness of the dangers of lead-solvency, improvements in lead plumbing in working-class homes, and a national campaign to improve the nutrition of women and children. Evidence shows that milk consumption in Scotland increased sharply, especially among children, beginning in the mid-1930s, just prior to and following the birth of the second cohort. This provided a source of calcium in a diet that had shown signs of deficiency. Evidence also suggests that lead contamination, from lead water pipes and industrial sources, was widely prevalent in Scotland in the early part of the twentieth century.", "Most colorectal polyps are diminutive, and malignant potential for these polyps is uncommon, especially for those in the rectosigmoid. However, many diminutive polyps are still being resected to determine whether these are adenomas or serrated/hyperplastic polyps. Resecting all the diminutive polyps is not cost-effective. Therefore, gastroenterologists have proposed optical diagnosis using image-enhanced endoscopy for polyp characterization. These technologies have achieved favorable outcomes, but are not widely available. Artificial intelligence has been used in clinical medicine to classify lesions. Here, artificial intelligence technology for the characterization of colorectal polyps is discussed in a decision-making context regarding diminutive colorectal polyps.", "The amount of data collected and managed in (bio)medicine is ever-increasing. Thus, there is a need to rapidly and efficiently collect, analyze, and characterize all this information. Artificial intelligence (AI), with an emphasis on deep learning, holds great promise in this area and is already being successfully applied to basic research, diagnosis, drug discovery, and clinical trials. Rare diseases (RDs), which are severely underrepresented in basic and clinical research, can particularly benefit from AI technologies. Of the more than 7000 RDs described worldwide, only 5% have a treatment. The ability of AI technologies to integrate and analyze data from different sources (e.g., multi-omics, patient registries, and so on) can be used to overcome RDs' challenges (e.g., low diagnostic rates, reduced number of patients, geographical dispersion, and so on). Ultimately, RDs' AI-mediated knowledge could significantly boost therapy development. Presently, there are AI approaches being used in RDs and this review aims to collect and summarize these advances. A section dedicated to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), a particular group of orphan RDs that can serve as a potential study model for other common diseases and RDs, has also been included.", "Flexible endoscopes became generally available 50\u00a0years ago and created a revolution in the practice of gastroenterology. They improved diagnosis enormously, enabled quicker, less invasive, and more cost-effective surgical treatment, while endoscopic screening has prevented many cancer deaths. The new technology stimulated research leading to a better understanding of gastrointestinal pathology, identifying new diseases and clarifying the etiology of others. Better-controlled clinical trials accelerated the use of newer and more effective drugs. National and international endoscopy societies supported nursing input, encouraged research, stimulated specialist journals, and devised guidelines that encouraged audit and quality assurance. Advances in instrument design and the manufacture of new accessories enhanced endoscopic technique, diagnostic ability, patient comfort, and safety. The risk of cross-infection inherent in the use of complex labile equipment that cannot be autoclaved remains a challenge. Endoscopy societies working closely with industry have established rigid protocols for high-level disinfection that minimize the risks, but strict adherence to guidelines and continued vigilance is essential, especially with the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant commensals that can give rise to opportunistic infection. Government health departments have a responsibility to encourage and support research in this area by endoscopists, instrument manufacturers, and the pharmaceutical industry. Current trends suggest that in the future, artificial intelligence will greatly improve endoscopic diagnosis, and that therapeutic endoscopy will expand, encouraging endoscopists to subspecialize.", "The aim of this review is to highlight novel artificial intelligence-based methods for the detection of optic disc abnormalities, with particular focus on neurology and neuro-ophthalmology.\nMethods for detection of optic disc abnormalities on retinal fundus images have evolved considerably over the last few years, from classical ophthalmoscopy to artificial intelligence-based identification methods being applied to retinal imaging with the aim of predicting sight and life-threatening complications of underlying brain or optic nerve conditions.\nArtificial intelligence and in particular newly developed deep-learning systems are playing an increasingly important role for the detection and classification of acquired neuro-ophthalmic optic disc abnormalities on ocular fundus images. The implementation of automatic deep-learning methods for detection of abnormal optic discs, coupled with innovative hardware solutions for fundus imaging, could revolutionize the practice of neurologists and other non-ophthalmic healthcare providers.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to impact almost every aspect of health care, from detection to prediction and prevention. The adoption of new technologies in health care, however, lags far behind the emergence of new technologies. Health care professionals and organizations must be prepared to change and evolve to adopt these new technologies. A basic understanding of emerging AI technologies will be essential for all health care professionals. These technologies include expert systems, robotic process automation, natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning. Health care professionals and organizations must build their capacity and capabilities to understand and appropriately adopt these technologies. This understanding starts with basic AI literacy, including data governance principles, basic statistics, data visualization, and the impact on clinical processes. Health care professionals and organizations will need to overcome several challenges and tackle core structural issues, such as access to data and the readiness of algorithms for clinical practice. However, health care professionals have an opportunity to shape the way that AI will be used and the outcomes that will be achieved. There is an urgent and emerging need for education and training so that appropriate technologies can be rapidly adopted, resulting in a healthier world for our patients and our communities.", "Background: Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (Microcephaly Primary Hereditary, MCPH) is a rare disorder, affecting 1 in 10,000 children in areas where consanguineous marriages are common. WDR62 gene mutations are the second most common cause of MCPH. Herein, we report a case of primary microcephaly caused by two novel WDR62 mutations, which is, to our knowledge, the first such case report in East Asia. Case presentation: A 6-year-old girl visited our outpatient clinic as a result of microcephaly and delayed development. The patient was born at 36 weeks 4 days through cesarean section. Her birth weight was 1.8 kg (<1st percentile), and she was noted to have microcephaly (head circumference at birth was 28 cm, <-3SD). On examination, delayed speech development and microcephaly with an occipitofrontal head circumference of 43.5 cm (<-3SD) were noted. The patient's gross and fine motor development was normal. Her intelligence quotient was 43 (<0.1 percentile), the same as a 27-month-old child, and her social intelligence quotient was 76.92. Brain imaging revealed simplified gyral patterns of the cerebral cortex; however, laboratory findings, including organic acids, were normal. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification technique for microdeletion syndrome and chromosomal microarray, showed no abnormality. Clinical exome sequencing test revealed two novel heterozygous variants in the WDR62 gene at two different sites: in the boundary of intron 7 and exon 8 (NM_001083961.1: c.883-4_890del) and in exon 13 (NM_001083961.1: c.1684C>G). The patient's parents were identified as heterozygous carriers for each variation. Conclusion: We report on two novel heterozygous mutations in East Asia. Our data expand the understanding of WDR62 mutations.", "Fog is an important component of the water cycle in northern coastal regions of Iran. Having accurate tools for mapping the precise spatial distribution of fog is vital for water harvesting within integrated water resources management in this semi-humid region. In this study, environmental variables were considered in prediction mapping of areas with high concentrations of fog in the Vazroud watershed, Iran. Fog probability maps were derived from four artificial intelligence algorithms (Generalized Linear Model, Generalized Additive Model, Generalized Boosted Model, and Generalized Dissimilarity Model). Models accuracy were assessed using Receiver Operating characteristic Curve (ROC). Three social variables were also selected according to their relevance for fog suitability mapping. Finally, Fog-water harvesting Capability Index (FCI) maps were produced by multiplying fog probability by fog suitability maps. The results showed high accuracy in fog probability mapping for the study area, with all models proving capable of identifying areas with high fog concentrations in the south and southeast. For all models, the highest values of importance were obtained for sky view factor and the lowest for slope curvature. Analytic Hierarchy Process results showed the relative importance of social conditioning factors in fog suitability mapping, with the highest weight given to distance to residential area, followed by distance to livestock buildings and distance to road. Based on the fog suitability map, southeast and southern parts of the study area are most suitable for fog water harvesting. The fog spatial distribution maps obtained can increase fog water harvesting efficiency. They also indicate areas for future study with regions where fog is a critical component in the water cycle.", "Numerous recent technological advances offer the potential to substantially enhance the MRI evaluation of moyamoya disease (MMD). These include high-resolution volumetric imaging, high-resolution vessel wall characterization, improved cerebral angiographic and perfusion techniques, high-field imaging, fast scanning methods, and artificial intelligence. This review discusses the current state-of-the-art MRI applications in these realms, emphasizing key imaging findings, clinical utility, and areas that will benefit from further investigation. Although these techniques may apply to imaging of a wide array of neurovascular or other neurological conditions, consideration of their application to MMD is useful given the comprehensive multidimensional MRI assessment used to evaluate MMD. These MRI techniques span from basic cross-sectional to advanced functional sequences, both qualitative and quantitative.The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive summary and analysis of current key relevant literature of advanced MRI techniques for the evaluation of MMD with image-rich case examples. These imaging methods can aid clinical characterization, help direct treatment, assist in the evaluation of treatment response, and potentially improve the understanding of the pathophysiology of MMD.", "Crime-scenes are the heart of any investigation in terms of recovery of key forensic evidence - fingermarks and DNA. Yet, quite often, the operational work of the forensic units, in which different chemicals and reagents for fingermarks development are applied, can also be highly destructive to the property and the environment. Hence, for both ecological and intelligence purposes, an operational method that minimizes that damage would be ideal. In this study, an \"out-of-the-box\" approach is proposed; rather than working at the crime scene itself, gel-lifters were used as a transferring tool for the latent forensic evidence, fingermarks and DNA, to be developed by applying black wet-powder (Wetwop\u00ae) in a controlled laboratory environment, leaving the crime-scene undisturbed. The results show a promising potential, as this indirect method proved to be robust and successful for non-porous surfaces, and even for aged fingermarks. In addition, this study gave a new perspective into the accepted notion regarding the difference between male and female donors, showing a direct correlation of the size and weight of the hands to the natural pressure applied by the donor. Moreover, the indirect nature of the method highlights the importance of the interaction between the type of surface and the latent fingermark constituents, primarily water, and its effect on the survivability and quality of the developed fingermark. Due to the growing demand of keeping crime scenes and exhibits unharmed by both police and intelligence forces, the new approach of this application provides a valuable asset for future operational field-work.", "To compare the predictive value of the Spanish Ages & Stages Questionnaire third edition adapted for Chilean population (ASQ-Cl) and the Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development 3rd edition (Bayley-III) for cognitive delay at school age, and to identify the domain predictors.\nData were collected from 306 term and preterm children of medium-high socio-economic level enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Developmental outcomes at 8, 18 and 30\u202fmonths were assessed via the ASQ-Cl and Bayley-III; at 6-8\u202fyears cognitive development was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III). The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated, and logistic regression analysis was used.\nOf 227 children studied, 6.6% had cognitive delay. ASQ-Cl and Bayley-III generate equivalent AUC [0.77 and 0.80]. Sensitivity 67% and 53%; specificity of 72% and 88%, positive predictive value of 14% and 24%, negative predictive values of 97% and 96% respectively. Greater predictive validity was obtained at 30\u202fmonths assessment. Deficit in the communication and gross motor skills and problem-solving domains of the ASQ-Cl and all the Bayley-III domains were significantly associated with cognitive delay.\nASQ-Cl can be used to identify children at risk for cognitive delay at 6-8\u202fyears of age, being comparable with the Bayley-III. Some domains of ASQ-Cl and all domains of Bayley-III were significant predictors for cognitive delay. These results support the use of ASQ-Cl as a screening tool for developmental delay.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool in many fields, including drug discovery. Among various AI applications, molecular property prediction can have more significant immediate impact to the drug discovery process since most algorithms and methods use predicted properties to evaluate, select, and generate molecules. Herein, we provide a brief review of the state-of-art molecular property prediction methodologies and discuss examples reported recently. We highlight key techniques that have been applied to molecular property prediction such as learned representation, multi-task learning, transfer learning, and federated learning. We also point out some critical but less discussed issues such as data set quality, benchmark, model performance evaluation, and prediction confidence quantification.", "The brain capacity of human ancestors underwent two phase transitions, which were supported by preadaptations during the animal protolanguage period, resulting in the emergence of human language. The transitions were (1) the emergence of the primate cerebral cortex, with its unique characteristic of additional cortical areas together with size expansion, and (2) the replacement of natural selection as the main evolutionary mechanism by triadic niche construction, an interactive expansion of ecological-, neural-, and cognitive-niches. These phase transitions accelerated the expansion of the hominid brain, exceeding the neural capacity threshold required for the emergence of language. Extrapolating these developments enabled the researchers to predict a third phase transition, which may be induced by the current explosion of artificial intelligence, accelerating human cognitive capacities to the next threshold required for a novel mode of language.", "The associations between indices of brain structure and measured intelligence are unclear. This is partly because the evidence to-date comes from mostly small and heterogeneous studies. Here, we report brain structure-intelligence associations on a large sample from the UK Biobank study. The overall N\u202f=\u202f29,004, with N\u202f=\u202f18,426 participants providing both brain MRI and at least one cognitive test, and a complete four-test battery with MRI data available in a minimum N\u202f=\u202f7201, depending upon the MRI measure. Participants' age range was 44-81\u202fyears (M\u202f=\u202f63.13, SD\u202f=\u202f7.48). A general factor of intelligence (g) was derived from four varied cognitive tests, accounting for one third of the variance in the cognitive test scores. The association between (age- and sex- corrected) total brain volume and a latent factor of general intelligence is r\u202f=\u202f0.276, 95% C.I.\u202f=\u202f[0.252, 0.300]. A model that incorporated multiple global measures of grey and white matter macro- and microstructure accounted for more than double the g variance in older participants compared to those in middle-age (13.6% and 5. 4%, respectively). There were no sex differences in the magnitude of associations between g and total brain volume or other global aspects of brain structure. The largest brain regional correlates of g were volumes of the insula, frontal, anterior/superior and medial temporal, posterior and paracingulate, lateral occipital cortices, thalamic volume, and the white matter microstructure of thalamic and association fibres, and of the forceps minor. Many of these regions exhibited unique contributions to intelligence, and showed highly stable out of sample prediction.", "to investigate emotional intelligence (EI) and its relationship to nursing leadership.\nstrong, effective leadership is core to organisational competency and significantly influences care quality. EI is the ability to understand one's own feelings and to assess and respond to the feelings of others. It is linked to self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and social skills, all of which are vital in leadership roles. However, insufficient research explores EI in nursing leadership from the perspective of nurse leaders.\na qualitative study employed interpretive phenomenological analysis methods, using a purposive sample of band 7 sisters/charge nurses/team managers (n=5) from one Welsh health board. Semistructured interviews were recorded and analysed in four stages.\nfour clusters of themes were identified, each with two to three subthemes. These were: sensing others-the empathetic leader; experiencing the affected sense of self; strategies employed to build the team; and reading the flux of the organisation.\nalthough the nurse leaders were unfamiliar with the concept of EI, their narratives reflected some core values of EI. However, significant barriers around time, pressure and staffing levels impeded their potential to use EI to become more effective leaders. Nurse leaders should harness the power of emotions to influence others to achieve excellent care.", "The quality of bowel preparation is an important factor that can affect the effectiveness of a colonoscopy. Several tools, such as the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) and Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale, have been developed to evaluate bowel preparation. However, understanding the differences between evaluation methods and consistently applying them can be challenging for endoscopists. There are also subjective biases and differences among endoscopists. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a novel, objective, and stable method for the assessment of bowel preparation through artificial intelligence.\nWe used a deep convolutional neural network to develop this novel system. First, we retrospectively collected colonoscopy images to train the system and then compared its performance with endoscopists via a human-machine contest. Then, we applied this model to colonoscopy videos and developed a system named ENDOANGEL to provide bowel preparation scores every 30 seconds and to show the cumulative ratio of frames for each score during the withdrawal phase of the colonoscopy.\nENDOANGEL achieved 93.33% accuracy in the human-machine contest with 120 images, which was better than that of all endoscopists. Moreover, ENDOANGEL achieved 80.00% accuracy among 100 images with bubbles. In 20 colonoscopy videos, accuracy was 89.04%, and ENDOANGEL continuously showed the accumulated percentage of the images for different BBPS scores during the withdrawal phase and prompted us for bowel preparation scores every 30 seconds.\nWe provided a novel and more accurate evaluation method for bowel preparation and developed an objective and stable system-ENDOANGEL-that could be applied reliably and steadily in clinical settings.", "To investigate the feasibility of a novel method using artificial intelligence (AI), in which the fibrinogen criterion was determined by the quantitative relation between the distributions of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) and fibrinogen.\nA dataset of 154 deliveries comprising more than 2000\u2009g of blood lost due to hemorrhage, excluding disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), among patients from eight national perinatal centers in Japan from 2011 to 2015 were obtained. The fibrinogen threshold criterion was identified by using the function that best fit the distributions of FDP as determined by AI. FDP production was described by differential equations using a dataset containing fibrinogen levels less than the fibrinogen criterion and solved numerically.\nA fibrinogen level of 237\u2009mg/dL as the threshold criterion was obtained. The FDP threshold criteria were 2.0 and 8.5\u2009mg/dL for no coagulopathy and a failed coagulation system, respectively.\nThe fibrinogen threshold criterion for patients with massive hemorrhage excluding DIC at delivery were obtained by selecting the functions that best fit the distributions of FDP data by using AI.", "The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has increased significantly in recent years. With the development of artificial intelligence applications in healthcare, they are used for diagnosis, therapeutic decision making, and outcome prediction, especially in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to identify the artificial intelligence (AI) applications for type 2 diabetes mellitus care.\nThis is a review conducted in 2018. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase scientific databases, based on a combination of related mesh terms. The article selection process was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Finally, 31 articles were selected after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Data gathering was done by using a data extraction form. Data were summarized and reported based on the study objectives.\nThe main applications of AI for type 2 diabetes mellitus care were screening and diagnosis in different stages. Among all of the reviewed AI methods, machine learning methods with 71% (n = 22) were the most commonly applied techniques. Many applications were in multi method forms (23%). Among the machine learning algorithms applications, support vector machine (21%) and naive Bayesian (19%) were the most commonly used methods. The most important variables that were used in the selected studies were body mass index, fasting blood sugar, blood pressure, HbA1c, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and demographic variables.\nIt is recommended to select optimal algorithms by testing various techniques. Support vector machine and naive Bayesian might achieve better performance than other applications due to the type of variables and targets in diabetes-related outcomes classification.", "Cognition in absence epilepsy (AE) is generally considered undisturbed. However, reports on cognitive deficits in AE in recent years have suggested otherwise. This review systematically assesses current literature on cognitive performance in children with AE. A systematic literature search was performed in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science. All studies reporting on cognitive performance in children with AE were considered. In total 33 studies were eligible for inclusion. Neuropsychological tests were classified into the following domains: intelligence; executive function; attention; language; motor & sensory-perceptual examinations; visuoperceptual/visuospatial/visuoconstructional function; memory and learning; achievement. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted by estimating the pooled mean and/or pooling the mean difference in case-control studies. Full-scale IQ in children with AE was estimated at 96.78 (95%CI:94.46-99.10) across all available studies and in case-control studies IQ was on average 8.03 (95%CI:-10.45- -5.61) lower. Verbal IQ was estimated at 97.98 (95%CI:95.80-100.16) for all studies and 9.01 (95%CI:12.11- -5.90) points lower in case-control studies. Performance IQ was estimated at 97.23 (93.24-101.22) for all available studies and 5.32 (95%CI:-8.27-2.36) points lower in case-control studies. Lower performance was most often reported in executive function (cognitive flexibility, planning, and verbal fluency) and attention (sustained, selective and divided attention). Reports on school difficulties, neurodevelopmental problems, and attentional problems were high. In conclusion, in contrast to common beliefs, lower than average neurocognitive performance was noted in multiple cognitive domains, which may influence academic and psychosocial development.", "The ability to write DNA code from scratch will allow for the discovery of new and interesting chemistries as well as allowing the rewiring of cell signal pathways. Herein, we have utilized synthetic evolution artificial intelligence (SYN-AI) to intelligently design a set of 14-3-3 docking genes. SYN-AI engineers synthetic genes utilizing a parental gene as an evolution template. Wherein, evolution is fast-forwarded by transforming template gene sequences to DNA secondary and tertiary codes based upon gene hierarchical structural levels. The DNA secondary code allows identification of genomic building blocks across an orthologous sequence space comprising multiple genomes. Where, the DNA tertiary code allows engineering of supersecondary structures. SYN-AI constructed a library of 10 million genes that was reduced to three structurally functional 14-3-3 docking genes by applying natural selection protocols. Synthetic protein identity was verified utilizing Clustal Omega sequence alignments and Phylogeny.fr phylogenetic analysis. Wherein, we were able to confirm the three-dimensional structure utilizing I-TASSER and protein-ligand interactions utilizing COACH and Cofactor. The conservation of allosteric communications was confirmed utilizing elastic and anisotropic network models. Whereby, we utilized elNemo and ANM2.1 to confirm conservation of the 14-3-3 \u03b6 amphipathic groove. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first 14-3-3 docking genes to be written from scratch.", "Unplanned preventable hospital readmissions within 30 days are a great burden to patients and the healthcare system. With an estimated $41.3 billion spent yearly, reducing such readmission rates is of the utmost importance. With the widespread adoption of big data and machine learning, clinicians can use these analytical tools to understand these complex relationships and find predictive factors that can be generalized to future patients. The object of this study was to assess the efficacy of a machine learning algorithm in the prediction of 30-day hospital readmission after posterior spinal fusion surgery.\nThe authors analyzed the distribution of National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) posterior lumbar fusions from 2011 to 2016 by using machine learning techniques to create a model predictive of hospital readmissions. A deep neural network was trained using 177 unique input variables. The model was trained and tested using cross-validation, in which the data were randomly partitioned into training (n = 17,448 [75%]) and testing (n = 5816 [25%]) data sets. In training, the 17,448 training cases were fed through a series of 7 layers, each with varying degrees of forward and backward communicating nodes (neurons).\nMean and median positive predictive values were 78.5% and 78.0%, respectively. Mean and median negative predictive values were both 97%, respectively. Mean and median areas under the curve for the model were 0.812 and 0.810, respectively. The five most heavily weighted inputs were (in order of importance) return to the operating room, septic shock, superficial surgical site infection, sepsis, and being on a ventilator for > 48 hours.\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence are powerful tools with the ability to improve understanding of predictive metrics in clinical spine surgery. The authors' model was able to predict those patients who would not require readmission. Similarly, the majority of predicted readmissions (up to 60%) were predicted by the model while retaining a 0% false-positive rate. Such findings suggest a possible need for reevaluation of the current Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program penalties in spine surgery.", "Diagnostic tests, such as Immunoscore, predict prognosis in patients with colon cancer. However, additional prognostic markers could be detected on pathological slides using artificial intelligence tools.\nWe have developed a software to detect colon tumour, healthy mucosa, stroma and immune cells on CD3 and CD8 stained slides. The lymphocyte density and surface area were quantified automatically in the tumour core (TC) and invasive margin (IM). Using a LASSO algorithm, DGMate (DiGital tuMor pArameTErs), we detected digital parameters within the tumour cells related to patient outcomes.\nWithin the dataset of 1018 patients, we observed that a poorer relapse-free survival (RFS) was associated with high IM stromal area (HR 5.65; 95%\u2009CI 2.34 to 13.67; p<0.0001) and high DGMate (HR 2.72; 95% CI 1.92 to 3.85; p<0.001). Higher CD3+ TC, CD3+ IM and CD8+ TC densities were significantly associated with a longer RFS. Analysis of variance showed that CD3+ TC yielded a similar prognostic value to the classical CD3/CD8 Immunoscore (p=0.44). A combination of the IM stromal area, DGMate and CD3, designated 'DGMuneS', outperformed Immunoscore when used in estimating patients' prognosis (C-index=0.601 vs 0.578, p=0.04) and was independently associated with patient outcomes following Cox multivariate analysis. A predictive nomogram based on DGMuneS and clinical variables identified a group of patients with less than 10% relapse risk and another group with a 50% relapse risk.\nThese findings suggest that artificial intelligence can potentially improve patient care by assisting pathologists in better defining stage III colon cancer patients' prognosis.", "The term \"artificial intelligence\" (AI) includes computational algorithms that can perform tasks considered typical of human intelligence, with partial to complete autonomy, to produce new beneficial outputs from specific inputs. The development of AI is largely based on the introduction of artificial neural networks (ANN) that allowed the introduction of the concepts of \"computational learning models,\" machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). AI applications appear promising for radiology scenarios potentially improving lesion detection, segmentation, and interpretation with a recent application also for interventional radiology (IR) practice, including the ability of AI to offer prognostic information to both patients and physicians about interventional oncology procedures. This article integrates evidence-reported literature and experience-based perceptions to assist not only residents and fellows who are training in interventional radiology but also practicing colleagues who are approaching to locoregional mini-invasive treatments.", "Introduction: Among the Gastrointestinal (GI) Endoscopy Editorial Board top 10 topics in advances in endoscopy in 2018, water exchange colonoscopy and artificial intelligence were both considered important advances. Artificial intelligence holds the potential to increase and water exchange significantly increases adenoma detection.Areas covered: The authors searched MEDLINE (1998-2019) using the following medical subject terms: water-aided, water-assisted and water exchange colonoscopy, adenoma, artificial intelligence, deep learning, computer-assisted detection, and neural networks. Additional related studies were manually searched from the reference lists of publications. Only fully published journal articles in English were reviewed. The latest date of the search was Aug10, 2019. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning contribute to the promise of real-time computer-aided detection diagnosis. By emphasizing near-complete suction of infused water during insertion, water exchange provides salvage cleaning and decreases cleaning-related multi-tasking distractions during withdrawal, increasing adenoma detection. The review will address how artificial intelligence and water exchange can complement each other in improving adenoma detection during colonoscopy.Expert opinion: In 5 years, research on artificial intelligence will likely achieve real-time application and evaluation of factors contributing to quality colonoscopy. Better understanding and more widespread use of water exchange will be possible.", "Investigating the contribution of biology to human cognition has assumed a bottom-up causal cascade where genes influence brain systems that activate, communicate, and ultimately drive behavior. Yet few studies have directly tested whether cognitive traits with overlapping genetic underpinnings also rely on overlapping brain systems. Here, we report a step-wise exploratory analysis of genetic and functional imaging overlaps among cognitive traits. We used twin-based genetic analyses in the human connectome project (HCP) dataset (N\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b486), in which we quantified the heritability of measures of cognitive functions, and tested whether they were driven by common genetic factors using pairwise genetic correlations. Subsequently, we derived activation maps associated with cognitive tasks via functional imaging meta-analysis in BrainMap (N\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b4484), and tested whether cognitive traits that shared genetic variation also exhibited overlapping brain activation. Our genetic analysis determined that six cognitive measures (cognitive flexibility, no-go continuous performance, fluid intelligence, processing speed, reading decoding and vocabulary comprehension) were heritable (0.3\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200bh2\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.5), and genetically correlated with at least one other heritable cognitive measure (0.2\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b\u03c1g\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.35). The meta-analysis showed that two genetically-correlated traits, cognitive flexibility and fluid intelligence (\u03c1g\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.24), also had a significant brain activation overlap (\u03c1perm\u00a0\u200b=\u00a0\u200b0.29). These findings indicate that fluid intelligence and cognitive flexibility rely on overlapping biological features, both at the neural systems level and at the molecular level. The cross-disciplinary approach we introduce provides a concrete framework for data-driven quantification of biological convergence between genetics, brain function, and behavior in health and disease.", "Quality control, mainly focused on the assessment of bubble and foam-related parameters, is critical in carbonated beverages, due to their relationship with the chemical components as well as their influence on sensory characteristics such as aroma release, mouthfeel, and perception of tastes and aromas. Consumer assessment and acceptability of carbonated beverages are mainly based on carbonation, foam, and bubbles, as a flat carbonated beverage is usually perceived as low quality. This review focuses on three beverages: beer, sparkling water, and sparkling wine. It explains the characteristics of foam and bubble formation, and the traditional methods, as well as emerging technologies based on robotics and computer vision, to assess bubble and foam-related parameters. Furthermore, it explores the most common methods and the use of advanced techniques using an artificial intelligence approach to assess sensory descriptors both for descriptive analysis and consumers' acceptability. Emerging technologies, based on the combination of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning as an approach to artificial intelligence, have been developed and applied for the assessment of beer and, to a lesser extent, sparkling wine. This, has the objective of assessing the final products quality using more reliable, accurate, affordable, and less time-consuming methods. However, despite carbonated water being an important product, due to its increasing consumption, more research needs to focus on exploring more efficient, repeatable, and accurate methods to assess carbonation and bubble size, distribution and dynamics.", "The definition of sepsis continues to be as dynamic as the management strategies used to treat this. Sepsis-3 has replaced the earlier systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)-based diagnoses with the rapid Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score assisting in predicting overall prognosis with regards to mortality. Surgeons have an important role in ensuring adequate source control while recognizing the threat of carbapenem-resistance in gram-negative organisms. Rapid diagnostic tests are being used increasingly for the early identification of multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDROs), with a key emphasis on the multidisciplinary alert of results. Novel, higher generation antibiotic agents have been developed for resistance in ESKCAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) organisms while surgeons have an important role in the prevention of spread. The Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy (STOP-IT) trial has challenged the previous paradigm of length of antibiotic treatment whereas biomarkers such as procalcitonin are playing a prominent role in individualizing therapy. Several novel therapies for refractory septic shock, while still investigational, are gaining prominence rapidly (such as vitamin C) whereas others await further clinical trials. Management strategies presented as care bundles continue to be updated by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, yet still remain controversial in its global adoption. We have broadened our temporal and epidemiologic perspective of sepsis by understanding it both as an acute, time-sensitive, life-threatening illness to a chronic condition that increases the risk of mortality up to five years post-discharge. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and bedside scoring systems can assist the clinician in predicting post-operative sepsis. The public health role of the surgeon is key. This includes collaboration and multi-disciplinary antibiotic stewardship at a hospital level. It also requires controlling pharmaceutical sales and the unregulated dispensing of antibiotic agents globally through policy initiatives to control emerging resistance through prevention.", "Navel orange is a very popular fruit which is rich in nutrition necessary to human health. Nowadays, rapid, nondestructive and pollution-free analysis of internal organic compounds of fruit is an important and promising technology. The purpose of this paper is to present a swarm intelligence optimization method to extract the feature information of visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectra of navel orange for rapid and nondestructive analysis of soluble solid content (SSC) in navel orange. This method was developed on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and named as piecewise particle swarm optimization (PPSO). The experimental results showed that the PPSO algorithm proposed in this paper overcame the disadvantage of PSO's premature convergence. The PLS model based on variables selected by PPSO for nondestructively detecting SSC of navel orange yield promising results, as the standard deviation of prediction (SEP) was 0.427\u00b0Brix while the standard error of laboratory (SEL) was 0.22\u00b0Brix. It indicated that the application of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology combined with PPSO for rapid analysis of soluble solid content in navel orange was feasible.", "The Internet of Things has grown quickly in the last few years, with a variety of sensing, processing and storage devices interconnected, resulting in high data traffic. While some sensors such as temperature, or humidity sensors produce a few bits of data periodically, imaging sensors output data in the range of megabytes every second. This raises a complexity for battery operated smart cameras, as they would be required to perform intensive image processing operations on large volumes of data, within energy consumption constraints. By using intelligence partitioning we analyse the effects of different partitioning scenarios for the processing tasks between the smart camera node, the fog computing layer and cloud computing, in the node energy consumption as well as the real time performance of the WVSN (Wireless Vision Sensor Node). The results obtained show that traditional design space exploration approaches are inefficient for WVSN, while intelligence partitioning enhances the energy consumption performance of the smart camera node and meets the timing constraints.", "Proper nutrition is essential for brain development during infancy, contributing to the continued development of cognitive, motor, and socio-emotional skills throughout life. Considering the insufficient published data in the Middle East and North Africa, experts drafted a questionnaire to assess the opinions and knowledge of physicians on the impact of nutrition on brain development and cognition in early life.\nThe questionnaire consisted of two parts: The first focused on the responders' demographic and professional characteristics and the second questioned the role of nutrition in brain development and cognition. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize respondents' characteristics and their responses to questions.\nA total of 1,500 questionnaires were distributed; 994 physicians responded. The majority of the surveyed physicians (64.4%) felt that nutrition impacts brain development in early childhood (0-4 years), with almost 90% of physicians agreeing/strongly agreeing that preventing iron, zinc, and iodine deficiency would improve global intelligence quotient. The majority of physicians (83%) agreed that head circumference was the most important measure of brain development. The majority of physicians (68.9%) responded that the period from the last trimester until 18 months postdelivery was crucial for brain growth and neurodevelopment, with 76.8% believing that infants breast-fed by vegan mothers have an increased risk of impaired brain development.\nThe results of this study show that practicing physicians significantly agree that nutrition plays an important role in brain and cognitive development and function in early childhood, particularly during the last trimester until 18 months postdelivery.", "Studies have revealed that there is an independent buffer for holding biological movements (BM) in working memory (WM), and this BM-WM has a unique link to our social ability. However, it remains unknown as to whether the BM-WM also correlates to our cognitive abilities, such as fluid intelligence (Gf). Since BM processing has been considered as a hallmark of social cognition, which distinguishes from canonical cognitive abilities in many ways, it has been hypothesized that only canonical object-WM (e.g., memorizing color patches), but not BM-WM, emerges to have an intimate relation with Gf. We tested this prediction by measuring the relationship between WM capacity of BM and Gf. With two Gf measurements, we consistently found moderate correlations between BM-WM capacity, the score of both Raven's advanced progressive matrix (RAPM), and the Cattell culture fair intelligence test (CCFIT). This result revealed, for the first time, a close relation between WM and Gf with a social stimulus, and challenged the double-dissociation hypothesis for distinct functions of different WM buffers.", "Shape-transformable liquid metal (LM) micromachines have attracted the attention of the scientific community over the past 5 years, but the inconvenience of transfer routes and the use of corrosive fuels have limited their potential applications. In this work, a shape-transformable LM micromotor that is fabricated by a simple, versatile ice-assisted transfer printing method is demonstrated, in which an ice layer is employed as a \"sacrificial\" substrate that can enable the direct transfer of LM micromotors to arbitrary target substrates conveniently. The resulting LM microswimmers display efficient propulsion of over 60 \u00b5m s-1 (\u22483 bodylength s-1 ) under elliptically polarized magnetic fields, comparable to that of the common magnetic micro/nanomotors with rigid bodies. Moreover, these LM micromotors can undergo dramatic morphological transformation in an aqueous environment under the irradiation of an alternating magnetic field. The ability to transform the shape and efficiently propel LM microswimmers holds great promise for chemical sensing, controlled cargo transport, materials science, and even artificial intelligence in ways that are not possible with rigid-bodies microrobots.", "Proper patient selection for immunotherapy is critical, as certain tumor microenvironments are more permissible to therapy than others. Currently, the use of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and microsatellite instability high and/or mismatch repair deficiency are used as biomarkers for immunotherapy response. To improve tumor characterization, methodologies are being developed to combine imaging with tumor immune environment characterization. Imaging of tumors from immunotherapy responders and nonresponders with various imaging modalities has led to the development of criteria that could predict patient response to immunotherapy. Additionally, radiomics-based artificial intelligence methods are being used to characterize tumor microenvironments to predict and evaluate immunotherapy responses, as well as to predict risk of immune-related adverse events. Molecular imaging techniques are also being developed for various modalities to observe tumor expression of immunotherapy targets, such as PD-L1 and, to confirm the target is being expressed on resident tumors. In all, the advancements of imaging techniques to define tumor immunologic characteristics will help to stratify patients who are more likely to respond to immunotherapies.

We examined the change in intellectual scores over time in patients with pediatric medulloblastoma treated with craniospinal PRT versus XRT.\nIntelligence test scores were obtained for a sample of pediatric patients treated between 2007 and 2018 on the same medulloblastoma protocols that differed only in radiotherapy modality (PRT v XRT). Growth curve analyses compared change in scores over time since diagnosis between groups.\nLongitudinal intelligence data from 79 patients (37 PRT, 42 XRT) were examined. Groups were similar on most demographic/clinical variables, including sex (67.1% male), age at diagnosis (mean, 8.6 years), craniospinal irradiation dose (median, 23.4 Gy), length of follow-up (mean, 4.3 years), and parental education (mean, 14.3 years). Boost dose (P < .001) and boost margin (P = .001) differed between groups. Adjusting for covariates, the PRT group exhibited superior long-term outcomes in global intelligence quotient (IQ), perceptual reasoning, and working memory compared with the XRT group (all P < .05). The XRT group exhibited a significant decline in global IQ, working memory, and processing speed (all P < .05). The PRT group exhibited stable scores over time in all domains with the exception of processing speed (P = .003).\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to compare intellectual trajectories between pediatric patients treated for medulloblastoma with PRT versus those treated with XRT on comparable, contemporary protocols. PRT was associated with more favorable intellectual outcomes in most domains compared with XRT, although processing speed emerged as a vulnerable domain for both groups. This study provides the strongest evidence to date of an intellectual sparing advantage with PRT in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma.", "One of the stated purposes of this Special Issue is to \"discuss when and why intelligence has disappeared\" in education. In this paper, I argue that intelligence is still heavily involved in public education in the United States due to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Moreover, due to several factors, including high-profile court cases, intelligence tests are legally used in an inconsistent manner in special education decision-making throughout the U.S. These cases illustrate the complex issues surrounding the psychometric properties of intelligence tests, historical conflicts surrounding racial equity, differences in federal versus state policies, and methodological concerns surrounding special education policies are discussed.", "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in patient care can offer significant benefits. However, there is a lack of independent evaluation considering AI in use. The paper argues that consideration should be given to how AI will be incorporated into clinical processes and services. Human factors challenges that are likely to arise at this level include cognitive aspects (automation bias and human performance), handover and communication between clinicians and AI systems, situation awareness and the impact on the interaction with patients. Human factors research should accompany the development of AI from the outset.", "This study presents an analysis of three models associated with artificial intelligence as tools to forecast the generation of urban solid waste in the city of Bogot\u00e1, in order to learn about this type of waste's behavior. The analysis was carried out in such a manner that different efficient alternatives are presented. In this paper, a possible decision-making strategy was explored and implemented to plan and design technologies for the stages of collection, transport and final disposal of waste in cities, while taking into account their particular characteristics. The first model used to analyze data was the decision tree which employed machine learning as a non-parametric algorithm that models data separation limitations based on the learning decision rules on the input characteristics of the model. Support vector machines were the second method implemented as a forecasting model. The primary advantage of support vector machines is their proper adjustment to data despite its variable nature or when faced with problems with a small amount of training data. Lastly, recurrent neural network models to forecast data were implemented, which yielded positive results. Their architectural design is useful in exploring temporal correlations among the same. Distribution by collection zone in the city, socio-economic stratification, population, and quantity of solid waste generated in a determined period of time were factors considered in the analysis of this forecast. The results found that support vector machines are the most appropriate model for this type of analysis.", "Given the importance of attention and executive functions (EF) in children's behavior, programs aimed at improving these processes are of special interest. Nexxo-training combines the use of the Nexxo touchscreen application (inhibition and vigilance tasks) with procedural metacognitive strategies (imparted by an instructor) for all the individuals using the app, regardless of their level of ability, plus compensatory strategies based on individual child performance. This study presents an analysis of the compensatory strategies that schoolchildren (aged 6-8 years old) receive when experiencing difficulties with EF tasks, in addition to an analysis of the developmental factors and cognitive skills that may modulate EF task performance.\nFor this study, we use data from a previous randomized active-controlled study (under review), in which forty-six typically developing children aged between 6 and 8 years old (24 girls/22 boys) were enrolled in the training group. The selected children were in the 1st grade (n = 28, x \u00af  = 78.32 \u00b1 4.037 months) and 3rd grade of primary education (n = 18, x \u00af  = 102.11 \u00b1 3.445). We collected data on EF training performance, compensatory strategies needed and neuropsychological assessments.\nA total of 80.43% participants required some form of compensatory strategy during training. Regarding required compensatory strategies, those who had lower scores in EF training needed more compensatory strategies, in particular, instructional comprehension (r = -0.561, p < 0.001 for inhibition-tasks; r = -0.342, p < 0.001 for vigilance-tasks). Concerning developmental factors, age significantly predicted better performance in both EF tasks (\u03b2 = 0.613, p < 0.001 for inhibition; \u03b2 = 0.706, p < 0.001 for attention). As regards task performance, those with better performance in inhibition tasks also had better performance in vigilance tasks (r = 0.72, p < 0.001). Finally, regarding cognitive skills, participants with higher performance in fluid intelligence (Q1, n = 12) had higher scores (U = 14.5, p < 0.05) than the group with the lowest performance (Q4, n = 11) in vigilance.\nAs previous literature suggests, inhibition is one of the core processes of EF. Therefore, we should focus training on the core EF processes. Inhibition and vigilance are closely related processes. In terms of the use of compensatory strategies, these are more needed for participants with lower levels of performance in inhibition or vigilance. Regarding strategy analysis, instructional comprehension and self-instruction (goal setting and planning) seem to be the most useful strategies for those with difficulties in inhibitory and vigilance task performance. Regarding development, as expected, age moderates task performance in inhibition and attention. Finally, cognitive skills, such as fluid intelligence and cognitive flexibility, predicted better results in attention. EF training using not only an app, but also compensatory strategies based on user performance, is a new research direction offering more opportunities to generalize EF training in everyday life.", "The negative association between cognitive intelligence (CI) and religiosity has been widely studied and is now well documented. In contrast, the role of emotional intelligence (EI) in this context has been poorly investigated thus far. Some available data indicate that EI, unlike CI, correlates positively with religiosity. To date, however, no study has explored the relationship between religiosity and both intelligences simultaneously. In current studies (Ns\u2009=\u2009301 and 200), we examined the interplay between all three constructs. The results showed that CI was positively correlated with ability EI and negatively with some measures of religiosity. EI, on the other hand, revealed no direct, significant relationship with religiosity. However, when combined into a single regression model with CI, EI became a significant positive predictor of religiosity. Moreover, Study 2 revealed that the link between EI and religiosity was mediated by empathy. Interestingly, we also found a reciprocal suppression between CI and EI, since both predictors increased their influence on religiosity when analyzed together. Although the suppression was present in both studies, it was observed for different religiosity measures in each case, indicating that this effect is probably dependent on various factors, such as sample structure or type of religiosity.", "As an artificial intelligence technique, case-based reasoning has considerable potential to build intelligent systems for smart agriculture, providing farmers with advice about farming operation management. A proper case representation method plays a crucial role in case-based reasoning systems. Some methods like textual, attribute-value pair, and ontological representations have been well explored by researchers. However, these methods may lead to inefficient case retrieval when a large volume of data is stored in the case base. Thus, an associated representation method is proposed in this paper for fast case retrieval. Each case is interconnected with several similar and dissimilar ones. Once a new case is reported, its features are compared with historical data by similarity measurements for identifying a relative similar past case. The similarity of associated cases is measured preferentially, instead of comparing all the cases in the case base. Experiments on case retrieval were performed between the associated case representation and traditional methods, following two criteria: the number of visited cases and retrieval accuracy. The result demonstrates that our proposal enables fast case retrieval with promising accuracy by visiting fewer past cases. In conclusion, the associated case representation method outperforms traditional methods in the aspect of retrieval efficiency.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have a long history, with increasing presence and potential in society and medicine. Much of the medical literature is highly optimistic about AI and machine learning, but fears also exist that healthcare professionals will be replaced by machines. AI remains mysterious for many practitioners, so this paper aims to unwind both hype and fear related to the technology for genetics professionals. After an historical introduction to AI in understandable and practical terms, we review its limitations. Building upon this foundation, we discuss current AI applications in medicine, including genomics and genetic counseling, offering grounded ideas about the impact and role of AI in genetic counseling and delivery of genetic services. Since AI is already being used in genomics today, now is the time to fundamentally understand what it is, how it is being used, what its limitations are, and how it will continue to be integrated into genetics as we look ahead.", "Intelligence gleaned from medical malpractice cases helps health care institutions analyze their litigation practices, trend financial outcomes, and even identify clinical services needing attention. But when examined more deeply, medical malpractice data can also be a powerful patient safety tool by revealing clinical patterns that contribute to medical errors and by enabling leadership to more accurately plan investments in patient safety and risk management. This case study describes how one organization, UMass Memorial Health Care in Worcester, Massachusetts, harnesses its deeply coded medical malpractice data and benchmarks its performance against national peers to catalyze clinical improvements. This strategy has proven successful in yielding positive change in such areas as emergency department ultrasound coverage, obstetrics communication, and airway management training. UMass Memorial's ability to embed claims data use into its culture and to share learning across clinical services offers lessons for health care organizations of any size.", "Purpose and aim: The overall aim of this study was to examine the relationship between adaptive function and cognitive factors in young adults diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in adult age.Methods: The study included 30 adults (age 18-30) diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. All participants were clinically referred to an adult psychiatric clinic for assessment. Adaptive functioning was measured with Adaptive Behavior Assessment System - 2nd edition (parent version). Wechsler scales of intelligence and Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System were used to measure intelligence and executive function.Results: We found considerable adaptive functioning deficits regardless of Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) level. FSIQ, working memory and processing speed were positively associated with adaptive functioning. No associations were found between adaptive functioning and cognitive flexibility, inhibition, word generation or shifting. Regression analysis showed that working memory and processing speed predicted 23% of the variance in adaptive functioning in this group.Conclusions: The results suggest that cognitive dysfunction could be an important area for intervention to improve adaptive functioning in ASD.", "The purpose of this paper is to develop an autonomous tracking algorithm based on adaptive fusion kinematics method, the autonomous laparoscope control algorithm and adaptive fusion kinematics method are proposed for semi-autonomous surgery, focus on solving the problems of autonomous laparoscope field of view control for surgical robot system. A novel autonomous tracking algorithm is proposed. To realize more robust tracking, an adaptive fusion kinematics method based on fuzzy logic is proposed, the method adaptive associates the kinematics information of surgical robot system and the laparoscope information. The proposed methods are implemented on the laparoscopic minimally invasive surgical robot system which is developed by our laboratory. Two experiments are carried out, the results indicate that the accurate autonomous field of view control is achieved with the addition of laparoscope information, laparoscopic motion frequency is reduced, the methods can avoid the laparoscope continuous motion and ensure the stability of field of view. The proposed methods improve the intelligence level of surgical robot system.", "Pneumothorax is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and often urgent intervention. In the ICU setting, large numbers of chest radiographs are performed and must be interpreted on a daily basis which may delay diagnosis of this entity. Development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to detect pneumothorax could help expedite detection as well as localize and potentially quantify pneumothorax. Open image analysis competitions are useful in advancing state-of-the art AI algorithms but generally require large expert annotated datasets. We have annotated and adjudicated a large dataset of chest radiographs to be made public with the goal of sparking innovation in this space. Because of the cumbersome and time-consuming nature of image labeling, we explored the value of using AI models to generate annotations for review. Utilization of this machine learning annotation (MLA) technique appeared to expedite our annotation process with relatively high sensitivity at the expense of specificity. Further research is required to confirm and better characterize the value of MLAs. Our adjudicated dataset is now available for public consumption in the form of a challenge.", "In this article, the authors review the animal and human data on the recent studies looking at the neurotoxicity of general anesthesia in the pediatric population. Animal studies in rodents and non-human primates demonstrate neurotoxic effects when exposed to general anesthesia at a young age. However, prospective clinical studies in humans do not show significant differences in intelligence quotient outcomes in children younger than 3 years with isolated and/or short exposures. Current studies are investigating alternatives to minimize the potential side effects, including the addition of protective agents to the anesthetic mix. Understanding the findings regarding the laboratory and clinical studies on the effects of general anesthesia is important in guiding both patient care and parent education. This is particularly relevant in the care of children with ophthalmic conditions such as trauma, congenital cataract, and congenital glaucoma, which may require urgent surgery and early anesthetic exposure.

AI applications raise numerous ethical questions, particularly about quality of care and patient-clinician relationships. This article accompanies 2 digital photo-paintings that address these ideas narratively and visually, with special emphasis on communication, compassion, and competence.", "Despite widespread use of the Internet and social media platforms by the public, there has been little organized exchange of information among the academic, government, and technology sectors about how digital communication technologies can be maximized to improve public health. The second Digital Health Promotion Executive Leadership Summit convened some of the world's leading thinkers from across these sectors to revisit how communication technology and the evolving social media platforms can be utilized to improve both individual and population health. The Summit focused on digital intelligence, the spread of misinformation, online patient communities, censorship in social media, and emerging global legal frameworks. In addition, Summit participants had an opportunity to review the original \"Common Agenda\" that emerged and was published after the inaugural Summit and recommend updates regarding the uses of digital technology for advancing the goals of public health. This article reports the outcomes of the Summit discussions and presents the updates that were recommended by Summit participants as the Digital Health Communication Common Agenda 2.0. Several of the assertions underlying the original Common Agenda have been modified, and several new assertions have been added to reflect the recommendations. In addition, a corresponding set of principles and related actions-including a recommendation that an interagency panel of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services be established to focus on digital health communication, with particular attention to social media-have been modified or supplemented.", "Girls and women with autism are often undiagnosed, misdiagnosed or receive a diagnosis of autism at later age. This can result in adverse outcomes in their well-being, mental health, education, employment, and independence. The diagnosis of autism spectrum condition/disorder (hereinafter referred to as autism), with its current features linked with descriptions in the major diagnostic classification systems, is based primarily on observations and research on males. The term 'Autism Spectrum Condition' (ASC), used in this paper, has been coined by Simon Baron-Cohen and used in the professional literature for a decade to respect these individuals on the autism spectrum who feel that the term 'disorder'is stigmatizing, whereas ASC presents both the strengths of these people and difficulties they experience. The research shows that autism in females has unique symptomatology and manifests itself differently, more subtly, especially in high-functioning girls and women, i.e., those with fluent speech, average or above-average intelligence quotient. The research also shows diagnostic stereotypes and lack of required sensitivity to identify autistic females. Additionally they do not reflect the unique presentation of autism in females demonstrated by greater compensatory capacity and an ability to develop sophisticated methods of 'camouflaging'and masquerading. Furthermore, autism in females is associated with high comorbidity during adolescence including anxiety disorder, tic disorder, depression, high incidence of suicide, eating disorders, and high rates of other medical problems. Timely diagnosis, however, can reduce the difficulties that females with autism experience over their lifetime, allowing for the assessment of their needs regarding health, education, leisure, social relationships, and employment.", "Tuberculosis is a leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide, and is an epidemic in many developing nations. Countries where the disease is common also tend to have poor access to medical care, including diagnostic tests. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence may help to bridge this gap. In this article, we review the applications of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of tuberculosis using chest radiography, covering simple computer-aided diagnosis systems to more advanced deep learning algorithms. In so doing, we will demonstrate an area where artificial intelligence could make a substantial contribution to global health through improved diagnosis in the future.", "This study aimed to evaluate the attention and inhibitory control functions in patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) and psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) and compare the results with the healthy control subjects. A total of 30 patients with GGE, 30 patients with PNES, and 32 healthy control subjects were included in the study. The severity of attention and inhibitory control deficit, general intelligence status, and psychopathology screening in all subjects were respectively investigated with the Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test (IVA-CPT), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), and the Symptoms Checklist 90-revised (SCL-90-R). Patients with PNES had severe impairments in all performed tasks compared with the control group and the group with GGE (p\u202f<\u202f0.01), whereas patients with GGE had significantly lower attention quotient versus healthy subjects (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). The full-scale attention quotient (FSAQ) and full-scale response control quotient (FSRCQ) in patients with PNES were significantly lower in comparison with GGE (47.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f32.68, 60.18\u202f\u00b1\u202f35.35, p\u202f<\u202f0.01), respectively. Multiple regression analysis did not demonstrate any significant effect of seizure frequency or epilepsy duration on attention and inhibitory control deficits, but patient's intelligence quotient (IQ) showed a significant effect on FSAQ and FSRCQ (\u03b2: 0.997, p\u202f<\u202f0.001; \u03b2: 0.933, p\u202f<\u202f0.001, respectively). Attention and inhibitory control are significantly impaired in patients with GGE and PNES. The cognitive deficits in patients with GGE and PNES have potentially important clinical implications in planning their neuropsychological rehabilitation.", "With the paradigm shift from hospital-centric healthcare to home-centric healthcare in Healthcare 4.0, healthcare robotics has become one of the fastest growing fields of robotics. The combination of robot capabilities with human intelligence, for example, telerobotics for home care, is gradually showing promising potentials. In this paper, the Home-TeleBot system, a generalized IoT-enabled telerobotic architecture designed to support home-centric healthcare system, is proposed. In particular, the implementation of it is realized by integrating human-motion-capture subsystem with robot-control subsystem. The dual-arm cooperative robot, YuMi, imitates human motion captured by a set of wearable inertial motion capture devices to complete tasks. The proposed approach using workspace mapping and path planning of robot manipulators, facilitates telerobot to execute tasks in a natural and human-like way. Based on the constant of proportionality calculated by comparing the human original workspace with the robot original workspace, the workspace mapping is achieved by making assumptions of the distance between end-effectors (human hands, robot's grippers) and shoulders. Additionally, robot manipulators' path is planned by setting virtual obstacles to constrain robot motion, which aims to improve the performance of robot's human-like motion. As a specific example of application, we apply the proposed architecture to a fetching task based on dual-arm motion capture and mapping for telerobotics in home care.", "In recent years, data-driven methods and artificial intelligence have been widely used in chemoinformatic and material informatics domains, for which the success is critically determined by the availability of training data with good quality and large quantity. A potential approach to break this bottleneck is by leveraging the chemical literature such as papers and patents as alternative data resources to high throughput experiments and simulation. Compared to other domains where natural language processing techniques have established successes, the chemical literature contains a large portion of phrases of multiple words that create additional challenges for accurate identification and representation. Here, we introduce a chemistry domain suitable approach to identify multiword chemical terms and train word representations at the phrase level. Through a series of special-designed experiments, we demonstrate that our multiword identifying and representing method effectively and accurately identifies multiword chemical terms from 119, 166 chemical patents and is more robust and precise to preserve the semantic meaning of chemical phrases compared to the conventional approach, which represents constituent single words first and combine them afterward. Because the accurate representation of chemical terms is the first and essential step to provide learning features for downstream natural language processing tasks, our results pave the road to utilize the large volume of chemical literature in future data-driven studies.", "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has complex genetic underpinnings, particularly in its early-onset form, which places siblings at a 10-fold increased risk of developing the disorder. Examination for neurocognitive markers preceding pediatric OCD onset has not been conducted, although markers have been identified in adult OCD. This study compared neurocognition across groups of OCD-affected youth (n\u00a0=\u00a087), unaffected siblings of those with early-onset OCD (n\u00a0=\u00a067), and healthy controls (HC; n\u00a0=\u00a079).\nA total of 233 participants aged 6-18\u00a0years old completed standardized neurocognitive tests of cognitive flexibility, decision making, planning, response inhibition, spatial working memory, attention, recognition nonverbal memory, and intelligence. They were administered the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Parent version (ADIS-P) and completed self-report anxiety and OCD questionnaires. Linear mixed-effects models tested for differences between groups, adjusting for age, gender, IQ, state anxiety, and ethnicity, and accounting for random effects of family membership.\nOCD-affected youth and unaffected siblings performed significantly worse on planning in comparison to HCs (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a00.74; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.11, 1.36]; Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a00.75; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[0.12, 1.38], respectively; omnibus group effect p\u00a0=\u00a0.007). No other significant between-group differences were identified.\nNeurocognitive performance differences between groups identified planning as a preexisting trait marker of pediatric OCD, while no other domain presented as a marker of pediatric OCD. This differs from adult OCD, which is associated with broader cognitive impairments. Investigating longitudinal trajectories and predictive significance of neurocognition in those affected by, and at risk for, early-onset OCD is warranted. Ideally, this will enhance individualized risk stratification and inform future prevention and early intervention strategies.", "Although both resting and task-induced functional connectivity (FC) have been used to characterize the human brain and cognitive abilities, the potential of task-induced FCs in individualized prediction for out-of-scanner cognitive traits remains largely unexplored. A recent study Greene et\u00a0al. (2018) predicted the fluid intelligence scores using FCs derived from rest and multiple task conditions, suggesting that task-induced brain state manipulation improved prediction of individual traits. Here, using a large dataset incorporating fMRI data from rest and 7 distinct task conditions, we replicated the original study by employing a different machine learning approach, and applying the method to predict two reading comprehension-related cognitive measures. Consistent with their findings, we found that task-based machine learning models often outperformed rest-based models. We also observed that combining multi-task fMRI improved prediction performance, yet, integrating the more fMRI conditions can not necessarily ensure better predictions. Compared with rest, the predictive FCs derived from language and working memory tasks were highlighted with more predictive power in predominantly default mode and frontoparietal networks. Moreover, prediction models demonstrated high stability to be generalizable across distinct cognitive states. Together, this replication study highlights the benefit of using task-based FCs to reveal brain-behavior relationships, which may confer more predictive power and promote the detection of individual differences of connectivity patterns underlying relevant cognitive traits, providing strong evidence for the validity and robustness of the original findings.", "This chapter focuses on several biological sequence analysis techniques used in computational biology and bioinformatics. The first section provides an overview of biological sequences (nucleic acids and proteins). Bioinformatics helps us understand complex biological problems by investigating similarities and differences that exist at sequence levels in poly-nucleic acids or proteins. Alignment algorithms such as dynamic programming, basic local alignment search tool and HHblits are discussed. Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods have been used successfully in analyzing sequence data and have played an important role in elucidating many biological functions, such as protein functional classification, active site recognition, protein structural features identification, and disease prediction outcomes. This chapter discusses both supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and hidden Markov models. Sequence analysis is incomplete without discussing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Deep sequencing is highly important due to its ability to address an increasingly diverse range of biological problems such as the ones encountered in therapeutics.

Academic motivation, procrastination, and major satisfaction were also studied. The sample consisted of 201 Lebanese undergraduates. The model represented a good fit. There was a negative direct effect of procrastination on AP and positive direct effects of major satisfaction and absorption on AP. Trait EI showed a negative direct effect on procrastination and a positive direct effect on major satisfaction, which, in turn, significantly predicted AP. Also, conscientiousness indirectly predicted AP, via procrastination, major satisfaction, and absorption. Findings point at individual differences contributing to AP and can be helpful to students, educators, and counselors in higher education.", "This paper presents a novel approach to fast and accurate non-linear pulse signal reconstruction dedicated for electromagnetic sensors and their applications such as ELectronic INTelligence (ELINT), electronic warfare (EW), electronic reconnaissance (ER) systems, as well as for passive bistatic radar purposes in which other pulse radars are used as a source of illumination. The method is based on the instantaneous chirp rate (CR) estimation in the time-frequency (TF) domain providing a calculation of the frequency rate between every two consecutive samples. Such a new method allows for the precise reconstruction of the non-linear frequency modulated (NLFM) signal to be carried out in significantly shorter time in comparison to methods known in the literature. The presented approach was tested and validated using both simulated and real-life radar signals proving the usability of the proposed solution in practical applications. The results were compared with the precise extended generalized chirp transform (EGCT) method as a reference technique, using optimal matched filtration as the main concept.", "Olfactory dysfunction is a known clinical feature of multiple sclerosis (MS). Some studies have shown that odor identification impairment is an essential feature associated with cognitive function in MS. This study investigates the relationship between olfactory identification and the disease state, including cognitive function and central brain volume, to evaluate the utility of olfactory identification in the clinical assessment of relapsing-remitting (RR) MS.\nForty patients with RRMS and 40 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Their olfactory identification was measured using the Odor Stick Identification Test for the Japanese (OSIT-J). Cognitive function was evaluated by the Japanese version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition (WAIS-III), and depressive mood was evaluated by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the third ventricle width (3rd VW) as a marker of central brain atrophy.\nRRMS patients had a significantly lower OSIT-J score than HCs. The OSIT-J score was significantly lower in RRMS patients with low processing speed (PS) and working memory (WM) scores than RRMS patients with normal PS or WM scores. The OSIT-J score was significantly related to the PS, WM, and the 3rd VW. The OSIT-J score also showed a mild correlation with the expanded disability status scale and disease duration, but not with the number of clinical attacks or patient's age.\nOur results suggest that olfactory identification impairment occurs in association with cognitive dysfunction and central brain atrophy. Thus, olfactory identification is a possible disease marker of RRMS as with cognitive impairment, especially PS, reflecting the diffuse neurodegeneration in RRMS.", "Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer deaths in the world, but its mortality can be significantly reduced by diagnosis and early detection. Computerized resources were developed to assist radiologists in their management of the large volume of thoracic images to be analyzed. Their objective is the detection of pulmonary nodules with high sensitivity and a low rate of false-positives and the ability to differentiate benign and malignant nodules. The volume of a pulmonary nodule and its volume doubling time are essential to nodule management. Computer aided detection or diagnosis (CAD) software are not currently used in clinically settings on a routine basis . Significant advances are expected due to the implementation of the artificial intelligence systems who will probably be integrated into the multidisciplinary management of any pulmonary nodule.\nLe cancer du poumon reste la principale cause de d\u00e9c\u00e8s par cancer dans le monde.

However,\u00a0an underlying assumption particularly regarding utilization of simulation by those who are in practice, is that simulation will be selected as a continuing professional development (CPD) strategy. Exploring\u00a0reasons for choices of educational formats, particularly regarding simulation, is\u00a0poorly integrated into CPD research.\nDespite significant advances the scientific simulation community has been slow to produce evidence regarding why practitioners may be reserved in engaging in simulation or not. Using examples from related education contexts the author attempts to bridge simulation science, CPD and less commonly used theoretical frameworks to address this issue. The author argues that theoretical perspectives that recognize the use of\u00a0simulation for CPD as a socio-personal process and/or a personal or group issue (e.g., theories of intelligence, self-determination theory, theory of planned behavior, social identity theory) and that are conceptually distinct from educational mechanisms/ provision are necessary to advance simulation use\u00a0in CPD contexts.\nGiven the close relationship practicing clinicians have to patient outcomes a new imperative may be to focus on the theoretical and practical links informing simulation use for CPD at the level of the individual and individual-among-professional groups. The simulation community may therefore need to engage in research that attempts to further uncover and address underlying issues of \"why\" clinicians\u00a0integrate simulation as CPD activities or not.", "Introduction: Detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules is an important issue, because the process is the first step in the management of lung cancers.Areas covered: Literature review was performed on May 15 2019 by using the PubMed, US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, and the National Center for Biotechnology information. CT features helping identify the druggable mutations and predict the prognosis of malignant nodules were presented. Technical advancements in MRI and PET/CT were introduced for providing functional information about malignant nodules. Advances in various tissue biopsy techniques enabling molecular analysis and histologic diagnosis of indeterminate nodules were also presented. New techniques such as radiomics, deep learning (DL) technology, and artificial intelligence showing promise in differentiating between malignant and benign nodules were summarized. Recently, updated management guidelines for solid and subsolid nodules incidentally detected on CT were described. Risk stratification and prediction models for indeterminate nodules under active investigation were briefly summarized.Expert opinion: Advancement in CT knowledge has led to a better correlation between CT features and genomic alterations or tumor histology. Recent advances like PET/CT, MRI, radiomics, and DL-based approach have shown promising results in the characterization and prognostication of pulmonary nodules.", "Nonadherence among patients with chronic disease continues to be a significant concern, and the use of text message refill reminders has been effective in improving adherence. However, questions remain about how differences in patient characteristics and demographics might influence the likelihood of refill using this channel.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an SMS-based refill reminder solution using conversational artificial intelligence (AI; an automated system that mimics human conversations) with a large Medicare patient population and to explore the association and impact of patient demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, language) and social determinants of health on successful engagement with the solution to improve refill adherence.\nThe study targeted 99,217 patients with chronic disease, median age of 71 years, for medication refill using the mPulse Mobile interactive SMS text messaging solution from December 2016 to February 2019. All patients were partially adherent or nonadherent Medicare Part D members of Kaiser Permanente, Southern California, a large integrated health plan. Patients received SMS reminders in English or Spanish and used simple numeric or text responses to validate their identity, view their medication, and complete a refill request. The refill requests were processed by Kaiser Permanente pharmacists and support staff, and refills were picked up at the pharmacy or mailed to patients. Descriptive statistics and predictive analytics were used to examine the patient population and their refill behavior. Qualitative text analysis was used to evaluate quality of conversational AI.\nOver the course of the study, 273,356 refill reminders requests were sent to 99,217 patients, resulting in 47,552 refill requests (17.40%). This was consistent with earlier pilot study findings. Of those who requested a refill, 54.81% (26,062/47,552) did so within 2 hours of the reminder. There was a strong inverse relationship (r10=-0.93) between social determinants of health and refill requests. Spanish speakers (5149/48,156, 10.69%) had significantly lower refill request rates compared with English speakers (42,389/225,060, 18.83%; X21 [n=273,216]=1829.2; P<.001). There were also significantly different rates of refill requests by age band (X26 [n=268,793]=1460.3; P<.001), with younger patients requesting refills at a higher rate. Finally, the vast majority (284,598/307,484, 92.23%) of patient responses were handled using conversational AI.\nMultiple factors impacted refill request rates, including a strong association between social determinants of health and refill rates. The findings suggest that higher refill requests are linked to language, race/ethnicity, age, and social determinants of health, and that English speakers, whites, those younger than 75 years, and those with lower social determinants of health barriers are significantly more likely to request a refill via SMS. A neural network-based predictive model with an accuracy level of 78% was used to identify patients who might benefit from additional outreach to narrow identified gaps based on demographic and socioeconomic factors.", "Stunting affects more than 161 million children worldwide and can compromise cognitive development beginning early in childhood. There is a paucity of research using neuroimaging tools in conjunction with sensitive behavioral assays in low-income settings, which has hindered researchers' ability to explain how stunting impacts brain and behavioral development. We employed high-density EEG to examine associations among children's physical growth, brain functional connectivity (FC), and cognitive development.\nWe recruited participants from an urban impoverished neighborhood in Dhaka, Bangladesh. One infant cohort consisted of 92 infants whose height (length) was measured at 3, 4.5, and 6\u2009months; EEG data were collected at 6\u2009months; and cognitive outcomes were assessed using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning at 27\u2009months. A second, older cohort consisted of 118 children whose height was measured at 24, 30, and 36\u2009months; EEG data were collected at 36\u2009months; and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores were assessed at 48\u2009months. Height-for-age (HAZ) z-scores were calculated based on the World Health Organization standard. EEG FC in different frequency bands was calculated in the cortical source space. Linear regression and longitudinal path analysis were conducted to test the associations between variables, as well as the indirect effect of child growth on cognitive outcomes via brain FC.\nIn the older cohort, we found that HAZ was negatively related to brain FC in the theta and beta frequency bands, which in turn was negatively related to children's IQ score at 48\u2009months. Longitudinal path analysis showed an indirect effect of HAZ on children's IQ via brain FC in both the theta and beta bands. There were no associations between HAZ and brain FC or cognitive outcomes in the infant cohort.\nThe association observed between child growth and brain FC may reflect a broad deleterious effect of malnutrition on children's brain development. The mediation effect of FC on the relation between child growth and later IQ provides the first evidence suggesting that brain FC may serve as a neural pathway by which biological adversity impacts cognitive development.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and management in patients with lung disease through automated detection, quantification, classification, and prediction of disease progression.\nOwing to unspecific symptoms, few well-defined CT disease patterns, and varying prognosis, interstitial lungs disease represents a\u00a0focus of AI-based research.\nSupervised and unsupervised machine learning can identify CT disease patterns using features which may allow the analysis of associations with specific diseases and outcomes.\nMachine learning on the one hand improves computer-aided detection of pulmonary nodules. On the other hand it enables further characterization of pulmonary nodules, which may improve resource effectiveness regarding lung cancer screening programs.\nThere are several challenges regarding AI-based CT data analysis. Besides the need for powerful algorithms, expert annotations and extensive training data sets that reflect physiologic and pathologic variability are required for effective machine learning. Comparability and reproducibility of AI research deserve consideration due to a\u00a0lack of standardization in this emerging field.\nThis review article presents the state of the art and the challenges concerning AI in lung imaging with special consideration of interstitial lung disease, and detection and consideration of pulmonary nodules.", "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and lower cognitive ability have been linked with increased likelihood of exposure to adversity. We hypothesized that these associations may be partly due to genetic factors.\nWe calculated polygenic scores for ADHD and intelligence and assessed psychopathology and general cognitive ability in a sample of 297 youth aged 5-27\u00a0years enriched for offspring of parents with mood and psychotic disorders. We calculated an adversity score as a mean of 10 indicators, including socio-economic disadvantage, childhood maltreatment and bullying. We tested the effects of polygenic scores, externalizing symptoms and IQ on adversity scores using mixed-effects\u00a0linear regression.\nExternalizing symptoms and general cognitive ability showed expected positive and negative relationships with adversity, respectively. Polygenic scores for intelligence were unrelated to adversity, but polygenic scores for ADHD were associated with adversity (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.23, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.34, p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). ADHD polygenic scores uniquely explained 4.0% of variance in adversity score. The relationship between polygenic scores for ADHD and adversity was independently significant among individuals with (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.75, p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and without (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.26, p\u00a0=\u00a0.022) ADHD.\nA genetic score indexing liability to ADHD was associated with exposure to adversity in early life. Previously observed associations between externalizing symptoms, lower cognitive ability and adversity may be partially attributed to genetic liability to ADHD.", "Historically, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not considered an effective modality in the evaluation of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Over the past decade this has changed, with studies demonstrating that MRI is the most sensitive imaging tool for detection of all grades of DCIS. It has been suggested that not only is breast MRI the most sensitive imaging tool for detection but it may also detect the most clinically relevant DCIS lesions. The role and outcomes of MRI in the preoperative setting for patients with DCIS remains controversial; however, several studies have shown benefit in the preoperative evaluation of extent of disease as well as predicting an underlying invasive component. The most common presentation of DCIS on MRI is nonmass enhancement (NME) in a linear or segmental distribution pattern. Maximizing breast MRI spatial resolution is therefore beneficial, given the frequent presentation of DCIS as NME on MRI. Emerging MRI techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), have shown promising potential to discriminate DCIS from benign and invasive lesions. Future opportunities including advanced imaging visual techniques, radiomics/radiogenomics, and machine learning / artificial intelligence may also be applicable to the detection and treatment of DCIS.

Current embryo assessment approaches such as manual microscopy analysis done by embryologists or semi-automated time-lapse imaging systems are highly subjective, time-consuming, or expensive. Availability of cost-effective and easy-to-use hardware and software for embryo image data acquisition and analysis can significantly empower embryologists towards more efficient clinical decisions both in resource-limited and resource-rich settings. Here, we report the development of two inexpensive (<$100 and <$5) and automated imaging platforms that utilize advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for rapid, reliable, and accurate evaluations of embryo morphological qualities. Using a layered learning approach, we have shown that network models pre-trained with high quality embryo image data can be re-trained using data recorded on such low-cost, portable optical systems for embryo assessment and classification when relatively low-resolution image data are used. Using two test sets of 272 and 319 embryo images recorded on the reported stand-alone and smartphone optical systems, we were able to classify embryos based on their cell morphology with >90% accuracy.", "The emergence of the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) paradigm and the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and services unveiled new potentials for the domain of domestic living, where the line between \"the computer\" and the (intelligent) environment becomes altogether invisible. Particularly, the residents of a house can use the living room not only as a traditional social and individual space where many activities take place, but also as a smart ecosystem that (a) enhances leisure activities by providing a rich suite of entertainment applications, (b) implements a home control middleware, (c) acts as an intervention host that is able to display appropriate content when the users need help or support, (d) behaves as an intelligent agent that communicates with the users in a natural manner and assists them throughout their daily activities, (e) presents a notification hub that provides personalized alerts according to contextual information, and (f) becomes an intermediary communication center for the family. This paper (i) describes how the \"Intelligent Living Room\" realizes these newly emerged roles, (ii) presents the process that was followed in order to design the living room environment, (iii) introduces the hardware and software facilities that were developed in order to improve quality of life, and (iv) reports the findings of various evaluation experiments conducted to assess the overall User Experience (UX).", "Human-in-the-loop (HITL) AI may enable an ideal symbiosis of human experts and AI models, harnessing the advantages of both while at the same time overcoming their respective limitations. The purpose of this study was to investigate a novel collective intelligence technology designed to amplify the diagnostic accuracy of networked human groups by forming real-time systems modeled on biological swarms. Using small groups of radiologists, the swarm-based technology was applied to the diagnosis of pneumonia on chest radiographs and compared against human experts alone, as well as two state-of-the-art deep learning AI models. Our work demonstrates that both the swarm-based technology and deep-learning technology achieved superior diagnostic accuracy than the human experts alone. Our work further demonstrates that when used in combination, the swarm-based technology and deep-learning technology outperformed either method alone. The superior diagnostic accuracy of the combined HITL AI solution compared to radiologists and AI alone has broad implications for the surging clinical AI deployment and implementation strategies in future practice.", "Local treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) has been pointed out to be a novel therapeutic approach with several advantages when compared to conventional therapies. However, the development of systems able to fulfil the requirements of this administration route is not an easy task. The present work suggests the utilization of Artificial Intelligence Tools (AIT) as an instrument to understand polymer-polymer interactions towards obtaining thermosensitive hydrogels suitable for protein rectal administration in IBD. Enemas composed by Pluronic\u00ae F127 and F68 and Methocel\u00ae K4M were developed and characterised. Two experimental designs were carried out in order to determine the effect of each polymer on their texturometric and rheological behaviour. Using the results of the first experimental design we can justify the inclusion of each raw material PF127, PF68 and MK4M in the formulation and conclude that a compromise solution is necessary to obtain thermosensitive hydrogels of the required properties. The results of the second experimental design allowed concluding that PF127 ruled mainly syringeability and bioadhesion work. On the other hand, PF68 modulated principally gelation temperature, viscosity and protein release from hydrogel matrix. Finally, MK4M influenced bioadhesiveness and mostly determined viscosity. AIT also allowed delimiting the design space to produce easy administrable and highly bioadhesive enemas that undergo fast sol-gel transitions at body temperature.", "Cerebellar atrophy (especially involving the superior-anterior cerebellar vermis) is among the most salient and clinically significant effects of chronic hazardous alcohol consumption on brain structure. Smaller cerebellar volumes are also associated with chronic cigarette smoking. The present study investigated effects of both chronic alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking on cerebellar structure and its relation to performance on select cognitive/behavioral tasks.\nUsing T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs), the Cerebellar Analysis Tool Kit segmented the cerebellum into bilateral hemispheres and 3 vermis parcels from 4 participant groups: smoking (s) and nonsmoking (ns) abstinent alcohol-dependent treatment seekers (ALC) and controls (CON) (i.e., sALC, nsALC, sCON, and nsCON). Cognitive and behavioral data were also obtained.\nWe found detrimental effects of chronic drinking on all cerebellar structural measures in ALC participants, with largest reductions seen in vermis areas. Furthermore, both smoking groups had smaller volumes of cerebellar hemispheres but not vermis areas compared to their nonsmoking counterparts. In exploratory analyses, smaller cerebellar volumes were related to lower measures of intelligence. In sCON, but not sALC, greater smoking severity was related to smaller cerebellar volume and smaller superior-anterior vermis area. In sALC, greater abstinence duration was associated with larger cerebellar and superior-anterior vermis areas, suggesting some recovery with abstinence.\nOur results show that both smoking and alcohol status are associated with smaller cerebellar structural measurements, with vermal areas more vulnerable to chronic alcohol consumption and less affected by chronic smoking. These morphometric cerebellar deficits were also associated with lower intelligence and related to duration of abstinence in sALC only.", "Infant consumption of formula reconstituted with fluoridated water can lead to excessive fluoride intake. We examined the association between fluoride exposure in infancy and intellectual ability in children who lived in fluoridated or non-fluoridated cities in Canada.\nWe examined 398 mother-child dyads in the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals cohort who reported drinking tap water. We estimated water fluoride concentration using municipal water reports. We used linear regression to analyze the association between fluoride exposure and IQ scores, measured by the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence-III at 3-4\u202fyears. We examined whether feeding status (breast-fed versus formula-fed) modified the impact of water fluoride and if fluoride exposure during fetal development attenuated this effect. A second model estimated the association between fluoride intake from formula and child IQ.\nThirty-eight percent of mother-child dyads lived in fluoridated communities. An increase of 0.5\u202fmg/L in water fluoride concentration (approximately equaling the difference between fluoridated and non-fluoridated regions) corresponded to a 9.3- and 6.2-point decrement in Performance IQ among formula-fed (95% CI: -13.77, -4.76) and breast-fed children (95% CI: -10.45, -1.94). The association between water fluoride concentration and Performance IQ remained significant after controlling for fetal fluoride exposure among formula-fed (B\u202f=\u202f-7.93, 95% CI: -12.84, -3.01) and breastfed children (B\u202f=\u202f-6.30, 95% CI: -10.92, -1.68). A 0.5\u202fmg increase in fluoride intake from infant formula corresponded to an 8.8-point decrement in Performance IQ (95% CI: -14.18, -3.34) and this association remained significant after controlling for fetal fluoride exposure (B\u202f=\u202f-7.62, 95% CI: -13.64, -1.60).\nExposure to increasing levels of fluoride in tap water was associated with diminished non-verbal intellectual abilities; the effect was more pronounced among formula-fed children.", "The prevalence and impact of motor coordination difficulties in children with copy number variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (ND-CNVs) remains unknown. This study aims to advance understanding of motor coordination difficulties in children with ND-CNVs and establish relationships between intelligence quotient (IQ) and psychopathology.\n169 children with an ND-CNV (67% male, median age = 8.88 years, range 6.02-14.81) and 72 closest-in-age unaffected siblings (controls; 55% male, median age = 10.41 years, s.d. = 3.04, range 5.89-14.75) were assessed with the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, alongside psychiatric interviews and standardised assessments of IQ.\nThe children with ND-CNVs had poorer coordination ability (b = 28.98, p < 0.001) and 91% of children with an ND-CNV screened positive for suspected developmental coordination disorder, compared to 19% of controls (OR = 42.53, p < 0.001). There was no difference in coordination ability between ND-CNV genotypes (F = 1.47, p = 0.184). Poorer coordination in children with ND-CNV was associated with more attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (\u03b2 = -0.18, p = 0.021) and autism spectrum disorder trait (\u03b2 = -0.46, p < 0.001) symptoms, along with lower full-scale (\u00df = 0.21, p = 0.011), performance (\u03b2 = -0.20, p = 0.015) and verbal IQ (\u03b2 = 0.17, p = 0.036). Mediation analysis indicated that coordination ability was a full mediator of anxiety symptoms (69% mediated, p = 0.012), and a partial mediator of ADHD (51%, p = 0.001) and autism spectrum disorder trait symptoms (66%, p < 0.001) as well as full scale IQ (40%, p = 0.002), performance IQ (40%, p = 0.005) and verbal IQ (38%, p = 0.006) scores.\nThe findings indicate that poor motor coordination is highly prevalent and closely linked to risk of mental health disorder and lower intellectual function in children with ND-CNVs. Future research should explore whether early interventions for poor coordination ability could ameliorate neurodevelopmental risk.", "Using augmented intelligence clinical decision tools and a risk score-guided multidisciplinary team-based care process (MTCP), this study evaluated the MTCP for heart failure (HF) patients' 30-day readmission and 30-day mortality across 20 Intermountain Healthcare hospitals.\nHF inpatient care and 30-day post-discharge management require quality improvement to impact patient health, optimize utilization, and avoid readmissions.\nHF inpatients (N\u202f=\u202f6182) were studied from January 2013 to November 2016. In February 2014, patients began receiving care via the MTCP based on a phased implementation in which the 8 largest Intermountain hospitals (accounting for 89.8% of HF inpatients) were crossed over sequentially in a stepped manner from control to MTCP over 2.5 years. After implementation, patient risk scores were calculated within 24 hours of admission and delivered electronically to clinicians. High-risk patients received MTCP care (n\u202f=\u202f1221), while lower-risk patients received standard HF care (n\u202f=\u202f1220). Controls had their readmission and mortality scores calculated retrospectively (high risk: n\u202f=\u202f1791; lower risk: n\u202f=\u202f1950).\nHigh-risk MTCP recipients had 21% lower 30-day readmission compared to high-risk controls (adjusted P\u202f=\u202f.013, HR\u202f=\u202f0.79, CI\u202f=\u202f0.66, 0.95) and 52% lower 30-day mortality (adjusted P\u202f<\u202f.001, HR\u202f=\u202f0.48, CI\u202f=\u202f0.33, 0.69). Lower-risk patients did not experience increased readmission (adjusted HR\u202f=\u202f0.88, P\u202f=\u202f.19) or mortality (adjusted HR\u202f=\u202f0.88, P\u202f=\u202f.61). Some utilization was higher, such as prescription of home health, for MTCP recipients, with no changes in length of stay or overall costs.\nA risk score-guided MTCP was associated with lower 30-day readmission and 30-day mortality in high-risk HF inpatients. Further evaluation of this clinical management approach is required.", "The present study evaluates differences in self-reported intrinsic and extrinsic academic motivation and amotivation between eighth-grade adolescents with (n\u2009=\u2009162) and without (n\u2009=\u2009140) ADHD. This study also examines associations between motivation and academic functioning with objective (i.e., grade point average, standardized reading and math scores) and cross-rater measurement (i.e., parent-reported homework performance). Multivariate analysis of variance controlling for sex, intelligence, and medication status found that adolescents with ADHD exhibited a significant motivational deficit compared to adolescents without ADHD across all areas of academic motivation, including intrinsic motivation (d\u2009=\u20090.49), extrinsic motivation (d\u2009=\u20090.43), and amotivation (d\u2009=\u20090.42). To examine whether motivation was differentially associated with academic impairment in the ADHD and comparison groups, a multi-group path analysis was conducted controlling for sex, intelligence, and medication status. Findings showed that motivation was differentially associated with academic impairment for adolescents with and without ADHD. For the comparison group, higher amotivation was associated with poorer homework performance and lower intrinsic motivation was associated with lower reading accuracy. In the ADHD group, higher amotivation was associated with poorer homework performance and math fluency, higher extrinsic motivation was associated with better homework performance and higher GPA, and higher intrinsic motivation was associated with higher reading accuracy. This study builds upon previous research in demonstrating that adolescents with ADHD have academic motivational deficits when compared to their peers without ADHD. Research is needed to understand the longitudinal interplay of academic motivation and academic functioning, with an eye towards developing or modifying interventions to increase academic motivation and academic success.", "Protein associations are at the core of biological activity, and the drug-based disruption of dysfunctional associations poses a major challenge to targeted therapy. The problem becomes daunting when the structure and regulated modulation of the complex are unknown. To address the challenge, we leverage an artificial intelligence platform that learns from structural and epistructural data and infers regulation-susceptible regions that also generate interfacial tension between protein and water, thereby promoting protein associations. The input consists of sequence-derived 1D-features. The network is configured with evolutionarily coupled residues and taught to search for phosphorylation-modulated binding epitopes. The discovery platform is benchmarked against a PDB-derived testing set and validated against experimental data on a therapeutic disruptor designed according to the inferred epitope for a large deregulated complex known to be recruited in heart failure. Thus, dysfunctional \"molecular brakes\" of cardiac contractility get released through a therapeutic intervention guided by artificial intelligence.", "This study presents a framework for the leadership of integrated, interprofessional health, and social-care teams (IgTs) based on a previous literature review and a qualitative study. The theoretical framework for Integrated Team Leadership (IgTL) is based on contributions from 15 professional and nonprofessional staff, in 8 community teams in the United Kingdom. Participants shared their perceptions of IgT's good practice in relation to patient outcomes. There were two clear elements, Person-focused and Task-focused leadership behaviors with particular emphasis on the facilitation of shared professional practices. Person-focused leadership skills include: inspiring and motivating; walking the talk; change and innovation; consideration; empowerment, teambuilding and team maintenance; and emotional intelligence. Task-focused leadership behaviors included: setting team direction; managing performance; and managing external relationships. Team members felt that the IgTL should be: a Health or Social Care (HSC) professional; engaged in professional practice; and have worked in an IgT before leading one. Technical and cultural issues were identified that differentiate IgTL from usual leadership practice; in particular the ability to facilitate or create barriers to effective integrated teamworking within the organizational context. In common with other OECD countries, there are policy imperatives in England for further integration of health and social care, needed to improve the quality and effectiveness of care for older people with multiple conditions. Further attention is needed to support the development of effective IgTs and leadership will be a pre-requisite to achieve this vision. The research advances the understanding of the need for skilled interprofessional leadership practice.", "Amongst the main objectives of physical education (PE) classes is the consolidation of healthy lifestyle habits in young people and adolescents. Nonetheless, these classes can also provide the basis from which adverse experiences are generated which affect students' perceptions of these classes. Previously conducted studies have focused on motivational processes and not on emotional processes, nor on the way in which students learn. The objective of the present study was to explore the dark side of the self-determination theory, its influence on emotional intelligence and the meta-cognitive strategies of students.\nA total of 1602 young people undertaking secondary education participated, with self-reported ages between 13 and 19 years. The following questionnaires were utilized: Controlling Coach Behaviors Scale,Frustration of Psychological Needs inPEclasses Scale, Emotional Intelligence inPEScale andMotivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. A structural equation model was developed which explained causal associations between the study variables.\nPsychological control positively predicted each one of the sub-factors of frustration of psychological needs. Frustration of psychological needs negatively predicted emotional intelligence. Finally, emotional intelligence positively predicted meta-cognitive thinking.\nThe influence and importance of the teaching style adopted by teachers is indicated, in addition to the effect of students' psychological experiences on emotions and learning strategies.", "In recent years, the development of high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies and their establishment in an industrialized environment have given scientists the possibility to test millions of molecules and profile them against a multitude of biological targets in a short period of time, generating data in a much faster pace and with a higher quality than before. Besides the structure activity data from traditional bioassays, more complex assays such as transcriptomics profiling or imaging have also been established as routine profiling experiments thanks to the advancement of Next Generation Sequencing or automated microscopy technologies. In industrial pharmaceutical research, these technologies are typically established in conjunction with automated platforms in order to enable efficient handling of screening collections of thousands to millions of compounds. To exploit the ever-growing amount of data that are generated by these approaches, computational techniques are constantly evolving. In this regard, artificial intelligence technologies such as deep learning and machine learning methods play a key role in cheminformatics and bio-image analytics fields to address activity prediction, scaffold hopping, de novo molecule design, reaction/retrosynthesis predictions, or high content screening analysis. Herein we summarize the current state of analyzing large-scale compound data in industrial pharmaceutical research and describe the impact it has had on the drug discovery process over the last two decades, with a specific focus on deep-learning technologies.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-facilitated clinical automation is expected to become increasingly prevalent in the near future. AI techniques may permit rapid and detailed analysis of the large quantities of clinical data generated in modern healthcare settings, at a level that is otherwise impossible by humans. Subsequently, AI may enhance clinical practice by pushing the limits of diagnostics, clinical decision making, and prognostication. Moreover, if combined with surgical robotics and other surgical adjuncts such as image guidance, AI may find its way into the operating room and permit more accurate interventions, with fewer errors. Despite the considerable hype surrounding the impending medical AI revolution, little has been written about potential downsides to increasing clinical automation. These may include both direct and indirect consequences. Directly, faulty, inadequately trained, or poorly understood algorithms may produce erroneous results, which may have wide-scale impact. Indirectly, increasing use of automation may exacerbate de-skilling of human physicians due to over-reliance, poor understanding, overconfidence, and lack of necessary vigilance of an automated clinical workflow. Many of these negative phenomena have already been witnessed in other industries that have already undergone, or are undergoing \"automation revolutions,\" namely commercial aviation and the automotive industry. This narrative review explores the potential benefits and consequences of the anticipated medical AI revolution from a neurosurgical perspective.", "We are teetering on the precipice of the imminent Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this new age, systems are set to become more densely intraconnected and interconnected, and massive sociotechnical systems exhibiting unprecedented levels of complexity will increasingly take hold. At the dawning of this new age, the Ergonomics discipline must reflect on its preparedness for tackling problems in these novel systems. This paper engages in this reflection by putting forth a critical commentary on the implication of these changes on the discipline and discusses the utility of our current methods in this new paradigm. A resulting Radical Systems Thinking in Ergonomics Manifesto is put forward - a set of mandates to guide practitioners and researchers in the development of new methods capable of coping with these imminent challenges. From the manifesto are derived a series of capability requirements for future computational modelling approaches in Ergonomics. Practitioner summary: The goal of this paper was to inspire the Ergonomics community to pursue further applications involving computational modelling approaches such as Agent-Based Modelling. It presents a manifesto for the future of the discipline, and from this the capabilities that future computational modelling approaches need to possess.

The ScribeMD intra-class pen pal program is a narrative medicine tool designed to meet this need with a focus on the journey through medical education. This study intends to evaluate the efficacy of this novel program on the participants' professional identity formation (PIF), emotional intelligence development (EID), and narrative competency improvement (NCI).Methods: This program evaluation involved quantitative and qualitative survey solicitations from first and second-year medical student participants and controls. An efficacy-triangulation model was developed as a quantitative outcome-measuring tool linking objective, writing prompts, and survey data.Results: The quantitative results showed statistically significant improvements in line with the Efficacy Triangulation Model in the participant group. Qualitatively, reflective and insight-driven gains were elicited, as were notable themes of personal and community improvements.Conclusion: ScribeMD poses a unique avenue for the development of more humanistic physicians during their medical education. We recommend additional development of the Efficacy Triangulation Model as well as the program design itself. We also recommend the piloting of this program in other healthcare-education settings both with medical education and other health professions.", "Fabrication of human-like intelligent tactile sensors is an intriguing challenge for developing human-machine interfaces. As inspired by somatosensory signal generation and neuroplasticity-based signal processing, intelligent neuromorphic tactile sensors with learning and memory based on the principle of a triboelectric nanogenerator are demonstrated. The tactile sensors can actively produce signals with various amplitudes on the basis of the history of pressure stimulations because of their capacity to mimic neuromorphic functions of synaptic potentiation and memory. The time over which these tactile sensors can retain the memorized information is alterable, enabling cascaded devices to have a multilevel forgetting process and to memorize a rich amount of information. Furthermore, smart fingers by using the tactile sensors are constructed to record a rich amount of information related to the fingers' current actions and previous actions. This intelligent active tactile sensor can be used as a functional element for artificial intelligence.", "Physicians have been performing the art of medicine for hundreds of years, and since the ancient era, patients have turned to physicians for help, advice, and cures. When the fathers of medicine started writing down their experience, knowledge, and observations, treating medical conditions became a structured process, with textbooks and professors sharing their methods over generations. After evidence-based medicine was established as the new form of medical science, the art and science of medicine had to be connected. As a result, by the end of the 20th century, health care had become highly dependent on technology. From electronic medical records, telemedicine, three-dimensional printing, algorithms, and sensors, technology has started to influence medical decisions and the lives of patients. While digital health technologies might be considered a threat to the art of medicine, I argue that advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, will initiate the real era of the art of medicine. Through the use of reinforcement learning, artificial intelligence could become the stethoscope of the 21st century. If we embrace these tools, the real art of medicine will begin now with the era of artificial intelligence.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Advances in AI software and hardware, especially deep learning algorithms and the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power their training, have led to a recent and rapidly increasing interest in medical AI applications. In clinical diagnostics, AI-based computer vision approaches are poised to revolutionize image-based diagnostics, while other AI subtypes have begun to show similar promise in various diagnostic modalities. In some areas, such as clinical genomics, a specific type of AI algorithm known as deep learning is used to process large and complex genomic datasets. In this review, we first summarize the main classes of problems that AI systems are well suited to solve and describe the clinical diagnostic tasks that benefit from these solutions. Next, we focus on emerging methods for specific tasks in clinical genomics, including variant calling, genome annotation and variant classification, and phenotype-to-genotype correspondence. Finally, we end with a discussion on the future potential of AI in individualized medicine applications, especially for risk prediction in common complex diseases, and the challenges, limitations, and biases that must be carefully addressed for the successful deployment of AI in medical applications, particularly those utilizing human genetics and genomics data.", "Background Deep learning (DL) algorithms are gaining extensive attention for their excellent performance in image recognition tasks. DL models can automatically make a quantitative assessment of complex medical image characteristics and achieve increased accuracy in diagnosis with higher efficiency. Purpose To determine the feasibility of using a DL approach to predict clinically negative axillary lymph node metastasis from US images in patients with primary breast cancer. Materials and Methods A data set of US images in patients with primary breast cancer with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes from Tongji Hospital (974 imaging studies from 2016 to 2018, 756 patients) and an independent test set from Hubei Cancer Hospital (81 imaging studies from 2018 to 2019, 78 patients) were collected. Axillary lymph node status was confirmed with pathologic examination. Three different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) of Inception V3, Inception-ResNet V2, and ResNet-101 architectures were trained on 90% of the Tongji Hospital data set and tested on the remaining 10%, as well as on the independent test set. The performance of the models was compared with that of five radiologists. The models' performance was analyzed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic curves, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs), and heat maps. Results The best-performing CNN model, Inception V3, achieved an AUC of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83, 0.95) in the prediction of the final clinical diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis in the independent test set. The model achieved 85% sensitivity (35 of 41 images; 95% CI: 70%, 94%) and 73% specificity (29 of 40 images; 95% CI: 56%, 85%), and the radiologists achieved 73% sensitivity (30 of 41 images; 95% CI: 57%, 85%; P = .17) and 63% specificity (25 of 40 images; 95% CI: 46%, 77%; P = .34). Conclusion Using US images from patients with primary breast cancer, deep learning models can effectively predict clinically negative axillary lymph node metastasis. Artificial intelligence may provide an early diagnostic strategy for lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

Variation in all IQ domains was not linear with time and was best characterized with the coefficient of variation (SD/mean) for each individual. Mixed-effects regressions were used to determine whether IQ was associated with clinical features. Models were controlled for variation in test version, participant identification, and test administrator.\nMean verbal, performance, and full-scale IQs were 81.77, 75.98, and 82.02, respectively, with a consistent discrepancy between verbal and performance IQs. Mean (SD) verbal, performance, and full-scale coefficient of variations were 0.07 (0.04), 0.09 (0.05), and 0.06 (0.02), respectively. IQ varied about a mean, with no clear trajectory, indicating no clear patterns of improvement or decline over time. EEG lateralization and behavioral issues were consistently associated with IQ.\nThe observed variation in IQ in Gaucher disease type 3 across the cohort and within single individuals over time may be characteristic of other neuronopathic diseases. Therefore, to reliably use IQ as an efficacy measure in any clinical trial of neurotherapeutics, a normal variation range must be established to assess the clinical relevance of any IQ change.", "To provide an overview of studies on substance use and substance use disorder (SUD) in individuals with mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning (MID-BIF).\nMany individuals with MID-BIF use tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. On average, rates of substance use and SUD are similar to or even higher than those in peers with average intelligence. Individuals with MID-BIF are overrepresented in (forensic) addiction care. Several instruments are now available for the assessment of SUD and its risk factors in this target group. Prevention and intervention programs have been shown feasible and with promising outcomes, although the evidence base is still small. Professionals in addiction care and intellectual disability care facilities show deficiencies in skills in addressing SUD in clients with MID-BIF.\nResearch in this area is still in its infancy, though an increasing number of studies show promising outcomes regarding case identification, assessment, and treatment of SUD in intellectual disability. Policy and practice should be adapted to the characteristics of individuals with MID-BIF.", "Certain subgroups of patients may be particularly vulnerable to cognitive decline after treatment with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). The objective of this study was to identify predictors of cognitive functioning changes within the first 6 months after HCT. Fifty-eight adults treated with allogeneic HCT (53% male, mean 48 years of age) completed neuropsychological tests of learning/memory, psychomotor efficiency/processing speed, and executive functioning/working memory at three time points: pre-HCT and day 100 and 6 months post transplant. On average, there was significant improvement in learning/memory (p\u2009=\u20090.002), psychomotor efficiency/processing speed (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and executive functioning/working memory (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), at 6 months. Multilevel modeling identified predictors of divergence from this trajectory; Karnofsky performance status <80 was associated with worsening learning/memory over time; peak severity of acute graft-versus-host disease >=Grade 2 was associated with worsening psychomotor efficiency/processing speed; and greater years of education predicted a faster improvement in psychomotor efficiency/processing speed. Other factors were associated with cognitive functioning over time: higher intelligence quotient (IQ) was associated with better cognitive functioning, and older age, being male, and greater pretransplant comorbidities were associated with worse cognitive functioning. Overall, cognitive performance appears to improve over the first 6 months after transplant. However, pretransplant and posttransplant factors may influence this trajectory.", "Artificial intelligence/Machine learning (AI/ML) is transforming all spheres of our life, including the healthcare system. Application of AI/ML has a potential to vastly enhance the reach of diabetes care thereby making it more efficient. The huge burden of diabetes cases in India represents a unique set of problems, and provides us with a unique opportunity in terms of potential availability of data. Harnessing this data using electronic medical records, by all physicians, can put India at the forefront of research in this area. Application of AI/ML would provide insights to our problems as well as may help us to devise tailor-made solutions for the same.", "Poor cognitive abilities and low intellectual quotient (IQ) are associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts and suicide mortality. However, knowledge of how this association develops across the life-course is limited. Our study aims to establish whether individuals who died by suicide by mid-adulthood are distinguishable by their child-to-adolescence cognitive trajectories.\nParticipants were from the 1958 British Birth Cohort and were assessed for academic performance at ages 7, 11, and 16 and intelligence at 11 years. Suicides occurring by September 2012 were identified from linked national death certificates. We compared mean mathematics and reading abilities and rate of change across 7-16 years for individuals who died by suicide v. those still alive, with and without adjustment for potential early-life confounding factors. Analyses were based on 14 505 participants.\nFifty-five participants (48 males) had died by suicide by age 54 years. While males who died by suicide did not differ from participants still alive in reading scores at age 7 [effect size (g) = -0.04, p = 0.759], their reading scores had a less steep improvement up to age 16 compared to other participants. Adjustments for early-life confounding factors explained these differences. A similar pattern was observed for mathematics scores. There was no difference between individuals who died by suicide v. participants still alive on intelligence at 11 years.\nWhile no differences in tests of academic performance and IQ were observed, individuals who died by suicide had a less steep improvement in reading abilities over time compared to same-age peers.", "To evaluate the opinion and assessment of radiologists, surgeons and medical students on a number of important topics regarding the future of radiology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), turf battles, teleradiology and 3D-printing.\nAn online questionnaire was created using the SurveyMonkey platform targeting radiologists, students and surgeons throughout the German speaking part of Switzerland. A total of 170 people participated in the survey (59 radiologists, 56 surgeons and 55 students). Statistical analysis was carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison post-hoc tests.\nWhile the majority of participants agreed that AI should be included as a support system in radiology (Likert scale 0-10: Median value 8), surgeons were less supportive than radiologists (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Students saw a potential threat of AI as more likely than radiologists did (p\u2009=\u20090.041). When asked whether they were concerned about \"turf losses\" from radiology to other disciplines, radiologists were much more likely to agree than students (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Of the students that do not intend to specialize in radiology, 26 % stated that AI was one of the reasons. Surgeons advocate the use of teleradiology.\nWith regard to AI, radiologists expect their workflow to become more efficient and tend to support the use of AI, whereas medical students and surgeons tend to be more skeptical towards this technology. Medical students see AI as a potential threat to diagnostic radiologists, while radiologists themselves are rather afraid of turf losses.", "Recently, electronic skin that mimics human skin in measuring tactile stimuli, temperature, and humidity and having a self-healing function was developed. Furthermore, with the advances in the field of artificial intelligence and health monitoring, various materials and methods have been studied for e-skin. The limitations to work on actual human skin include device flexibility and large-area applications through array structures, and many studies are underway to overcome these problems. Polymeric materials containing ionic liquids can be used to easily fabricate devices in the solid state. They are highly sensitive to both pressure and temperature, making them suitable for multi-sensing devices. Resistive and capacitive sensors have the advantage of having a simple structure, which makes them easy to fabricate. In a single device, both types work well. For resistive sensors, the temperature sensitivity (1.1/\u00b0C) is relatively high. Conversely, capacitive sensors have a low temperature sensitivity (0.3/\u00b0C). However, they have the advantage of being uniformly variable under each condition and having a smaller error range. In the array structure, independent flex and thermo sensors are arranged repeatedly. The resistive type shows changes in temperature and bending, but in the capacitive type, it is difficult to obtain results from the pixels due to parasitic capacitance.", "Most frail older persons are living at home, and we face difficulties in achieving seamless monitoring to detect adverse health changes. Even more important, this lack of follow-up could have a negative impact on the living choices made by older individuals and their care partners. People could give up their homes for the more reassuring environment of a medicalized living facility. We have developed a low-cost unobtrusive sensor-based solution to trigger automatic alerts in case of an acute event or subtle changes over time. It could facilitate older adults' follow-up in their own homes, and thus support independent living.\nThe primary objective of this prospective open-label study is to evaluate the relevance of the automatic alerts generated by our artificial intelligence-driven monitoring solution as judged by the recipients: older adults, caregivers, and professional support workers. The secondary objective is to evaluate its ability to detect subtle functional and cognitive decline and major medical events.\nThe primary outcome will be evaluated for each successive 2-month follow-up period to estimate the progression of our learning algorithm performance over time. In total, 25 frail or disabled participants, aged 75 years and above and living alone in their own homes, will be enrolled for a 6-month follow-up period.\nThe first phase with 5 participants for a 4-month feasibility period has been completed and the expected completion date for the second phase of the study (20 participants for 6 months) is July 2020.\nThe originality of our real-life project lies in the choice of the primary outcome and in our user-centered evaluation. We will evaluate the relevance of the alerts and the algorithm performance over time according to the end users. The first-line recipients of the information are the older adults and their care partners rather than health care professionals.

The utility of CMR as a non-invasive imaging tool for evaluation of CHD have been growing exponentially over the past decade. The algorithms based on artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular, deep learning, have rapidly become a methodology of choice for analyzing CMR. A wide range of applications for AI have been developed to tackle challenges in various aspects of CMR, and significant advances have also been made from image acquisition to image analysis and diagnosis. We include an overview of AI definitions, different architectures, and details on well-known methods. This paper reviews the major deep learning concepts used for analyses of patients with CHD. In the end, we have summarized a list of open challenges and concerns to be considered for future studies.", "In this study, we propose that infant social cognition may 'bootstrap' the successive development of domain-general cognition in line with the cultural intelligence hypothesis. Using a longitudinal design, 6-month-old infants (N\u00a0=\u00a0118) were assessed on two basic social cognitive tasks targeting the abilities to share attention with others and understanding other peoples' actions. At 10\u00a0months, we measured the quality of the child's social learning environment, indexed by parent's abilities to provide scaffolding behaviors during a problem-solving task. Eight months later, the children were followed up with a cognitive test-battery, including tasks of inhibitory control and working memory. Our results showed that better infant social action understanding interacted with better parental scaffolding skills in predicting simple inhibitory control in toddlerhood. This suggests that infants' who are better at understanding other's actions are also better equipped to make the most of existing social learning opportunities, which in turn may benefit future non-social cognitive outcomes.", "This study investigated the clinical characteristics, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, MRI follow-up, and prognosis of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) during remission induction chemotherapy.\nWe analyzed the age, gender, PRES symptoms and signs, cranial MRI findings, therapeutic effect, and prognosis of children with ALL who developed PRES during chemotherapy from January 2010 to December 2013 at the Hematology Oncology Center of Beijing Children's Hospital. Changes in cranial MRI findings were analyzed, and intelligence (IQ) and cognitive function were evaluated using the Wechsler Scale and the Wisconsin Card Score Test after the children completed chemotherapy.\nThere were 850 children with newly diagnosed ALL in this period; 13 (1.5%), 6 boys and 7 girls, developed PRES. All were diagnosed as B-cell ALL. The median age at PRES onset was 7 years (2-11 years). The median day of PRES onset was day 28 (day 17-34) of remission induction chemotherapy. Of the 13 children with PRES onset and seizures, 4 had visual disturbances and 2 had consciousness disturbances. Cranial MRI showed hyperintensity in the subcortical white matter on T2-weighted axial and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. The lesion locations were as follows: occipital lobe, 12 (92.3%) patients; frontal lobe, 7 (53.8%) patients; temporal lobe, 5 (38.4%) patients; parietal lobe, 3 (23.1%) patients; and cerebellum, 1 (7.7%) patient. There were 8 (61.5%) patients with vasogenic edema and 5 (38.5%) with cytotoxic edema. After treatment, all children recovered within one month, when their PRES symptoms were relieved, they continued to receive chemotherapy. However, 1 child (1.07%) died of severe central nervous system infection one year after PRES treatment, and 3 (25%) had recurrent seizures and were diagnosed with epilepsy after three months of PRES treatment. Their cranial MRIs showed cytotoxic edema, which was acute stage on day 15, with aggravated lesions on cranial MRI. The cranial MRI lesions returned to normal at one month in 3 (23.1%) patients, at three months in 6 (46.1%) patients, at one year in 8 (61.5%) patients, and at two years in 12 (92.3%) patients. The 12 surviving children all returned to school, and their full-scale, verbal, and performance IQs were normal, with no significant differences in intelligence or cognitive function compared with children with ALL without PRES during the same period.\nPRES can occur during remission induction chemotherapy treatment of children with ALL, but the incidence is low. Cranial MRI can be used for diagnosis and to characterize lesions. The children recover about a month after treatment, and cranial MRI lesions return to normal within two years. The time for complete resolution of MRI lesions differs, and children with cytotoxic edema have worse prognosis with sequelae, such as epilepsy, which requires close monitoring. PRES does not affect intelligence or cognitive development.", "Objective: This study examined premorbid ability estimate concordance using Test of Premorbid Functioning predicted Full Scale Intelligent Quotient (TOPF-IQ) and Wide Range Achievement Test-Fourth Edition Word Reading (WRAT4-WR). Method: The sample (N = 145) was 28% female with average age and education of 40.6 and 13.2 years, respectively. Outpatient neuropsychological evaluations were conducted in a rehabilitation setting. Measures included the TOPF, WRAT4-WR, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition, and other neuropsychological tests. Non-WAIS measures defined impairment groups. Analyses included t tests, pairwise correlations, concordance correlation coefficients, and root mean square differences. Results: TOPF-IQ, WRAT4-WR, and Full Scale Intelligent Quotient scores were not significantly different but were lower than normative mean. TOPF-IQ and WRAT4-WR showed acceptable agreement (concordance correlation coefficient = .92; root mean square difference = 5.9). Greater premorbid-current ability differences were observed in the impaired group. TOPF-IQ and WRAT4-WR showed lower but similar agreement with Full Scale Intelligence Quotient in the unimpaired group. Conclusions: Findings support the WRAT4-WR in predicting premorbid ability in rehabilitation settings.", "The first International Society of Atopic Dermatitis (ISAD) global meeting dedicated to atopic dermatitis (AD) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) was held in Geneva, Switzerland in April 2019. A total of 30 participants were present at the meeting, including those from 17 SSA countries, representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Foundation for Dermatology (IFD) (a committee of the International League of Dermatological Societies, ILDS www.ilds.org), the Fondation pour la Dermatite Atopique, as well as specialists in telemedicine, artificial intelligence and therapeutic patient education (TPE).\nAD is one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin diseases in SSA. Besides neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) with a dermatological presentation, AD requires closer attention from the WHO and national Departments of Health.\nA roadmap has been defined with top priorities such as access to essential medicines and devices for AD care, in particular emollients, better education of primary healthcare workers for adequate triage (e.g. better educational materials for skin diseases in pigmented skin generally and AD in particular, especially targeted to Africa), involvement of traditional healers and to a certain extent also patient education, bearing in mind the barriers to effective healthcare faced in SSA countries such as travel distances to health facilities, limited resources and the lack of dermatological expertise. In addition, several initiatives concerning AD research in SSA were discussed and should be implemented in close collaboration with the WHO and assessed at follow-up meetings, in particular, at the next ISAD meeting in Seoul, South Korea and African Society of Dermatology and Venereology (ASDV) meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, both in 2020.", "Automated vehicles will provide greater transport convenience and interconnectivity, increase mobility options to young and elderly people, and reduce traffic congestion and emissions. However, the largest obstacle towards the deployment of automated vehicles on public roads is their safety evaluation and validation. Undeniably, the role of cameras and Artificial Intelligence-based (AI) vision is vital in the perception of the driving environment and road safety. Although a significant number of studies on the detection and tracking of vehicles have been conducted, none of them focused on the role of vertical vehicle dynamics. For the first time, this paper analyzes and discusses the influence of road anomalies and vehicle suspension on the performance of detecting and tracking driving objects. To this end, we conducted an extensive road field study and validated a computational tool for performing the assessment using simulations. A parametric study revealed the cases where AI-based vision underperforms and may significantly degrade the safety performance of AVs.", "Despite great advances, molecular cancer pathology is often limited to the use of a small number of biomarkers rather than the whole transcriptome, partly due to computational challenges. Here, we introduce a novel architecture of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that is capable of simultaneous inference of various properties of biological samples, through multi-task and transfer learning. It encodes the whole transcription profile into a strikingly low-dimensional latent vector of size 8, and then recovers mRNA and miRNA expression profiles, tissue and disease type from this vector. This latent space is significantly better than the original gene expression profiles for discriminating samples based on their tissue and disease. We employed this architecture on mRNA transcription profiles of 10750 clinical samples from 34 classes (one healthy and 33 different types of cancer) from 27 tissues. Our method significantly outperforms prior works and classical machine learning approaches in predicting tissue-of-origin, normal or disease state and cancer type of each sample. For tissues with more than one type of cancer, it reaches 99.4% accuracy in identifying the correct cancer subtype. We also show this system is very robust against noise and missing values. Collectively, our results highlight applications of artificial intelligence in molecular cancer pathology and oncological research.

The fuzzy logic (FL) provides an effective means for dealing with uncertainties in the health decision-making process; therefore, FL-based CDSS becomes a very powerful tool for data and knowledge management, being able to think like an expert clinician. This work proposes an FL-based CDSS for the evaluation of renal function in posttransplant patients.\nBased on the data provided by the Department of Nephrology of the University Hospital Federico II of Naples, a statistical sample is selected according to appropriate inclusion criteria. Four fuzzy inference systems are implemented monitoring the renal function by the level of proteinuria and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\nThe systems show an accuracy of more than 90% and the outputs are provided through easy to read graphics, so that physicians can intuitively monitor the patient's clinical status, with the objective to improve drugs dosage and reduce medication errors.\nWe propose that the CDSSs for the assessment and follow-up of kidney-transplanted patients built in this study are applicable to clinical practice.", "Flexible textile-based supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted a lot of attention, with the artificial intelligence technology and smart wearable electronic textiles developing rapidly. However, energy-storage performance of common textile-based SCs is always restricted with the low-dimensional substrates (i.e., one-dimensional fibers or two-dimensional fabrics), and hence flexible textile-based SCs with multifarious hierarchical substrates are highly desired. Herein, a multidimensional hierarchical fabric electrode model with a bionic fiber microarray structure has been designed, inspired by the \"grasp effect\" of the sophisticated arrangement structures of hedgehog spines, and the bionic assembled SCs exhibit an enhanced specific areal capacitance (245.5 mF/cm2 at 1 mV/cm2), compared with the planar fabric-based SCs (41.6 mF/cm2), and a high energy density (21.82 \u03bcWh/cm2 at 0.4 mW/cm2). Besides, the SCs also show a stable capacitance ratio of 83.9% after 10\u2009000 cycles and a mere capacitance loss under different bending states. As a proof of concept, an all-fabric smart electronic switch is fabricated with self-power and wearable properties, along with some other trial applications. Such a hierarchical fabric with a bionic fiber microarray structure is believed to enhance the performance of the assembled SCs. We foresee that the multidimensional hierarchical fabric would bring more promising prospects for flexible textile-based energy-storage systems and be used in smart wearable textile applications.", "Image-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to assist doctors in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer using ultrasound thyroid images. However, the performance of these systems is strongly dependent on the selection of detection and classification methods. Although there are previous researches on this topic, there is still room for enhancement of the classification accuracy of the existing methods. To address this issue, we propose an artificial intelligence-based method for enhancing the performance of the thyroid nodule classification system. Thus, we extract image features from ultrasound thyroid images in two domains: spatial domain based on deep learning, and frequency domain based on Fast Fourier transform (FFT). Using the extracted features, we perform a cascade classifier scheme for classifying the input thyroid images into either benign (negative) or malign (positive) cases. Through expensive experiments using a public dataset, the thyroid digital image database (TDID) dataset, we show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and produces up-to-date classification results for the thyroid nodule classification problem.", "Although self-expressive creativity is related to cyberbullying, it can also reinforce strengths that contribute to positive adolescent development. Our study concentrated on the relationships between personality traits and self-expressive creativity in the digital domain in an adolescent population. For this, we analyzed the effect of self-esteem and emotional intelligence as assets for positive development related to personality traits and self-expressive creativity.\nThe study population included a total of 742 adolescents that were high-school students in the province of Almer\u00eda, Spain. The following instruments were used: Big Five Inventory (BFI) to evaluate the five broad personality factors, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), Expression, Management, and Emotion Recognition Evaluation Scale (TMMS-24), and the Creative Behavior Questionnaire: Digital (CBQD).\nThe cluster analysis revealed the existence of two profiles of adolescents based on their personality traits. The analysis showed that the group with the highest levels of extraversion and openness to experience and lowest levels of neuroticism were those who showed the highest scores in self-esteem, clarity, and emotional repair, as well as in self-expressive creativity. Higher scores in neuroticism and lower scores in extraversion and openness to experience showed a direct negative effect on self-expressive creativity and indirect effect through self-esteem and emotional attention, which acted as mediators in series.\nTo counteract certain characteristics that increase adolescents' vulnerability to social network bullying, a plan must be developed for adequate positive use of the Internet from a creative model that enables digital self-expression for acquiring identity and self-efficacy through the positive influence of peers, which promotes feelings of empowerment and self-affirmation through constructive tasks that reinforce self-esteem and emotional intelligence.", "For the safety assessment of pharmaceuticals, initial data management requires accurate toxicological data acquisition, which is based on regulatory safety studies according to guidelines, and computational systems have been developed under the application of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). In addition to these regulatory toxicology studies, investigative toxicological study data for the selection of lead compound and candidate compound for clinical trials are directed to estimation by computational systems such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and related expert systems. Furthermore, in the \"Go\" or \"No-Go\" decision of drug development, supportive utilization of a scientifically interpretable computational toxicology system is required for human safety evaluation. A pharmaceutical safety evaluator as a related toxicologist who is facing practical decision needs not only a data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that calls for the final consequence but also an explainable AI that can provide comprehensive information necessary for evaluation and can help with decision making. Through the explication and suggestion of information on the mechanism of toxic effects to safety assessment scientists, a subsidiary partnership system for risk assessment is ultimately to be a powerful tool that can indicate project-vector with data weight for the corresponding counterparts. To bridge the gaps between big data and knowledge, multi-dimensional thinking based on philosophical ontology theory is necessary for handling heterogeneous data for integration. In this review, we will explain the current state and future perspective of computational toxicology related to drug safety assessment from the viewpoint of ontology thinking.", "Previous researchers have examined the frequency at which healthy participants obtain one or more low scores on neuropsychological test batteries, proposing five psychometric principles of multivariate base rates: (a) low scores are common, with their frequency contingent on (b) the low score cutoff used, (c) the number of tests administered/interpreted, and (d) the demographic characteristics and (e) intelligence of participants. The current study explored whether these principles applied to high scores as well, using the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS).\nMultivariate base rates of high scores (\u226575th, \u226584th, \u226591st, \u226595th, and \u226598th percentiles) were derived for a three-test, four-test, and full D-KEFS battery, using the adult portion of the normative sample (aged 16-89 years; N = 1050) stratified by education and intelligence. The full D-KEFS battery provides 16 total achievement scores (primary indicators of executive function).\nHigh scores occurred commonly for all batteries. For the three-test battery, 24.1% and 12.4% had 1 or more scores \u226595th percentile and \u226598th percentile, respectively. High scores occurred more often for longer batteries: 61.6%, 72.9%, and 87.8% obtained 1 or more scores \u226584th percentile for the three-test, four-test, and full batteries, respectively. The frequency of high scores increased with more education and higher intelligence.\nThe principles of multivariate base rates also applied to high D-KEFS scores: high scores were common and contingent on the cutoff used, number of tests administered/interpreted, and education/intelligence of examinees. Base rates of high scores may help clinicians identify true cognitive strengths and detect cognitive deficits in high functioning people.", "A deep learning algorithm to detect low ejection fraction (EF) using routine 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) has recently been developed and validated. The algorithm was incorporated into the electronic health record (EHR) to automatically screen for low EF, encouraging clinicians to obtain a confirmatory transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) for previously undiagnosed patients, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and treatment.\nTo prospectively evaluate a novel artificial intelligence (AI) screening tool for detecting low EF in primary care practices.\nThe EAGLE trial is a pragmatic two-arm cluster randomized trial (NCT04000087) that will randomize >100 clinical teams (i.e., clusters) to either intervention (access to the new AI screening tool) or control (usual care) at 48 primary care practices across Minnesota and Wisconsin. The trial is expected to involve approximately 400 clinicians and 20,000 patients. The primary endpoint is newly discovered EF \u226450%. Eligible patients will include adults who undergo ECG for any reason and have not been previously diagnosed with low EF. Data will be pulled from the EHR, and no contact will be made with patients. A positive deviance qualitative study and a post-implementation survey will be conducted among select clinicians to identify facilitators and barriers to using the new screening report.\nThis trial will examine the effectiveness of the AI-enabled ECG for detection of asymptomatic low EF in routine primary care practices and will be among the first to prospectively evaluate the value of AI in real-world practice. Its findings will inform future implementation strategies for the translation of other AI-enabled algorithms.", "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown huge superiority over humans in image recognition, speech processing, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis. However, recent studies indicate that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which are designed by attackers to fool deep learning models. Different from real examples, AEs can mislead the model to predict incorrect outputs while hardly be distinguished by human eyes, therefore threaten security-critical deep-learning applications. In recent years, the generation and defense of AEs have become a research hotspot in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) security. This article reviews the latest research progress of AEs. First, we introduce the concept, cause, characteristics, and evaluation metrics of AEs, then give a survey on the state-of-the-art AE generation methods with the discussion of advantages and disadvantages. After that, we review the existing defenses and discuss their limitations. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges on AEs are prospected.", "This review article provides an overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as it relates to cardiovascular health care.\nAn overview of the terminology and algorithms used in ML as it relates to health care are provided by the author. Articles published up to August 1, 2019, in the field of AI and ML in cardiovascular medicine are also reviewed and placed in the context of the potential role these approaches will have in clinical practice in the future.\nAI is a broader term referring to the ability of machines to perform intelligent tasks, and ML is a subset of AI that refers to the ability of machines to learn independently and make accurate predictions. An expanding body of literature has been published using ML in cardiovascular health care. Moreover, ML has been applied in the settings of automated imaging interpretation, natural language processing and data extraction from electronic health records, and predictive analytics. Examples include automated interpretation of chest roentgenograms, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and angiography; identification of patients with early heart failure using clinical notes evaluated by ML; and predicting mortality or complications following percutaneous or surgical cardiovascular procedures.\nAlthough there is an expanding body of literature on AI and ML in cardiovascular medicine, the future these fields will have in clinical practice remains to be paved. In particular, there is a promising role in providing automated imaging interpretation, automated data extraction and quality control, and clinical risk prediction, although these techniques require further refinement and evaluation.", "This cohort-sequential study explored the components of working memory that underlie math calculation in elementary school children who are monolingual (English) or English language learners (ELLs) whose first language is Spanish. To this end, children (N =\u00a0789) in grades 1, 2, and 3 at wave 1 were administered a battery of math, vocabulary, reading and cognitive (short-term memory [STM], working memory [WM], rapid naming, and inhibition) measures. The battery of tests was administered again one year and two years later to the same participants. Three important findings emerged. First, along with naming speed, the results suggest that growth in the executive component of WM was significantly related to growth in calculation performance. Second, performance on measures of reading, fluid intelligence, naming speed and executive processes in wave 1 were significantly related to wave 3 math calculation performance. Finally, the full latent growth model showed that monolingual and ELL children were statistically comparable in computation at wave 3. Thus, strong support was found for the notion that the executive component of WM was related to math computation but weak support for the notion ELL children experienced a math achievement gap.", "Vehicular traffic noise is the main source of noise pollution in major cities around the globe. A reliable and accurate method for the estimation of vehicular traffic noise is therefore essential for creating a healthy noise-free environment. In this study, 2 linear (simple average and weighted average) and 2-nonlinear (neural network and neuro-fuzzy) ensemble models were developed by combining the outputs of three Artificial Intelligence (AI) based non-linear models; Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and one Multilinear regression (MLR) model to enhance the performance of the single black box models in predicting vehicular traffic noise of Nicosia city, North Cyprus. In this way, first a nonlinear sensitivity analysis was applied to select the most relevant and dominant input parameters of the traffic data obtained from 12 observation points in the study area. The most dominant parameters in order of their importance were determined to be number of cars, number of van/pickups, number of trucks, average speed and number of buses. Classifying the number of vehicles into five categories before feeding the traffic data into the AI models was observed to improve performance of the single models up to 29% in the verification phase. Out of the four ensembles models developed, the nonlinear ANFIS ensemble was found to be the most robust by improving the performance of ANFIS, FFNN, SVR and MLR models in the verification stage by 11%, 19%, 21% and 31%, respectively.", "Organizational leaders are recognizing the urgent need to mitigate clinician burnout. They face difficult choices, knowing that burnout threatens the quality and safety of care and the sustainability of their organizations. Creating cultures and system improvements that support the workforce and diminish burnout are vital leadership skills. The motivation to heal draws many health professionals to their chosen work. Further, research suggests that compassion creates a sense of personal reward and professional satisfaction. Although many organizations stress compassion in mission and vision statements, their strategies to enhance well-being largely ignore compassion as a source of joy and connection to purpose.Passage of the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) Act in 2009 and the Affordable Care Act in 2010 ushered in a new era in healthcare. Little is known about how changes in the healthcare delivery system related to these legislative milestones have influenced health professionals' capacity to offer compassionate care. Further, advances such as artificial intelligence and virtual care modalities brought more attention to the elements that form the clinician-patient relationship.This study analyzed the views of U.S. healthcare providers on the status of compassionate healthcare compared with 2010. Postulating that compassion is inversely correlated with burnout, we studied this relationship and contributing factors. Our review of evidence-based initiatives suggests that leaders must define the organizational conditions and implement processes that support professionals' innate compassion and contribute to their well-being rather than address burnout later through remedial strategies.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) machines hold the world's curiosity captive. Futuristic television shows like West World are set in desert lands against pink sunsets where sleek, autonomous AI fulfill every human need, desire, and kink. But I, Robot, a movie where robots turn against the humans they serve, reminds us that AI is precarious. Academicians who study how AI interacts with tort law, such as Jessica Allain, David Vladeck, and Sjur Dyrkoltbotn, claim that the current legal regime is incapable of addressing the liability issues AI present. Both Allain and Vladeck focus their research on whether tort law can accommodate claims against fully autonomous AI machines, while Dyrkoltbotn explores how AI can be leveraged to help plaintiffs identify the genesis of their injuries. The solution this article presents is not exclusively tailored to fully autonomous AI and does not identify how technology can be used in tort claims. It instead demonstrates that the current tort law regime can provide relief to plaintiffs who are injured by AI machines. In particular, this article argues that the manner in which Watson for Oncology is designed presents a new context in which courts should adopt a per se rule of liability that favors plaintiffs who bring damage claims against AI machines by expanding the definition of what it means for a device to be unreasonably dangerous.", "Developmental processes in the placenta and the fetal brain are shaped by the similar biological signals. Evidence accumulates that adaptive responses of the placenta may influence central nervous system development. We hypothesize that placental mtDNA content at birth is associated with intelligence in childhood. In addition, we investigate if intra-pair differences in mtDNA content are associated with intra-pair differences in intelligence.\nRelative mtDNA content was measured using qPCR in placental tissue of 375 children of the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Intelligence was assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) between 8 and 15\u00a0years old. We accounted for sex, gestational age, birth weight, birth year, zygosity and chorionicity, cord insertion, age at measurement, indicators of socioeconomic status, smoking during pregnancy, and urban environment.\nIn multivariable adjusted mixed modelling analysis, each doubling in placental mtDNA content was associated with 2.0 points (95% CI 0.02 to 3.9; p\u2009=\u20090.05) higher total and 2.3 points (95% CI 0.2 to 4.3; p\u2009=\u20090.03) higher performance IQ in childhood. We observed no association between mtDNA content and verbal intelligence. Intra-pair differences in mtDNA content and IQ were significantly (p\u2009=\u20090.01) correlated in monozygotic-monochorionic twin pairs, showing that the twin with the highest mtDNA content was 1.9 times more likely (p\u2009=\u20090.05) to have the highest IQ. This was not observed in dichorionic twin pairs.\nWe provide the first evidence that placental mtDNA content is associated with childhood intelligence. This emphasizes the importance of placental mitochondrial function during in utero life on fetal brain development with long-lasting consequences.", "The present study aimed to conduct a real-time automatic analysis of two important surgical phases, which are continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC), nuclear extraction, and three other surgical phases of cataract surgery using artificial intelligence technology. A total of 303 cases of cataract surgery registered in the clinical database of the Ophthalmology Department of Tsukazaki Hospital were used as a dataset. Surgical videos were downsampled to a resolution of 299\u2009\u00d7\u2009168 at 1 FPS to image each frame. Next, based on the start and end times of each surgical phase recorded by an ophthalmologist, the obtained images were labeled correctly. Using the data, a neural network model, known as InceptionV3, was developed to identify the given surgical phase for each image. Then, the obtained images were processed in chronological order using the neural network model, where the moving average of the output result of five consecutive images was derived. The class with the maximum output value was defined as the surgical phase. For each surgical phase, the time at which a phase was first identified was defined as the start time, and the time at which a phase was last identified was defined as the end time. The performance was evaluated by finding the mean absolute error between the start and end times of each important phase recorded by the ophthalmologist as well as the start and end times determined by the model. The correct response rate of the cataract surgical phase classification was 90.7% for CCC, 94.5% for nuclear extraction, and 97.9% for other phases, with a mean correct response rate of 96.5%. The errors between each phase's start and end times recorded by the ophthalmologist and those determined by the neural network model were as follows: CCC's start and end times, 3.34\u2009seconds and 4.43\u2009seconds, respectively and nuclear extraction's start and end times, 7.21\u2009seconds and 6.04\u2009seconds, respectively, with a mean of 5.25\u2009seconds. The neural network model used in this study was able to perform the classification of the surgical phase by only referring to the last 5\u2009seconds of video images. Therefore, our method has performed like a real-time classification.", "Emerging research on the use of new technology suggests that internet use is generally associated with high levels of efficiency among older adults in the following areas: quality of life, mood, positive psychological well-being, and the individual and societal costs of caring for them. However, there is little empirical evidence specifically concerning the causal effects of older adults' internet use on their depression level. There is a need for more replication studies to help confirm that the emerging evidence on the impact of internet use is accurate and applicable to different populations and in different situations.\nUsing national data from the China Family Panel Study in 2016, this study helps to fill the above mentioned research gap. This study followed a two-step analytical strategy to empirically examine the association between internet use and reported depression in older adults. In the first step, we estimated a binary logistic regression model with internet use as the dependent variable and 8 demographic and socioeconomic factors as the confounding variables. In the second step, we performed a propensity score analysis to control for potential bias using the confounding variables confirmed in the first step.\nThe results show that older adults who reported internet use have lower depression levels than did those who did not use the internet, with adjustments made for gender, age, urban or rural residence, pension status, educational background, physical health, life satisfaction, and intelligence level.\nThese findings suggest that it is critical to advocate for technology-based policies and programs that promote older adults' internet use to improve their social well-being, which can also serve as a policy strategy to help alleviate older adults' depression.", "The multiple demand network (MDN) is conceptualized as the core processing system for multitasking. Increasing evidence also provides strong support for the involvement of the MDN in fluid intelligence (gF), that is, the ability to solve new problems. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of declining intelligence in old age are poorly explored, particularly whether maintenance of the functional architecture of the MDN can characterize superior intelligence in successful aging. Here, we used eigenvector centrality (EC) to explore the resting-state functional architecture of the MDN in terms of its communication across the entire brain. We found gF to be negatively associated with age and that the MDN EC competitively mediated age-related decline in gF over the aging lifespan, suggesting that excessive cross-talk from the MDN is deleterious for intelligence. Critically, older individuals with comparable MDN EC as younger individuals exhibited superior gF compared with their age-matched counterparts. Taken together, these data provide support for the maintenance of youth-like functional architecture of the MDN and its implication for superior intelligence in successful aging.", "One of the objectives in the field of artificial intelligence for some decades has been the development of artificial agents capable of coexisting in harmony with people and other systems. The computing research community has made efforts to design artificial agents capable of doing tasks the way people do, tasks requiring cognitive mechanisms such as planning, decision-making, and learning. The application domains of such software agents are evident nowadays. Humans are experiencing the inclusion of artificial agents in their environment as unmanned vehicles, intelligent houses, and humanoid robots capable of caring for people. In this context, research in the field of machine ethics has become more than a hot topic. Machine ethics focuses on developing ethical mechanisms for artificial agents to be capable of engaging in moral behavior. However, there are still crucial challenges in the development of truly Artificial Moral Agents. This paper aims to show the current status of Artificial Moral Agents by analyzing models proposed over the past two decades. As a result of this review, a taxonomy to classify Artificial Moral Agents according to the strategies and criteria used to deal with ethical problems is proposed. The presented review aims to illustrate (1) the complexity of designing and developing ethical mechanisms for this type of agent, and (2) that there is a long way to go (from a technological perspective) before this type of artificial agent can replace human judgment in difficult, surprising or ambiguous moral situations.", "This contribution to the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Epilepsy & Behavior addresses the topic of epilepsy and intelligence, an early focus of interest in the history of the neuropsychology of epilepsy. The path through which the earliest measures of intelligence found their way to epilepsy research is reviewed followed by an overview of the subsequent themes of research, points of disagreement, advances in research using measures of intelligence, and developing awareness of the limitations associated with reliance on intelligence tests. Special Issue: Epilepsy & Behavior's 20th Anniversary.", "The concept of IRT (Item Response Theory), offering several models which at least guarantee if they hold, that a scoring rule in question is indeed fair, can be referred to in regard to the pertinent scoring rule of the IQ (intelligence quotient) in many intelligence test-batteries. Muller's continuous Rasch model (1987, 1999) applies. Analyses were carried out for three test-batteries, that is the German and the English version of AID 3 and a respective version for group administration, to show this in an exemplary way. Sample sizes comprised 431, 761, and 2278, respectively. Above all, the graphical model check disclosed a serious misfit of the model: There is no support for the notion that the respective scoring rule is fair. Detailed inspections give the impression that essentially calculating the sum of the subtest scores mixes (at least) two components, \"intelligence\" and \"willingness to achieve in unchallenging tasks.\" Practitioners should be assailed by doubts that all other intelligence test-batteries in use, which are not evaluated accordingly, do score fair.", "Growth and development can be determined by cervical vertebrae stages that were defined on the cephalometric radiograph. Artificial intelligence has the ability to perform a variety of activities, such as prediction-classification in many areas of life, by using different algorithms, In this study, we aimed to determine cervical vertebrae stages (CVS) for growth and development periods by the frequently used seven artificial intelligence classifiers, and to compare the performance of these algorithms with each other.\nCephalometric radiographs, that were obtained from 300 individuals aged between 8 and 17\u2009years were included in our study. Nineteen reference points were defined on second, third, and 4th cervical vertebrae, and 20 different linear measurements were taken. Seven algorithms of artificial intelligence that are frequently used in the field of classification were selected and compared. These algorithms are k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (Tree), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (Log.Regr.) algorithms.\nAccording to confusion matrices decision tree, CSV1 (97.1%)-CSV2 (90.5%), SVM: CVS3 (73.2%)-CVS4 (58.5%), and kNN: CVS 5 (60.9%)-CVS 6 (78.7%) were the algorithms with the highest accuracy in determining cervical vertebrae stages. The ANN algorithm was observed to have the second-highest accuracy values (93%, 89.7%, 68.8%, 55.6%, and 78%, respectively) in determining all stages except CVS5 (47.4% third highest accuracy value). According to the average rank of the algorithms in predicting the CSV classes, ANN was the most stable algorithm with its 2.17 average rank.\nIn our experimental study, kNN and Log.Regr. algorithms had the lowest accuracy values. SVM-RF-Tree and NB algorithms had varying accuracy values. ANN could be the preferred method for determining CVS.", "Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to represent and attribute mental states to oneself and others. So far, research regarding ToM processing across adolescence is scarce. Existing studies either yield inconsistent results or did not or not thoroughly investigate aspects like higher order ToM and associated neuropsychological variables which the current study tried to address. 643 typically developing early, middle, and late adolescents (age groups 13-14; 15-16; 17-18) performed cognitive and affective ToM tasks as well as neuropsychological tasks tapping the cognitive or affective domain. Regarding both ToM types, 15- to 16-year-olds and 17- to 18-year-olds outperformed 13- to 14-year-olds, whereas females were superior regarding cognitive ToM. Across adolescence, cognitive and affective ToM correlated with attention and affective intelligence, whereas working memory, language comprehension, and figural intelligence additionally correlated with cognitive ToM. In early adolescence, attention correlated with both ToM types, whereas cognitive ToM further correlated with language comprehension and affective ToM with verbal intelligence, verbal fluency, and verbal flexibility. In middle and late adolescence, affective intelligence correlated with both ToM types, whereas cognitive ToM additionally correlated with working memory, language comprehension, and figural intelligence. The current study shows a developmental step regarding cognitive and affective ToM in middle adolescence as well as gender differences in cognitive ToM processing. Associations between neuropsychological variables and ToM processing were shown across adolescence and within age groups. Results give new insights into social cognition in adolescence and are well supported by neuroscientific and neurobiological studies regarding ToM and the integration of cognitive and affective processes.", "Corneal confocal microscopy is a rapid non-invasive ophthalmic imaging technique that identifies peripheral and central neurodegenerative disease. Quantification of corneal sub-basal nerve plexus morphology, however, requires either time-consuming manual annotation or a less-sensitive automated image analysis approach. We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence-based, deep learning algorithm for the quantification of nerve fibre properties relevant to the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy and to compare it with a validated automated analysis program, ACCMetrics.\nOur deep learning algorithm, which employs a convolutional neural network with data augmentation, was developed for the automated quantification of the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus for the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy. The algorithm was trained using a high-end graphics processor unit on 1698 corneal confocal microscopy images; for external validation, it was further tested on 2137 images. The algorithm was developed to identify total nerve fibre length, branch points, tail points, number and length of nerve segments, and fractal numbers. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to determine the AUC for ACCMetrics and our algorithm for the diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficients for our algorithm were superior to those for ACCMetrics for total corneal nerve fibre length (0.933 vs 0.825), mean length per segment (0.656 vs 0.325), number of branch points (0.891 vs 0.570), number of tail points (0.623 vs 0.257), number of nerve segments (0.878 vs 0.504) and fractals (0.927 vs 0.758). In addition, our proposed algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.83, specificity of 0.87 and sensitivity of 0.68 for the classification of participants without (n = 90) and with (n = 132) neuropathy (defined by the Toronto criteria).\nThese results demonstrated that our deep learning algorithm provides rapid and excellent localisation performance for the quantification of corneal nerve biomarkers. This model has potential for adoption into clinical screening programmes for diabetic neuropathy.\nThe publicly shared cornea nerve dataset (dataset 1) is available at http://bioimlab.dei.unipd.it/Corneal%20Nerve%20Tortuosity%20Data%20Set.htm and http://bioimlab.dei.unipd.it/Corneal%20Nerve%20Data%20Set.htm.", "We investigate which of the higher cognitive abilities or types of intelligence characteristic of humans are found, even in preliminary form, in non-human animals, predominantly primates, or whether qualitatively different (\"unique\") human abilities exist. This concerns (1) tool use and fabrication, (2) problem solving, (3) gaze following, (4) mirror self-recognition, (5) imitation, (6) metacognition, (7) theory of mind, (8) consciousness, (9) prosociality, and (10) language. We found that none of these abilities can be regarded as unique to humans without precursors in non-human primates. The observed differences in cognitive functions, underlying brain mechanisms and resulting behaviors correlate best with differences in the information processing capacity as an equivalent of general intelligence based on the number of cortical neurons, packing density and axonal conduction velocity plus long-range cortical fascicles. The biggest quantitative change appears to concern the origin of syntactical language, but this was preceded by an increased mental ability to manipulate sequential events within working memory.", "Bibliometric analysis shows that neuroendoscopy (NE) overcame its pioneering phase in the late 1980s, and became a significant technological and clinical innovation in the early 1990s. During those years the charge-coupled device digital video cameras were introduced and videoendoscopy had its decisive breakthrough, laying the foundation for NE take-off. NE can be considered an early product of artificial intelligence, as much as neuroimaging and neuronavigation. In Italy, cerebral NE started in 1993 and, despite a couple of years of relative delay, gained ground rapidly thanks also to the personal contribution of Michelangelo Gangemi (1949-2017), to whose memory this article is dedicated. In this paper we try to re-create the history of Italian NE through original documents and other testimonials, in the context of the general worldwide development of NE. The modality of its rapid diffusion throughout our peninsula seems a good paradigm of how cooperation without unnecessary competition can be rewarding and constructive.", "Data-driven science and its corollaries in machine learning and the wider field of artificial intelligence have the potential to drive important changes in medicine. However, medicine is not a science like any other: It is deeply and tightly bound with a large and wide network of legal, ethical, regulatory, economical, and societal dependencies. As a consequence, the scientific and technological progresses in handling information and its further processing and cross-linking for decision support and predictive systems must be accompanied by parallel changes in the global environment, with numerous stakeholders, including citizen and society. What can be seen at the first glance as a barrier and a mechanism slowing down the progression of data science must, however, be considered an important asset. Only global adoption can transform the potential of big data and artificial intelligence into an effective breakthroughs in handling health and medicine. This requires science and society, scientists and citizens, to progress together.", "Developing whole-brain emulation (WBE) technology would provide immense benefits across neuroscience, biomedicine, artificial intelligence, and robotics. At this time, constructing a simulated human brain lacks feasibility due to limited experimental data and limited computational resources. However, I suggest that progress toward this goal might be accelerated by working toward an intermediate objective, namely insect brain emulation (IBE). More specifically, this would entail creating biologically realistic simulations of entire insect nervous systems along with more approximate simulations of non-neuronal insect physiology to make \"virtual insects.\" I argue that this could be realistically achievable within the next 20\u00a0years. I propose that developing emulations of insect brains will galvanize the global community of scientists, businesspeople, and policymakers toward pursuing the loftier goal of emulating the human brain. By demonstrating that WBE is possible via IBE, simulating mammalian brains and eventually the human brain may no longer be viewed as too radically ambitious to deserve substantial funding and resources. Furthermore, IBE will facilitate dramatic advances in cognitive neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and robotics through studies performed using virtual insects.", "Intelligence at either the material or metamaterial level is a goal that researchers have been pursuing. From passive to active, metasurfaces have been developed to be programmable to dynamically and arbitrarily manipulate electromagnetic (EM) wavefields. However, the programmable metasurfaces require manual control to switch among different functionalities. Here, we put forth a smart metasurface that has self-adaptively reprogrammable functionalities without human participation. The smart metasurface is capable of sensing ambient environments by integrating an additional sensor(s) and can adaptively adjust its EM operational functionality through an unmanned sensing feedback system. As an illustrative example, we experimentally develop a motion-sensitive smart metasurface integrated with a three-axis gyroscope, which can adjust self-adaptively the EM radiation beams via different rotations of the metasurface. We develop an online feedback algorithm as the control software to make the smart metasurface achieve single-beam and multibeam steering and other dynamic reactions adaptively. The proposed metasurface is extendable to other physical sensors to detect the humidity, temperature, illuminating light, and so on. Our strategy will open up a new avenue for future unmanned devices that are consistent with the ambient environment.", "To document the auditory processing, visual attention, digit memory, phonological processing, and receptive language abilities of individual children with identified word reading difficulties.\nTwenty-five children with word reading difficulties and 28 control children with good word reading skills participated. All children were aged between 8 and 11 years, with normal hearing sensitivity and typical non-verbal intelligence. Both groups of children completed a test battery designed to assess their auditory processing, visual attention, digit memory, phonological processing, and receptive language.\nWhen compared to children who were good readers, children with word reading difficulties obtained significantly lower average scores on tests of auditory processing, including the frequency pattern test, gaps in noise, frequency discrimination, Dichotic Digit difference Test, and Listening in Spatialized Noise. The two groups did not differ on the discrimination measures of sinusoidal amplitude modulation or iterated rippled noise. The results from children with word reading difficulties showed that 5 children (20%) had comorbid deficits in auditory processing, visual attention, and backward digit memory; whereas 12 children (48%) had comorbid auditory processing and visual attention deficits only, and 2 children (8%) had comorbid deficits in auditory processing and digit memory; the remaining children had only auditory processing, visual attention, or digit memory deficits.\nThe current study highlights the general co-existence of auditory processing, memory, and visual attention deficits in children with word reading difficulties. It is also noteworthy, however, that only one fifth of the current cohort had deficits across all measured tasks. Hence, our results also show the significant individual variability inherent in children with word reading difficulties.", "The social and ecological changes accompanying the Anthropocene require changes in how pandemics are anticipated, conceived, and managed. Pandemics need to be reframed from infections we can predict to inevitable infectious and non-communicable surprises with which we need to cope. A hazard-by-hazard approach to planning and response is insufficient when the next pandemic cannot be predicted. Decision-making will benefit from scoping the problem broadly to generate deeper insights into potential threats. The origins of pandemics come from our relationships with the world around us. Health leaders, therefore, need to be aware of primordial determinants of risk arising from these changing relationships. Cross-sectoral co-learning to anticipate surprise will require bridging agents embedded within a health agency to facilitate transdisciplinary intelligence gathering. A unified set of guidelines is needed to promote pandemic resilience by collaboratively tending to the determinants of health for each other, our communities, and the natural environment.", "PCDH19 has become the second most relevant gene in epilepsy after SCN1A. Seizures often provoked by fever.\nWe screened 152 children with fever-sensitive epilepsy for gene detection. Their clinical information was followed up.\nWe found eight PCDH19 point mutations (four novel and four reported) and one whole gene deletion in 10 female probands (seven sporadic cases and three family cases) who also had cluster seizures. The common clinical features of 16 patients in 10 families included fever-sensitive and cluster seizures, mainly focal or tonic-clonic seizures, and absence of status epilepticus, normal intelligence, or mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment, the onset age ranges from 5\u00a0months to 20\u00a0years. Only four patients had multiple or focal transient discharges in interictal EEG. Focal seizures originating in the frontal region were recorded in four patients, two from the parietal region, and one from the occipital region.\nPCDH19 mutation can be inherited or de novo. The clinical spectrum of PCDH19 mutation includes PCDH19 Girls Clustering Epilepsy with or without mental retardation, psychosis, and asymptomatic male. The onset age of PCDH19 Girls Clustering Epilepsy can range from infancy to adulthood. Sisters in the same family may be sensitive to the same antiepileptic drugs. And our report expands the mutation spectrum of PCDH19 Girls Clustering Epilepsy.", "1: \u200aESGE suggests that high definition endoscopy, and dye or virtual chromoendoscopy, as well as add-on devices, can be used in average risk patients to increase the endoscopist's adenoma detection rate. However, their routine use must be balanced against costs and practical considerations.Weak recommendation, high quality evidence. 2: \u200aESGE recommends the routine use of high definition systems in individuals with Lynch syndrome.Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 3: \u200aESGE recommends the routine use, with targeted biopsies, of dye-based pancolonic chromoendoscopy or virtual chromoendoscopy for neoplasia surveillance in patients with long-standing colitis.Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: \u200aESGE suggests that virtual chromoendoscopy and dye-based chromoendoscopy can be used, under strictly controlled conditions, for real-time optical diagnosis of diminutive (\u2264\u200a5\u200amm) colorectal polyps and can replace histopathological diagnosis. The optical diagnosis has to be reported using validated scales, must be adequately photodocumented, and can be performed only by experienced endoscopists who are adequately trained, as defined in the ESGE curriculum, and audited.Weak recommendation, high quality evidence. 5: \u200aESGE recommends the use of high definition white-light endoscopy in combination with (virtual) chromoendoscopy to predict the presence and depth of any submucosal invasion in nonpedunculated colorectal polyps prior to any treatment. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 6: \u200aESGE recommends the use of virtual or dye-based chromoendoscopy in addition to white-light endoscopy for the detection of residual neoplasia at a piecemeal polypectomy scar site. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 7: \u200aESGE suggests the possible incorporation of computer-aided diagnosis (detection and characterization of lesions) to colonoscopy, if acceptable and reproducible accuracy for colorectal neoplasia is demonstrated in high quality multicenter in vivo clinical studies. Possible significant risks with implementation, specifically endoscopist deskilling and over-reliance on artificial intelligence, unrepresentative training datasets, and hacking, need to be considered. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence.", "The dissemination of misinformation in health care and the sciences has become a growing concern over the last five years. Whether the false information is spread with malice or merely ignorance, researchers, providers, librarians, regulatory bodies, and internet platform providers have all begun taking steps to identify false information and halt its proliferation online. Some companies have begun looking at ways to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning to timely and widespread identification efforts. This column will investigate what technologies are currently being considered for addressing the misinformation crisis, discuss concerns over the application of such technologies, and consider methods for libraries to become more involved with the technological side of the issue.", "Multisystem iron poisoning is a major concern for long-term beta-thalassemia management. Quantitative MRI-based techniques routinely show iron overload in heart, liver, endocrine glands and kidneys. However, data on the brain are conflicting and monitoring of brain iron content is still matter of debate.\nThis 3T-MRI study applied a well validated high-resolution whole-brain quantitative MRI assessment of iron content on 47 transfusion-dependent (mean-age: 36.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.3 years, 63% females), 23 non-transfusion dependent (mean-age: 29.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.7 years, 56% females) and 57 healthy controls (mean-age: 33.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.8 years, 65% females). Clinical data, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale scores and treatment regimens were recorded. Beside whole-brain R2* analyses, regional R2*-values were extracted in putamen, globus pallidum, caudate nucleus, thalamus and red nucleus; hippocampal volumes were also determined.\nRegional analyses yielded no significant differences between patients and controls, except in those treated with deferiprone that showed lower R2*-values (p<0.05). Whole-brain analyses of R2*-maps revealed strong age-R2* correlations (r2=0.51) in both groups and clusters of significantly increased R2*-values in beta-thalassemia patients in the hippocampal formations and around the Luschka foramina; transfusion treatment was associated with additional R2* increase in dorsal thalami. Hippocampal formation R2*-values did not correlate with hippocampal volume; hippocampal volume did not differ between patients and controls. All regions with increased R2*-values shared a strict anatomical contiguity with choroid plexuses suggesting a blooming effect as the likely cause of R2* increase, in agreement with the available histopathologic literature evidence.\nAccording to our MRI findings and the available histopathologic literature evidence, concerns about neural tissue iron overload in beta-thalassemia appear to be unjustified.", "Objective: We investigated whether levels of current physical activity (PA) contribute to the established relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and cognition in schizophrenia and whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or its precursor proBDNF mediates this relationship. Method: Sixty-one outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders participated. Neurocognition was assessed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and nine subtests from the MATRICS battery comprising a neurocognitive composite score (NCS). CRF was assessed with peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) measured directly during a maximum exercise test. Current PA levels were objectively assessed by an accelerometer worn for four consecutive days. BDNF and proBDNF were measured in fasting blood. Four serial parallel mediation analyses and two additional parallel mediation analyses were conducted, while controlling for age and sex at all levels. Results: No direct effects were found between PA measures and WAIS or NCS. No significant mediating effects of CRF or BDNF/proBDNF were detected. Conclusion: The results do not support the hypothesis that PA contributes to the naturally occurring relationship between CRF and cognition in schizophrenia or the hypothesis that BDNF or proBDNF mediates this relationship. The results arguably support the assumption that the association between CRF and cognition in schizophrenia is established developmentally early. Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02205684.", "Neurological illness can produce a disorganization of behavior, including verbal disinhibition, despite apparent preserved intelligence. Neuropsychological tests of such behavioral control mechanisms may predict real-world performance of healthy people, such as success or misbehavior in educational contexts.\nIn two separate studies, we examined how the Hayling Test of verbal response suppression predicts grades and classroom misbehavior.\nVerbal suppression errors and spontaneous strategy use were significant predictors of undergraduate grades. Using a modified version of the Hayling Test designed to reduce strategic responding with high school students (mean age 16), higher grades were predicted by shorter response suppression latencies and better working memory scores, and classroom misbehavior was predicted by lower working memory scores.\nVerbal response suppression and spontaneous strategy use, both closely linked to disorganized behavior in neuropsychological patients, predict academic achievement but seem unrelated to classroom misbehavior, which is associated with weakness in working memory.", "Neurocritical care combines the complexity of both medical and surgical disease states with the inherent limitations of assessing patients with neurologic injury. Artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered interest in the basic management of these complicated patients as data collection becomes increasingly automated.\nIn this opinion article, we highlight the potential AI has in aiding the clinician in several aspects of neurocritical care, particularly in monitoring and managing intracranial pressure, seizures, hemodynamics, and ventilation. The model-based method and data-driven method are currently the two major AI methods for analyzing critical care data. Both are able to analyze the vast quantities of patient data that are accumulated in the neurocritical care unit. AI has the potential to reduce healthcare costs, minimize delays in patient management, and reduce medical errors. However, these systems are an aid to, not a replacement for, the clinician's judgment.", "Digital pathology, including image analysis and automatic diagnosis of pathological tissue, has been developed remarkably. HALO is an image analysis platform specialized for the study of pathological tissues, which enables tissue segmentation by using artificial intelligence. In this study, we used HALO to quantify various histopathological changes and findings that were difficult to analyze using conventional image processing software. Using the tissue classifier module, the morphological features of degeneration/necrosis of the hepatocytes and muscle fibers, bile duct in the liver, basophilic tubules and hyaline casts in the kidney, cortex in the thymus, and red pulp, white pulp, and marginal zone in the spleen were learned and separated, and areas of interest were quantified. Furthermore, using the cytonuclear module and vacuole module in combination with the tissue classifier module, the number of erythroblasts in the red pulp of the spleen and each area of acinar cells in the parotid gland were quantified. The results of quantitative analysis were correlated with the histopathological grades evaluated by pathologists. By using artificial intelligence and other functions of HALO, we recognized morphological features, analyzed histopathological changes, and quantified the histopathological grades of various findings. The analysis of histopathological changes using HALO is expected to support pathology evaluations.", "Medical artificial intelligence systems are dependent on well characterized large-scale datasets. Recently released public datasets have been of great interest to the field, but pose specific challenges due to the disconnect they cause between data generation and data usage, potentially limiting the utility of these datasets.\nWe visually explore two large public datasets, to determine how accurate the provided labels are and whether other subtle problems exist. The ChestXray14 dataset contains 112,120 frontal chest films, and the Musculoskeletal Radiology (MURA) dataset contains 40,561 upper limb radiographs. A subset of around 700 images from both datasets was reviewed by a board-certified radiologist, and the quality of the original labels was determined.\nThe ChestXray14 labels did not accurately reflect the visual content of the images, with positive predictive values mostly between 10% and 30% lower than the values presented in the original documentation. There were other significant problems, with examples of hidden stratification and label disambiguation failure. The MURA labels were more accurate, but the original normal/abnormal labels were inaccurate for the subset of cases with degenerative joint disease, with a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 82%.\nVisual inspection of images is a necessary component of understanding large image datasets. We recommend that teams producing public datasets should perform this important quality control procedure and include a thorough description of their findings, along with an explanation of the data generating procedures and labeling rules, in the documentation for their datasets.", "Currently, attachment quality and attachment disorder exist in parallel, but the mutual association is still insufficiently clarified. For policy makers and clinical experts, it can be difficult to differentiate between these constructs, but the distinction is crucial to develop mental-health services and effective treatment concepts. We aimed to investigate the association between attachment representations (AR) and attachment disorders (AD), including Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED) in children aged between 5 and 9.\nA total of 135 children aged between 5 and 9 years (M=7.17 years, SD=1.40, 63% male) and their primary caregivers participated in the study. Children were interviewed with the story stem method to assess AR, and the primary caregiver completed diagnostic interviews and questionnaires on mental disorders, AD, emotional and behavioral problems, and intelligence and development.\nThe prevalence of AR in children with AD was 28.6% for the 'secure' form of AR, 17.1% for the 'insecure-avoidant' form, 25.7% for the 'insecure-ambivalent' form, and 28.6% for the 'disorganized' form. Prevalences of the various AR forms did not differ statistically significantly, indicating that AR is conceptionally distinct from AD. Children with disorganized attachment scored significantly lower on language and intelligence skills than children with secure attachment. AD was significantly associated with a higher number of comorbidities, emotional and behavioral problems, and lower language skills.\nLongitudinal studies using standardized assessment instruments are needed to systematically provide comparable and reliable empirical findings to improve current understanding of AR and AD as well as their etiological models.", "Research into the neural underpinning of intelligence has mainly adopted a construct perspective: trying to find structural and functional brain characteristics that would accommodate the psychological concept of g. Few attempts have been made to explain intelligence exclusively based on brain characteristics - the brain perspective. From a methodological viewpoint the brain intelligence relation has been studied by means of correlational and interventional studies. The later providing a causal elucidation of the brain - intelligence relation. The best neuro-anatomical predictor of intelligence is brain volume showing a modest positive correlation with g, explaining between 9 to 16% of variance. The most likely explanation was that larger brains, containing more neurons, have a greater computational power and in that way allow more complex cognitive processing. Correlations with brain surface, thickness, convolution and callosal shape showed less consistent patterns. The development of diffusion tensor imaging has allowed researchers to look also into the microstructure of brain tissue. Consistently observed was a positively correlation between white matter integrity and intelligence, supporting the idea that efficient information transfer between hemispheres and brain areas is crucial for higher intellectual competence. Based on functional studies of the brain intelligence relationship three theories have been put forward: the neural efficiency, the P-FIT and the multi demand (MD) system theory. On the other hand, The Network Neuroscience Theory of g, based on methods from mathematics, physics, and computer science, is an example for the brain perspective on neurobiological underpinning of intelligence. In this framework network flexibility and dynamics provide the foundation for general intelligence. With respect to intervention studies the most promising results have been achieved with noninvasive brain stimulation and behavioral training providing tentative support for findings put forward by the correlational approach. To date the best consensus based on the diversity of results reported would be that g is predominantly determined by lateral prefrontal attentional control of structured sensory episodes in posterior brain areas. The capacity of flexible transitions between these network states represents the essence of intelligence - g.", "To differentiate pleomorphic adenoma (PA) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is often challenging to cytologists.\nIn the present study, we tried to make an artificial neural network (ANN) model from the FNAC smears to differentiate PA from ACC.\nThe detailed cytomorphological features were analysed on the FNAC of histopathology proven cases of PA (n = 35) and ACC (n = 33) and enumerated semi-quantitatively by two independent observers. These data were used to make an ANN model to distinguish PA from ACC on FNAC material. We used neuro-intelligence software to build the ANN model. The network architecture was 10-2-1. The heuristic search engine was applied to have this model. We used backpropagation neural network to teach ANN. At least 500 iterations were done to train the model. The efficacy of this ANN model was assessed with the help of the confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curve.\nThe data were separated automatically by the software as a training set (n = 48), validation set (n = 10) and test set (n = 10). The ANN model was able to differentiate every case (10/10) of PA and ACC in the final test set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 1.\nThe currently built ANN model is competent to identify PA and ACC cases on FNAC. Additional parameters and new cases can be incorporated into this open-ended ANN model to make it more robust.", "In an Internet of Things (IoT) system, it is essential that the data measured from the sensors are accurate so that the produced results are meaningful. For example, in AgriTalk, a smart farm platform for soil cultivation with a large number of sensors, the produced sensor data are used in several Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to provide precise farming for soil microbiome and fertility, disease regulation, irrigation regulation, and pest regulation. It is important that the sensor data are correctly used in AI modeling. Unfortunately, no sensor is perfect. Even for the sensors manufactured from the same factory, they may yield different readings. This paper proposes a solution called SensorTalk to automatically detect potential sensor failures and calibrate the aging sensors semi-automatically. Numerical examples are given to show the calibration tables for temperature and humidity sensors. When the sensors control the actuators, the SensorTalk solution can also detect whether a failure occurs within a detection delay. Both analytic and simulation models are proposed to appropriately select the detection delay so that, when a potential failure occurs, it is detected reasonably early without incurring too many false alarms. Specifically, our selection can limit the false detection probability to be less than 0.7%.", "In recent months two major fields of interest in pulmonary imaging have stood out: pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary nodules. New guidelines have been released to define pulmonary fibrosis and subsequent studies have proved the value of these changes. In addition, new recommendations for classification of pulmonary nodules have been released. Radiological images are of major interest for automated and standardized analysis and so in both cases software tools using artificial intelligence were developed for visualization and quantification of the disease. These tools have been validated by human readers and demonstrated their capabilities. This review summarizes the new recommendations for classification of pulmonary fibrosis and nodules and reviews the capabilities of radiomics within these two entities.", "Clinical evaluation of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases through images is a challenge for the beginner rheumatologist since image diagnosis is an expert task with a long learning curve. The aim of this work was to present a narrative review on the main ultrasound computer-aided diagnosis systems that may help clinicians thanks to the progress made in the application of artificial intelligence techniques. We performed a literature review searching for original articles in seven repositories, from 1970 to 2019, and identified 11 main methods currently used in ultrasound computer-aided diagnosis systems. Also, we found that rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies are the four musculoskeletal and rheumatic diseases most studied that use these innovative systems, with an overall accuracy of >\u200975%.", "The patients' view on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology is still mainly unexplored territory. The aim of this article is to develop and validate a standardized patient questionnaire on the implementation of AI in radiology.\nSix domains derived from a previous qualitative study were used to develop a questionnaire, and cognitive interviews were used as pretest method. One hundred fifty-five patients scheduled for CT, MRI, and/or conventional radiography filled out the questionnaire. To find underlying latent variables, we used exploratory factor analysis with principal axis factoring and oblique promax rotation. Internal consistency of the factors was measured with Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability.\nThe exploratory factor analysis revealed five factors on AI in radiology: (1) distrust and accountability (overall, patients were moderately negative on this subject), (2) procedural knowledge (patients generally indicated the need for their active engagement), (3) personal interaction (overall, patients preferred personal interaction), (4) efficiency (overall, patients were ambiguous on this subject), and (5) being informed (overall, scores on these items were not outspoken within this factor). Internal consistency was good for three factors (1, 2, and 3), and acceptable for two (4 and 5).\nThis study yielded a viable questionnaire to measure acceptance among patients of the implementation of AI in radiology. Additional data collection with confirmatory factor analysis may provide further refinement of the scale.\n\u2022 Although AI systems are increasingly developed, not much is known about patients' views on AI in radiology. \u2022 Since it is important that newly developed questionnaires are adequately tested and validated, we did so for a questionnaire measuring patients' views on AI in radiology, revealing five factors. \u2022 Successful implementation of AI in radiology requires assessment of social factors such as subjective norms towards the technology.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) technology holds both great promise to transform mental healthcare and potential pitfalls. This article provides an overview of AI and current applications in healthcare, a review of recent original research on AI specific to mental health, and a discussion of how AI can supplement clinical practice while considering its current limitations, areas needing additional research, and ethical implications regarding AI technology.\nWe reviewed 28 studies of AI and mental health that used electronic health records (EHRs), mood rating scales, brain imaging data, novel monitoring systems (e.g., smartphone, video), and social media platforms to predict, classify, or subgroup mental health illnesses including depression, schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, and suicide ideation and attempts. Collectively, these studies revealed high accuracies and provided excellent examples of AI's potential in mental healthcare, but most should be considered early proof-of-concept works demonstrating the potential of using machine learning (ML) algorithms to address mental health questions, and which types of algorithms yield the best performance. As AI techniques continue to be refined and improved, it will be possible to help mental health practitioners re-define mental illnesses more objectively than currently done in the DSM-5, identify these illnesses at an earlier or prodromal stage when interventions may be more effective, and personalize treatments based on an individual's unique characteristics. However, caution is necessary in order to avoid over-interpreting preliminary results, and more work is required to bridge the gap between AI in mental health research and clinical care.", "Mental disorders are highly prevalent and often remain untreated. Many limitations of conventional face-to-face psychological interventions could potentially be overcome through Internet-based and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). This chapter introduces core features of IMIs, describes areas of application, presents evidence on the efficacy of IMIs as well as potential effect mechanisms, and delineates how Artificial Intelligence combined with IMIs may improve current practices in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders in adults. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials clearly show that therapist-guided IMIs can be highly effective for a broad range of mental health problems. Whether the effects of unguided IMIs are also clinically relevant, particularly under routine care conditions, is less clear. First studies on IMIs for the prevention of mental disorders have shown promising results. Despite limitations and challenges, IMIs are increasingly implemented into routine care worldwide. IMIs are also well suited for applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which provides ample opportunities to improve the identification and treatment of mental disorders. Together with methodological innovations, these approaches may also deepen our understanding of how psychological interventions work, and why. Ethical and professional restraints as well as potential contraindications of IMIs, however, should also be considered. In sum, IMIs have a high potential for improving the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders across various indications, settings, and populations. Therefore, implementing IMIs into routine care as both adjunct and alternative to face-to-face treatment is highly desirable. Technological advancements may further enhance the variability and flexibility of IMIs, and thus even further increase their impact in people's lives in the future.", "As in other areas, military surgery is being transformed by developments in artificial intelligence, robotics and digitalization. Although the prospect of operating with a\u00a0robot-assisted surgery system in the country of deployment while the responsible surgeon is in Germany is still a\u00a0long way off, the training of military surgeons and the treatment of injured soldiers on deployment would nowadays be unimaginable without the digitalization of surgery in the armed forces. The structure of the medical environment in German clinics places restrictions on training that is close to operational reality. In the daily routine it is not possible to carry out the necessary numbers of deployment-relevant emergency surgical procedures under the expected conditions. Such procedures thus require the use of appropriate simulators or simulated scenarios that are as close to reality as possible. Although military surgeons are qualified in at least two specialist areas, the availability of telemedicine on deployment is helping to noticeably improve the treatment of injured soldiers. Telemedical consultation with colleagues in Germany makes it possible, for example, to reach joint decisions across different branches and disciplines.\nUntil now it has not been possible to substitute the attending surgeon in the country of deployment with robot-assisted surgery systems or even robots for carrying out life-saving and stabilizing procedures; however, in order to provide surgeons with the necessary tools to successfully operate in situations where there is a\u00a0shortage of personnel and materials in an inhospitable environment, use is made of the means that are currently available in the German medical services and constant efforts are made to explore the future possibilities of digital simulation. This article shows the reader the current status of digitalization in surgical training and deployments in the German armed forces.", "Glaucoma presents considerable challenges in providing clinically and cost-effective care pathways. While UK population screening is not seen as justifiable, arrangements for case finding have historically been considered relatively ineffective. Detection challenges include an undetected disease burden, whether from populations failing to access services or difficulties in delivering effective case-finding strategies, and a high false positive rate from referrals via traditional case finding pathways. The enhanced General Ophthalmic Service (GOS) in Scotland and locally commissioned glaucoma referral filtering services (GRFS) elsewhere have undoubtedly reduced false positive referrals, and there is emerging evidence of effectiveness of these pathways. At the same time, it is recognised that implementing GRFS does not intrinsically reduce the burden of undetected glaucoma and late presentation, and obvious challenges remain. In terms of diagnosis and monitoring, considerable growth in capacity remains essential, and non-medical health care professional (HCP) co-management and virtual clinics continue to be important solutions in offering requisite capacity. National guidelines, commissioning recommendations, and the Common Clinical Competency Framework have clarified requirements for such services, including recommendations on training and accreditation of HCPs. At the same time, the nature of consultant-delivered care and expectations on the glaucoma specialist's role has evolved alongside these developments. Despite progress in recent decades, given projected capacity requirements, further care pathways innovations appear mandated. While the timeline for implementing potential artificial intelligence innovations in streamlining care pathways is far from established, the glaucoma burden presents an expectation that such developments will need to be at the vanguard of future developments.\n\u6458\u8981: \u9752\u5149\u773c\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u62a4\u7406\u9014\u5f84\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u867d\u7136\u82f1\u56fd\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u7b5b\u67e5\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684, \u4f46\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a, \u4e2a\u4f53\u8bca\u65ad\u4e5f\u4e00\u76f4\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u76f8\u5bf9\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u5305\u62ec\u4e86\u672a\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u8d1f\u62c5, \u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u7b5b\u67e5\u8fd8\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b\u53d1\u73b0\u7b56\u7565, \u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8f6c\u8bca\u9014\u5f84\u6240\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u9ad8\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u3002\u4e0d\u65ad\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u82cf\u683c\u5170\u666e\u901a\u773c\u79d1\u670d\u52a1 (GOS) \u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u65b9\u59d4\u6258\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u8f6c\u8bca\u8fc7\u6ee4\u670d\u52a1 (GRFS) \u65e0\u7591\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5047\u9633\u6027\u8f6c\u8bca\u7387, \u800c\u4e14\u65b0\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9014\u5f84\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u3002\u540c\u65f6, \u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u5b9e\u65bdGRFS\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ece\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u51cf\u8f7b\u672a\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u548c\u665a\u671f\u9752\u5149\u773c\u7684\u8d1f\u62c5, \u800c\u4e14\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762, \u76d1\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u957f\u4ecd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981, \u975e\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458 (HCP) \u8054\u5408\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u865a\u62df\u8bca\u6240\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fc5\u8981\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\u3002\u56fd\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u3001\u59d4\u6258\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u5171\u540c\u4e34\u5e8a\u80fd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u8981\u6c42, \u5305\u62ec\u5bf9HCP\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002\u540c\u65f6, \u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u54a8\u8be2\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5176\u671f\u5f85\u7684\u627f\u62c5\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4e5f\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u5c55\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd1\u51e0\u5341\u5e74\u6765\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55, \u4f46\u8003\u8651\u5230\u9884\u671f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u9700\u6c42, \u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u62a4\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u521b\u65b0\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5df2\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u9752\u5149\u773c\u7684\u62a4\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u65bd\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd8\u8fdc\u672a\u786e\u5b9a, \u4f46\u5bf9\u9752\u5149\u773c\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u8d1f\u62c5\u4e5f\u9884\u793a\u7740\u5b83\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5148\u950b.", "Executive function (EF) and theory of mind (ToM) are key cognitive skills for socio-emotional adjustment. Executive function develops considerably between 3 and 7 years of age, and fosters the development of social cognition skills such as ToM. Studies with adults have shown a link between EF and prejudice, as well as between empathy and prejudice. Moreover, the relationship between EF, cognitive and affective ToM and prejudice has barely been studied in children. In this study, we aimed at examining the relationship between individual differences in EF, cognitive and affective ToM and prejudice toward the Romany ethnic minority. We expected a positive association between EF and ToM skills, and a negative association between EF and prejudice. We also predicted a negative association between ToM and prejudice. A total of 86 preschool (5-6 years old, N = 43) and third-grade (8-9 years old, N = 43) children participated in the study. Results showed a negative relationship between EF and prejudice, as well as between affective ToM and prejudice, after controlling for intelligence. Moreover, we found that EF significantly predicted prejudice. Exploratory correlational analyses suggested age-related differences in the EF skills underlying prejudice regulation. These findings suggest a distinctive contribution of cognitive and affective components of ToM to prejudice, and highlight the central role of EF in social behavior regulation.", "In the past ten years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedicine has increased rapidly, which roots in the rapid growth of biomedicine data, the improvement of computing performance, and the development of deep learning methods. At present, there are great difficulties in front of AI for solving complex and comprehensive medical problems. Ontology can play an important role in how to make machines have stronger intelligence and has wider applications in the medical field. By using ontologies, (meta) data can be standardized so that data quality is improved and more data analysis methods can be introduced, data integration can be supported by the semantics relationships which are specified in ontologies, and effective logic expression in nature language can be better understood by machine. This can be a pathway to stronger AI. Under this circumstance, the Chinese Conference on Biomedical Ontology and Terminology was held in Beijing in autumn 2019, with the theme \"Making Machine Understand Data\". The success of this conference further improves the development of ontology in the field of biomedical information in China, and will promote the integration of Chinese ontology research and application with the international standards and the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability(FAIR) Data Principle.", "Short forms of IQ (S-IQ) assessments are time efficient and highly predictive of the full IQ (F-IQ) in healthy individuals. To investigate the validity of S-IQs for patients with neurodevelopmental impairments, this study tested a well-established S-IQ version in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD).\nThe Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition was applied in 107 children with complex CHD aged 9-11 years. F-IQ and a well-established S-IQ version were calculated for each patient. The agreement between S-IQ and F-IQ was investigated across the whole spectrum of IQ scores. Finally, we tested a method to adjust IQs to resolve potential bias and validated this method in an independent sample of 55 CHD patients.\nS-IQ and F-IQ correlated strongly. Nevertheless, the size of the bias correlated with the true IQ, indicating larger error at the tails of the distribution. Estimating a corrected IQ by adjusting the S-IQ with correction parameters substantially improved agreement.\nWe here report that substantial bias may underestimate low IQ scores and overestimate high ones. This bias should be considered when at-risk populations are assessed with S-IQs. Importantly, the bias can be minimized by using a correction formula.", "Although much effort is focused on improving the technical performance of artificial intelligence, there are compelling reasons to focus more on the implementation of this technology class to solve real-world applications. In this \"last mile\" of implementation lie many complex challenges that may make technically high-performing systems perform poorly. Instead of viewing artificial intelligence development as a linear one of algorithm development through to eventual deployment, there are strong reasons to take a more agile approach, iteratively developing and testing artificial intelligence within the context in which it finally will be used.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is heralded as the most disruptive technology to health services in the 21st century. Many commentary articles published in the general public and health domains recognise that medical imaging is at the forefront of these changes due to our large digital data footprint. Radiomics is transforming medical images into mineable high-dimensional data to optimise clinical decision-making; however, some would argue that AI could infiltrate workplaces with very few ethical checks and balances. In this commentary article, we describe how AI is beginning to change medical imaging services and the innovations that are on the horizon. We explore how AI and its various forms, including machine learning, will challenge the way medical imaging is delivered from workflow, image acquisition, image registration to interpretation. Diagnostic radiographers will need to learn to work alongside our 'virtual colleagues', and we argue that there are vital changes to entry and advanced curricula together with national professional capabilities to ensure machine-learning tools are used in the safest and most effective manner for our patients.", "Thyroid hormones (THs) are critical for brain development. Whether low-moderate fluoride exposure affects thyroid function and what the impact is on children's intelligence remain elusive.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the associations between low-moderate fluoride exposure and thyroid function in relation to children's intelligence.\nWe recruited 571 resident children, aged 7-13\u202fyears, randomly from endemic and non-endemic fluorosis areas in Tianjin, China. We measured fluoride concentrations in drinking water and urine using the national standardized ion selective electrode method. Thyroid function was evaluated through the measurements of basal THs [(total triiodothyronine (TT3), total thyronine (TT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyronine (FT4)] and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in serum. Multivariable linear and logistical regression models were used to assess associations among fluoride exposure, thyroid function and IQ scores.\nIn adjusted models, every 1\u202fmg/L increment of water fluoride was associated with 0.13 uIU/mL increase in TSH. Every 1\u202fmg/L increment of urinary fluoride was associated with 0.09 ug/dL decrease in TT4, 0.009\u202fng/dL decrease in FT4 and 0.11 uIU/mL increase in TSH. Fluoride exposure was inversely related to IQ scores (B\u202f=\u202f-1.587; 95% CI: -2.607, -0.568 for water fluoride and B\u202f=\u202f-1.214; 95% CI: -1.987, -0.442 for urinary fluoride). Higher TT3, FT3 were related to the increased odds of children having high normal intelligence (OR\u202f=\u202f3.407, 95% CI: 1.044, 11.120 for TT3; OR\u202f=\u202f3.277, 95% CI: 1.621, 6.623 for FT3). We detected a significant modification effect by TSH on the association between urinary fluoride and IQ scores, without mediation by THs.\nOur study suggests low-moderate fluoride exposure is associated with alterations in childhood thyroid function that may modify the association between fluoride and intelligence.", "We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the utilization of the synchronization of chaotic lasers for decision making. We perform decision making to solve the multi-armed bandit problem using lag synchronization of chaos in mutually coupled semiconductor lasers. We observe the spontaneous exchanges of the leader-laggard relationship under lag synchronization of chaos, and we find that the leader laser can be controlled by changing the coupling strengths between the two lasers. To solve the multi-armed bandit problem, we select one of the slot machines with unknown hit probabilities based only on the identity of the leader laser while reconfiguring the coupling strength to determine the correct decision. We successfully perform an on-line experimental demonstration of the decision making based on the two-laser coupled architecture. This is the first time that synchronization in chaotic lasers is utilized for decision making, and this study paves the way for novel resources for future photonic intelligence.", "Breast cancer care is a leading area for development of artificial intelligence (AI), with applications including screening and diagnosis, risk calculation, prognostication and clinical decision-support, management planning, and precision medicine. We review the ethical, legal and social implications of these developments. We consider the values encoded in algorithms, the need to evaluate outcomes, and issues of bias and transferability, data ownership, confidentiality and consent, and legal, moral and professional responsibility. We consider potential effects for patients, including on trust in healthcare, and provide some social science explanations for the apparent rush to implement AI solutions. We conclude by anticipating future directions for AI in breast cancer care. Stakeholders in healthcare AI should acknowledge that their enterprise is an ethical, legal and social challenge, not just a technical challenge. Taking these challenges seriously will require broad engagement, imposition of conditions on implementation, and pre-emptive systems of oversight to ensure that development does not run ahead of evaluation and deliberation. Once artificial intelligence becomes institutionalised, it may be difficult to reverse: a proactive role for government, regulators and professional groups will help ensure introduction in robust research contexts, and the development of a sound evidence base regarding real-world effectiveness. Detailed public discussion is required to consider what kind of AI is acceptable rather than simply accepting what is offered, thus optimising outcomes for health systems, professionals, society and those receiving care.", "Self-help and automated technologies can be useful for behavioral and mental health education and interventions. These technologies include interactive media, online courses, artificial intelligence-powered chatbots, voice assistants, and video games. Self-help media can include books, videos, audible media like podcasts, blog and print articles, and self-contained Internet sites. Social media, online courses, and mass-market mobile apps also can include such media. These technologies serve to decrease geospatial, temporal, and financial barriers. This article describes different self-help and automated technologies, how to implement such technologies in existing clinical services, and how to implement according to patient needs.", "Optical sensing that integrates communication and sensing functions is playing a more and more important role in both military and civil applications. Incorporating optical sensing and optical communication, optical sensor networks (OSNs) that undertake the task of high-speed and large-capacity applications and sensing data transmissions have become an important communication infrastructure. However, multiple failures and disasters in OSNs can cause serious sensing provisioning problems. To ensure uninterrupted sensing data transmission, survivability has always been an important research emphasis. This paper focuses on the survivable deployment of OSNs against multiple failures and disasters. We first review and evaluate the existing survivability technologies developed for or applied to OSNs, such as fiber bus protection, self-healing architecture, and 1 + 1 protection. We then elaborate on the disaster-resilient survivability requirement of OSNs. Moreover, we propose a new k-node (edge) sensing connectivity concept, which ensures the connectivity between sensing data and users. Based on k-node (edge) sensing connectivity, the disaster-resilient survivability technologies are developed. The key technologies necessary to implement k-node (edge) sensing connectivity are also elaborated. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly. It can be used to improve the survivability of OSNs. This paper details potential development directions of survivability technologies of optical sensing in OSNs employing AI.", "Previous studies suggest that tasks dependent on the mental number line may be difficult for Williams Syndrome (WS) and Down Syndrome (DS) groups. However, few have directly assessed number line estimation in these groups. The current study assessed 28 WS, 25 DS and 25 typically developing (TD) participants in non-verbal intelligence, number familiarity, visuo-spatial skills and number line estimation. Group comparisons indicated no differences in number line estimation. However, the WS group displayed difficulties with visuo-spatial skills and the DS group displayed difficulties with number familiarity. Differential relationships between number line estimation and visuo-spatial/number familiarity skills were observed across groups. Data is discussed in the context of assessment of skills in neurodevelopmental disorders.", "Proximal symphalangism is a rare disease with multiple phenotypes including reduced proximal interphalangeal joint space, symphalangism of the 4th and/or 5th finger, as well as hearing loss. At present, at least two types of proximal symphalangism have been identified in the clinic. One is proximal symphalangism-1A (SYM1A), which is caused by genetic variants in Noggin (NOG), another is proximal symphalangism-1B (SYM1B), which is resulted from Growth Differentiation Factor 5 (GDF5) mutations.\nHere, we reported a Chinese family with symphalangism of the 4th and/or 5th finger and moderate deafness. The proband was a 13-year-old girl with normal intelligence but symphalangism of the 4th finger in the left hand and moderate deafness. Hearing testing and inner ear CT scan suggested that the proband suffered from structural deafness. Family history investigation found that her father (II-3) and grandmother (I-2) also suffered from hearing loss and symphalangism. Target sequencing identified a novel heterozygous NOG mutation, c.690C\u2009>\u2009G/p.C230W, which was the genetic lesion of the affected family. Bioinformatics analysis and public databases filtering further confirmed the pathogenicity of the novel mutation. Furthermore, we assisted the family to deliver a baby girl who did not carry the mutation by genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis using amniotic fluid DNA sequencing.\nIn this study, we identified a novel NOG mutation (c.690C\u2009>\u2009G/p.C230W) by target sequencing and helped the family to deliver a baby who did not carry the mutation. Our study expanded the spectrum of NOG mutations and contributed to genetic diagnosis and counseling of families with SYM1A.", "Scene-Based Psychodramatic Family Therapy (SB-PFT) is a multiple-family intervention for adolescents with behavioural problems implemented by Child Welfare Services in Spain. This intervention is aimed at promoting adolescent well-being. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of SB-PFT in 17 trials, measuring its impact on the emotional intelligence, parental attachment, peer attachment and antisocial behaviour of 216 adolescents (109 participating in the intervention and 107 in the control group). Repeated measures ANOVAs for pretest/posttest differences and long-term growth models were estimated. In the short term, the intervention had a positive impact on emotional intelligence and had a stabilising effect on parental attachment, whereas the long-term results showed significant logarithmic growth in emotional intelligence and exponential growth in parental attachment and a decrease in antisocial behaviour. However, no changes in peer attachment were shown. This study demonstrates SB-PFT to be a potentially effective intervention for adolescents with behavioural problems and emphasises the importance of fostering emotional intelligence.", "Against the background of the results of surveys carried out previously on American, Polish, and European academics, we present new data on the perception of races among non-biological anthropologists. In five case studies, we surveyed 585 respondents belonging to the academic community (of biologists and cultural anthropologists) and ordinary people from three European countries: Poland, Czech Republic and England. All groups were concordant on the question \"Are there [biological] races in humans?\" - replying mostly in the affirmative. For the number of races that humans can be divided into, respondents' views were discordant depending on the society they live in. Regarding opinions about supposed racial characteristics, the response patterns of all groups were again much alike: The vast majority of the participants thought of human races in terms of morphological differences, but mostly did not see an association between race and intelligence, personality and religion. We suggest that the persistence of racial thinking about human diversity depends, to a large extent, on schooling and education, and certainly is a consequence of lack of academic and public discourse on race.", "In young adults, sleep is associated with important changes in cerebral connectivity during the first cycle of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Our study aimed to evaluate how electroencephalography (EEG) connectivity during sleep differs between young and older individuals, and across the sleep cycles.\nWe used imaginary coherence to estimate EEG connectivity during NREM and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in 30 young (14 women; 20-30 years) and 29 older (18 women; 50-70 years) individuals. We also explored the association between coherence and cognitive measures.\nOlder individuals showed lower EEG connectivity in stage N2 but higher connectivity in REM and stage N3 compared to the younger cohort. Age-related differences in N3 were driven by the first sleep cycle. EEG connectivity was lower in REM than N3, especially in younger individuals. Exploratory analyses, controlling for the effects of age, indicated that higher EEG connectivity in delta during N2 was associated with higher processing speed, whereas, during REM sleep, lower EEG connectivity in delta and sigma was associated with higher verbal memory performance and a higher global averaged intelligence quotient score.\nOur results indicated that age modifies sleep EEG connectivity but the direction and the magnitude of these effects differ between sleep stages and cycles. Results in N3 and REM point to a reduced ability of the older brains to disconnect as compared to the younger ones. Our results also support the notion that cerebral functional connectivity during sleep may be associated with cognitive functions.", "We begin our tripartite Essay with a triangle of understanding, theory and simulation. Sketching the intimate tie between explanation and teaching, we also point to the emotional impact of understanding. As we trace the development of theory in chemistry, Dirac's characterization of what is known and what is needed for theoretical chemistry comes up, as does the role of prediction, and Thom's phrase \"To predict is not to explain.\" We give a typology of models, and then describe, no doubt inadequately, machine learning and neural networks. In the second part, we leave philosophy, beginning by describing Roald's being beaten by simulation. This leads us to artificial intelligence (AI), Searle's Chinese room, and Strevens' account of what a go-playing program knows. Back to our terrain-we ask \"Quantum Chemistry, \u2020 ca. 2020?\" Then move to examples of AI affecting social matters, ranging from trivial to scary. We argue that moral decisions are hardly to be left to a computer. At this point, we try to pull the reader up, giving the opposing view of an optimistic, limitless future a voice. But we don't do justice to that view-how could we? We return to questioning the ascetic dimension of scientists, their romance with black boxes. Onward: In the 3rd part of this Essay, we work our way up from pessimism. We trace (another triangle!) the special interests of experimentalists, who want the theory we love, and reliable numbers as well. We detail in our own science instances where theory gave us real joy. Two more examples-on magnetic coupling in inorganic diradicals, and the way to think about alkali metal halides, show us the way to integrate simulation with theory. Back and forth is how it should be-between painfully-obtained, intriguing numbers, begging for interpretation, in turn requiring new concepts, new models, new theoretically grounded tools of computation. Through such iterations understanding is formed. As our tripartite Essay ends, we outline a future of consilience, with a role both for fact-seekers, and searchers for understanding. Chemistry's streak of creation provides in that conjoined future a passage to art and to perceiving, as we argue we must, the sacred in science.", "The integration of artificial intelligence in the radiation oncologist's workflow has multiple applications and significant potential. From the initial patient encounter, artificial intelligence may aid in pretreatment disease outcome and toxicity prediction. It may subsequently aid in treatment planning, and enhanced dose optimization. Artificial intelligence may also optimize the quality assurance process and support a higher level of safety, quality, and efficiency of care. This article describes components of the radiation consultation, planning, and treatment process and how the thoughtful integration of artificial intelligence may improve shared decision making, planning efficiency, planning quality, patient safety, and patient outcomes.", "Artificial intelligence involves a wide range of smart techniques that are applicable to medical services including nuclear medicine. Recent advances in computer power, availability of accumulated digital archives containing large amount of patient images, and records bring new opportunities for the implementation of artificial techniques in nuclear medicine. As a subset of artificial intelligence, machine learning is an emerging tool that possibly perform many clinical tasks. Nuclear medicine community needs to adapt to this fast approaching smart era, to exploit the opportunities and tackle the problems associated with artificial intelligence tools. It is aimed in this editorial to outline the potentials and challenges of artificial intelligence applications in nuclear medicine.", "A workshop on research gaps and opportunities for Precision Medicine in Pancreatic Disease was sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases on July 24, 2019, in Pittsburgh. The workshop included an overview lecture on precision medicine in cancer and 4 sessions: (1) general considerations for the application of bioinformatics and artificial intelligence; (2) omics, the combination of risk factors and biomarkers; (3) precision imaging; and (4) gaps, barriers, and needs to move from precision to personalized medicine for pancreatic disease. Current precision medicine approaches and tools were reviewed, and participants identified knowledge gaps and research needs that hinder bringing precision medicine to pancreatic diseases. Most critical were (a) multicenter efforts to collect large-scale patient data sets from multiple data streams in the context of environmental and social factors; (b) new information systems that can collect, annotate, and quantify data to inform disease mechanisms; (c) novel prospective clinical trial designs to test and improve therapies; and (d) a framework for measuring and assessing the value of proposed approaches to the health care system. With these advances, precision medicine can identify patients early in the course of their pancreatic disease and prevent progression to chronic or fatal illness.", "Fluid intelligence (gf) represents a crucial component of human cognition, as it correlates with academic achievement, successful aging, and longevity. However, it has strong resilience against enhancement interventions, making the identification of gf enhancement approaches a key unmet goal of cognitive neuroscience. Here, we applied a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)-inducing brain stimulation protocol, named cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (cc-PAS), to modulate gf in 29 healthy young subjects (13 females-mean\u2009\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation, 25.43\u00a0years\u2009\u00b1\u20093.69), based on dual-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Pairs of neuronavigated TMS pulses (10-ms interval) were delivered over two frontoparietal nodes of the gf network, based on individual functional magnetic resonance imaging data and in accordance with cognitive models of information processing across the prefrontal and parietal lobe. cc-PAS enhanced accuracy at gf tasks, with parieto-frontal and fronto-parietal stimulation significantly increasing logical and relational reasoning, respectively. Results suggest the possibility of using SPTD-inducing TMS protocols to causally validate cognitive models by selectively engaging relevant networks and manipulating inter-regional temporal dynamics supporting specific cognitive functions.", "Cognitive processes associated with frontal lobe functioning are often termed \"executive functions.\" Two such processes are initiation and inhibition or the starting and stopping of responses. It has recently been claimed dysfunction of executive abilities can be explained by a single measure of fluid intelligence. Here, we test this claim, specifically for the executive abilities of response initiation and inhibition, across the healthy lifespan.\nIn a cohort of 336 healthy adults (18-89\u00a0years), initiation and inhibition were assessed with the Hayling test, Stroop test, and phonemic and semantic verbal fluency. All participants also completed a measure of fluid intelligence. The relationship between fluid intelligence and executive measures was explored across the lifespan using a continuous approach. Mediation models were computed to assess whether age-related decline across the four initiation/inhibition tasks could be fully explained by a single measure of fluid intelligence.\nAge was negatively correlated with response initiation/inhibition and fluid intelligence. The mediation analyses identified only partial mediation of fluid intelligence for age and Hayling performance. By contrast, fluid intelligence did not mediate performance on the Stroop test or phonemic and semantic verbal fluency.\nResponse initiation/inhibition are not able to be explained by fluid intelligence. The results support a multifactorial theory of executive functions and provide evidence for the inclusion of multiple specific executive measures in a thorough neuropsychological assessment of age-related cognitive decline.", "Many real-world applications require artificial agents to compete and coordinate with other agents in complex environments. As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1-3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players. AlphaStar was rated at Grandmaster level for all three StarCraft races and above 99.8% of officially ranked human players.", "This study analyses, in children born in twin births, the relationship between reading, writing and arithmetic learning, on the one hand, and type of delivery, on the other, controlling for the effect of interaction and/or confusion of third variables (maternal age at delivery, gestational age, fetal position, birthweight, 1-min Apgar score). In the planned retrospective cohort design, the exposed cohort consisted of children born by caesarean section, and the non-exposed cohort was comprised of children born vaginally. One hundred and twenty-four children born of twin births were evaluated during their first year of primary school: K-BIT tests were used to measure intelligence; the Eval\u00faa-1 battery was used to assess reading, writing, and arithmetic ability; and the children's clinical histories were analysed for obstetric and neonatal variables. After applying binary logistic regressions for each dependent variable, it was found that caesarean delivery in twin births appeared as a possible independent risk factor for specific learning disabilities (LDs) in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Based on these results, further research using larger samples and at more advanced ages is required in order to analyse the influence of obstetric and neonatal variables on the processes underlying specific LDs.", "The objective of the present study is to analyze the influence of coaches on emotional intelligence and on levels of anxiety, motivation, self-esteem, and resilience among athletes. Five-hundred forty-seven semi-professional athletes between the ages of 16 and 19 participated in this study. Various statistical analyses were conducted which explain the causal relationships between the variables. The results, obtained using a structural equations model, find that while autonomy support positively predicts emotional intelligence, perceived control predicts it negatively. Moreover, emotional intelligence positively predicts self-esteem and self-determined motivation, but negatively predicts anxiety. Other results show that self-esteem positively predicts self-determined motivation, whereas anxiety predicts it negatively. Finally, self-determined motivation positively predicts resilience. Indeed, the study demonstrates the influence and the importance of coaches in relation to the emotional intelligence, psychological well-being, and motivational processes of adolescent athletes when the latter engage in their respective sports. These results help to better understand how different behavioral, emotional, and social aspects belonging to the athlete interrelate with one another during competition.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies develop rapidly and have myriad applications in medicine and health care. However, there is a lack of comprehensive reporting on the productivity, workflow, topics, and research landscape of AI in this field.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the global development of scientific publications and constructed interdisciplinary research topics on the theory and practice of AI in medicine from 1977 to 2018.\nWe obtained bibliographic data and abstract contents of publications published between 1977 and 2018 from the Web of Science database. A total of 27,451 eligible articles were analyzed. Research topics were classified by latent Dirichlet allocation, and principal component analysis was used to identify the construct of the research landscape.\nThe applications of AI have mainly impacted clinical settings (enhanced prognosis and diagnosis, robot-assisted surgery, and rehabilitation), data science and precision medicine (collecting individual data for precision medicine), and policy making (raising ethical and legal issues, especially regarding privacy and confidentiality of data). However, AI applications have not been commonly used in resource-poor settings due to the limit in infrastructure and human resources.\nThe application of AI in medicine has grown rapidly and focuses on three leading platforms: clinical practices, clinical material, and policies. AI might be one of the methods to narrow down the inequality in health care and medicine between developing and developed countries. Technology transfer and support from developed countries are essential measures for the advancement of AI application in health care in developing countries.", "With the recent developments in deep learning technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually been transformed from cutting-edge technology into practical applications. AI plays an important role in disease diagnosis and treatment, health management, drug research and development, and precision medicine. Interdisciplinary collaborations will be crucial to develop new AI algorithms for medical applications. In this paper, we review the basic workflow for building an AI model, identify publicly available databases of ocular fundus images, and summarize over 60 papers contributing to the field of AI development.", "Both acute and advanced heart failure are an increasing threat in term of survival, quality of life and socio-economical burdens. Paradoxically, the use of successful treatments for chronic heart failure can prolong life but-per definition-causes the rise in age of patients experiencing acute decompensations, since nothing at the moment helps avoiding an acute or final stage in the elderly population. To complicate the picture, acute heart failure syndromes are a collection of symptoms, signs and markers, with different aetiologies and different courses, also due to overlapping morbidities and to the plethora of chronic medications. The palette of cardio- and vasoactive drugs used in the hospitalization phase to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic is scarce and even scarcer is the evidence for the agents commonly used in the practice (e.g. catecholamines). The pipeline in this field is poor and the clinical development chronically unsuccessful. Recent set backs in expected clinical trials for new agents in acute heart failure (AHF) (omecamtiv, serelaxine, ularitide) left a field desolately empty, where only few drugs have been approved for clinical use, for example, levosimendan and nesiritide. In this consensus opinion paper, experts from 26 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, U.K. and Ukraine) analyse the situation in details also by help of artificial intelligence applied to bibliographic searches, try to distil some lesson-learned to avoid that future projects would make the same mistakes as in the past and recommend how to lead a successful development project in this field in dire need of new agents.", "This study examined the identification frameworks, specific models, and assessment practices used by school psychologists to identify students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) in public schools in the United States. We surveyed school psychologist practitioners using an online survey, conducted a review of state regulations addressing SLD, and evaluated the effects of state-level policies and school psychologists' characteristics on identification practices. Responses from more than 1,300 school psychologists revealed that multiple SLD identification frameworks are utilized and that state regulations generally have stronger effects on identification practices than do characteristics such as school psychologists' age, highest degree obtained, and years of experience. Frameworks with well-known psychometric limitations, such as those employing intelligence-achievement discrepancy formulas, remain commonly employed. We encourage more and better scientific research into both the conceptual and psychometric outcomes associated with SLD identification frameworks and urge application of evidence-based practices in the assessment and treatment of academic deficits.

Significant developments have occurred in the area of medical signal processing, measurement techniques, and health monitoring, such as vital biological signs for biomedical systems and noise and vibration of mechanical systems, which are carried out by instruments that generate large data sets. These big data sets, ultimately driven by high population growth, would require Artificial Intelligence techniques to analyse and model. In this Special Issue, papers are presented on the latest signal processing and deep learning techniques used for health monitoring of biomedical and mechanical systems.", "Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a risk factor for developmental problems in offspring. Despite a high prevalence of IPV in the UK and elsewhere, the longer-term outcomes of offspring born to exposed mothers remain under-researched. Methods: Population-based cohort study. We assessed IPV prevalence by type and timing for 3,153 mother-child pairs with complete data within our study population and examined associations between IPV and offspring IQ. We used multiple-imputation to evaluate bias due to our exclusion of observations with missing covariate data. Results: Nearly one in five mothers reported IPV during the study period, with 17.6% reporting emotional violence and 6.8% reporting physical violence. Taking into account potential confounders, the IQ scores of children born to mothers exposed to physical violence remained lower than those of maternally unexposed children (full-scale IQ = -2.8 points [95%CI -4.9 to -0.7], verbal IQ = -2.2 [95%CI -4.4 to -0.1], performance IQ = -2.7 [95%CI\u00a0 -5.0 to -0.5]) and odds of below-average intelligence (IQ<90) remained increased for full-scale (OR 1.48 [95%CI 1.03 to 2.14] and performance IQ (OR 1.48 [95%CI 1.08 to 2.04]) but not verbal IQ (OR 1.06 [95%CI 0.69 to 1.64]). Most physical violence occurred postnatally, and relative odds were most substantial when mothers were exposed to violence across pre-/perinatal and postnatal study periods (OR performance IQ<90 = 2.97 [95%CI 1.30 to 6.82]). Conclusions: Maternal exposure to physical IPV is associated with lower offspring IQ at age 8. Associations persisted after adjusting for potential confounders and were driven by violence occurring postnatally.", "As an important trait at birth, infant head circumference (HC) is associated with a variety of intelligence- and mental-related conditions. Despite being dominated by genetics, the mechanism underlying the variation of HC is poorly understood. Aiming to uncover the genetic basis of HC, we performed a genome-wide joint association analysis by integrating the genome-wide association summary statistics of HC with that of its two related traits, birth length and birth weight, using a recently developed integrative method, multitrait analysis of genome-wide association (MTAG), and performed in silico replication in an independent sample of intracranial volume (N = 26,577). We then conducted a series of bioinformatic investigations on the identified loci. Combining the evidence from both the MTAG analysis and the in silico replication, we identified three novel loci at the genome-wide significance level (\u03b1 = 5.0 \u00d7 10-8): 3q23 [lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9846396, p MTAG = 3.35 \u00d7 10-8, p replication = 0.01], 7p15.3 (rs12534093, p MTAG = 2.00 \u00d7 10-8, p replication = 0.004), and 9q33.3 (rs7048271 p MTAG = 9.23 \u00d7 10-10, p replication = 1.14 \u00d7 10-4). Each of the three lead SNPs was associated with at least one of eight brain-related traits including intelligence and educational attainment. Credible risk variants, defined as those SNPs located within 500 kb of the lead SNP and with p values within two orders of magnitude of the lead SNP, were enriched in DNase I hypersensitive site region in brain. Nine candidate genes were prioritized at the three novel loci using multiple sources of information. Gene set enrichment analysis identified one associated pathway GO:0048009, which participates in the development of nervous system. Our findings provide useful insights into the genetic basis of HC and the relationship between brain growth and mental health.", "The long history of the Academy of Dental Materials (ADM) is documented with its strategies (a) to rapidly communicate science among its members, (b) to establish special awards to stimulate new science, and (c) to develop new dental materials scientists.\nWe searched the history of the last 35 years of the ADM newsletters, transactions, journals, and officer notes. We document the (a) presidents, (b) meeting history, (c) membership growth, and (d) development of special awards through 2019 with the recent creation of the ADM Marshall Post-Doctoral Award.\nThere are 36 years of recent ADM history, 42 international meetings, membership growth to 400 individuals from 15 countries, service of 19 presidents, Paffenbarger annual Awardees since 1989, induction of >200 fellows, and recognition of the first winner of Marshall Post-Doctoral Award in 2018. New directions for recruiting members are suggested.

Triage scores aim to optimize the waiting time and prioritize the resource usage. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms offer advantages for creating predictive clinical applications.\nEvaluate a state-of-the-art machine learning model for predicting mortality at the triage level and, by validating this automatic tool, improve the categorization of patients in the ED.\nAn institutional review board (IRB) approval was granted for this retrospective study. Information of consecutive adult patients (ages 18-100) admitted at the emergency department (ED) of one hospital were retrieved (January 1, 2012-December 31, 2018). Features included the following: demographics, admission date, arrival mode, referral code, chief complaint, previous ED visits, previous hospitalizations, comorbidities, home medications, vital signs, and Emergency Severity Index (ESI). The following outcomes were evaluated: early mortality (up to 2\u00a0days post ED registration) and short-term mortality (2-30\u00a0days post ED registration). A gradient boosting model was trained on data from years 2012-2017 and examined on data from the final year (2018). The area under the curve (AUC) for mortality prediction was used as an outcome metric. Single-variable analysis was conducted to develop a nine-point triage score for early mortality.\nOverall, 799,522 ED visits were available for analysis. The early and short-term mortality rates were 0.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Models trained on the full set of features yielded an AUC of 0.962 for early mortality and 0.923 for short-term mortality. A model that utilized the nine features with the highest single-variable AUC scores (age, arrival mode, chief complaint, five primary vital signs, and ESI) yielded an AUC of 0.962 for early mortality.\nThe gradient boosting model shows high predictive ability for screening patients at risk of early mortality utilizing data available at the time of triage in the ED.", "Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) is a fetal condition defined as the abnormal rate of fetal growth. The pathology is a documented cause of fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In clinical practice, diagnosis is confirmed at birth and may only be suspected during pregnancy. Therefore, designing an accurate model for the early and prompt identification of pathology in the antepartum period is crucial in view of pregnancy management.\nWe tested the performance of 15 machine learning techniques in discriminating healthy versus IUGR fetuses. The various models were trained with a set of 12 physiology based heart rate features extracted from a single antepartum CardioTocographic (CTG) recording. The reason for the utilization of time, frequency, and nonlinear indices is based on their standalone documented ability to describe several physiological and pathological fetal conditions.\nWe validated our approach on a database of 60 healthy and 60 IUGR fetuses. The machine learning methodology achieving the best performance was Random Forests. Specifically, we obtained a mean classification accuracy of 0.911 [0.860, 0.961 (0.95 confidence interval)] averaged over 10 test sets (10 Fold Cross Validation). Similar results were provided by Classification Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines. A features ranking procedure highlighted that nonlinear indices showed the highest capability to discriminate between the considered fetal conditions. Nevertheless, is the combination of features investigating CTG signal in different domains, that contributes to an increase in classification accuracy.\nWe provided validation of an accurate artificially intelligence framework for the diagnosis of IUGR condition in the antepartum period. The employed physiology based heart rate features constitute an interpretable link between the machine learning results and the quantitative estimators of fetal wellbeing.", "Breast cancer imaging is always improving for the last 20\u00a0years in spite of digitalization and computer development. News tools in mammography (Digital Breast Tomosynthesis, Contrast enhanced mammography), sonography (elastography, Automated echography), MRI (Diffusion, abbreviated MRI) and Nuclear medicine has the great potential to be the future of breats imaging. But true revolution will be to use the huge volume of \"hidden\" imaging data, by Intelligence Artificial process or Biological progress (in genomics, proteiomics) to purpose to our patient a personalized imaging.", "Impaired verbal communication is a prominent feature in patients with schizophrenia. Verbal communication difficulties adversely affect psychosocial outcomes and worsen schizophrenia's clinical manifestation. In the present study, we aimed to investigate associations among gray matter (GM) volumes in language processing areas (LPAs), verbal ability, and positive symptoms in first-episode patients (FEPs) with schizophrenia spectrum psychosis.\nWe enrolled 94 FEPs and 52 healthy controls (HCs) and subjected them to structural magnetic resonance imaging. The GM volumes of the bilateral pars opercularis (POp), pars triangularis (PTr), planum temporale (PT), Heschl's gyrus (HG), insula, and fusiform gyrus (FG), were estimated and compared between the FEPs and HCs. Verbal intelligence levels and positive symptom severity were examined for correlations with the left LPA volumes.\nThe GM volumes of the left POp, HG, and FG were significantly smaller in the FEPs than in the HCs, while the right regions showed no significant between-group difference. A multiple linear regression model revealed that larger left PT volume was associated with better verbal intelligence in FEPs. In exploratory correlation analysis, several LPAs showed significant correlations with the severity of positive symptoms in FEPs. The left FG volume had a strong inverse correlation with the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations, while the left PT volume was inversely associated with the severity of positive formal thought disorder and delusions. Moreover, the volume of the left insula was positively associated with the severity of bizarre behavior.\nThe present study suggests that GM abnormalities in the LPAs, which can be detected during the early stage of illness, may underlie impaired verbal communication and positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia spectrum psychosis.", "This study was designed to evaluate the classification accuracy of a multivariate model of performance validity assessment using embedded validity indicators (EVIs) within the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV).\nArchival data were collected from 100 adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) consecutively referred for neuropsychological assessment in a clinical setting. The classification accuracy of previously published individual EVIs nested within the WAIS-IV and a composite measure based on six independent EVIs were evaluated against psychometrically defined non-credible performance.\nUnivariate validity cutoffs based on age-corrected scaled scores on Coding, Symbol Search, Digit Span, Letter-Number-Sequencing, Vocabulary minus Digit Span, and Coding minus Symbol Search were strong predictors of psychometrically defined non-credible responding. Failing \u22653 of these six EVIs at the liberal cutoff improved specificity (.91-.95) over univariate cutoffs (.78-.93). Conversely, failing \u22652 EVIs at the more conservative cutoff increased and stabilized sensitivity (.43-.67) compared to univariate cutoffs (.11-.63) while maintaining consistently high specificity (.93-.95).\nIn addition to being a widely used test of cognitive functioning, the WAIS-IV can also function as a measure of performance validity. Consistent with previous research, combining information from multiple EVIs enhanced the classification accuracy of individual cutoffs and provided more stable parameter estimates. If the current findings are replicated in larger, diagnostically and demographically heterogeneous samples, the WAIS-IV has the potential to become a powerful multivariate model of performance validity assessment.\nUsing a combination of multiple performance validity indicators embedded within the subtests of theWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the credibility of the response set can be establishedwith a high level of confidence. Multivariatemodels improve classification accuracy over individual tests. Relying on existing test data is a cost-effective approach to performance validity assessment.", "What is the place of emotion in intelligent robots? In the past two decades, researchers have advocated for the inclusion of some emotion-related components in the general information processing architecture of autonomous agents, say, for better communication with humans, or to instill a sense of urgency to action. The framework advanced here goes beyond these approaches and proposes that emotion and motivation need to be integrated with all aspects of the architecture. Thus, cognitive-emotional integration is a key design principle. Emotion is not an \"add on\" that endows a robot with \"feelings\" (for instance, reporting or expressing its internal state). It allows the significance of percepts, plans, and actions to be an integral part of all its computations. It is hypothesized that a sophisticated artificial intelligence cannot be built from separate cognitive and emotional modules. A hypothetical test inspired by the Turing test, called the Dolores test, is proposed to test this assertion.", "There is little information on cognitive function in Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), and no neuroimaging studies are available so far.\nTo assess cognitive function and brain volumes in patients with SRS.\nWechsler Intelligence Scale and brain magnetic resonance on a 3-Tesla scanner with Voxel-based morphometry analysis were performed between 2016 and 2018 in a single tertiary university center.\n38 white subjects with clinical diagnosis of SRS confirmed by molecular analysis: 30 of these patients (mean age 12.6 \u00b1 10 years) were enrolled for cognitive assessment; 23 of the 30 performed neuroimaging sequences. A control group of 33 school-aged children performed cognitive assessment while 65 age and sex-matched volunteers were included for the neuroradiological assessment.\nIntelligence quotient, Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), Working Memory Index (WMI), Processing Speed Index, and brain volume.\nThe mean overall IQ score was 87.2 \u00b1 17, and it was significantly lower in the maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (mUPD7) group at the age of 6 to 16 years compared to loss of methylation on chromosome 11p15 (11p15 LOM) group and to controls. VCI, PRI, and WMI were significantly higher in 11p15 LOM group and in control group than in mUPD7 group at the age of 6 to 16 years. There were no significant differences in cognitive scores between 11p15 LOM school-aged patients and the control group. SRS patients showed lower brain volume compared to controls at the frontal/temporal poles and globi pallidi.\nPatients with mUPD7 had an impaired cognitive profile. The brain volume at the frontal/temporal lobes and at the globi pallidi was reduced in patients with SRS.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.\nKey challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.\nThe safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.", "The evidence that quality of life is a positive variable for the survival of cancer patients has prompted the interest of the health and pharmaceutical industry in considering that variable as a final clinical outcome. Sustained improvements in cancer care in recent years have resulted in increased numbers of people living with and beyond cancer, with increased attention being placed on improving quality of life for those individuals. Connected Health provides the foundations for the transformation of cancer care into a patient-centric model, focused on providing fully connected, personalized support and therapy for the unique needs of each patient. Connected Health creates an opportunity to overcome barriers to health care support among patients diagnosed with chronic conditions. This paper provides an overview of important areas for the foundations of the creation of a new Connected Health paradigm in cancer care. Here we discuss the capabilities of mobile and wearable technologies; we also discuss pervasive and persuasive strategies and device systems to provide multidisciplinary and inclusive approaches for cancer patients for mental well-being, physical activity promotion, and rehabilitation. Several examples already show that there is enthusiasm in strengthening the possibilities offered by Connected Health in persuasive and pervasive technology in cancer care. Developments harnessing the Internet of Things, personalization, patient-centered design, and artificial intelligence help to monitor and assess the health status of cancer patients. Furthermore, this paper analyses the data infrastructure ecosystem for Connected Health and its semantic interoperability with the Connected Health economy ecosystem and its associated barriers. Interoperability is essential when developing Connected Health solutions that integrate with health systems and electronic health records. Given the exponential business growth of the Connected Health economy, there is an urgent need to develop mHealth (mobile health) exponentially, making it both an attractive and challenging market. In conclusion, there is a need for user-centered and multidisciplinary standards of practice to the design, development, evaluation, and implementation of Connected Health interventions in cancer care to ensure their acceptability, practicality, feasibility, effectiveness, affordability, safety, and equity.", "To investigate the feasibility of training an artificial intelligence (AI) on a public-available AI platform to diagnose polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) using indocyanine green angiography (ICGA).\nTwo methods using AI models were trained by a data set including 430 ICGA images of normal, neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD), and PCV eyes on a public-available AI platform. The one-step method distinguished normal, nvAMD, and PCV images simultaneously. The two-step method identifies normal and abnormal ICGA images at the first step and diagnoses PCV from the abnormal ICGA images at the second step. The method with higher performance was used to compare with retinal specialists and ophthalmologic residents on the performance of diagnosing PCV.\nThe two-step method had better performance, in which the precision was 0.911 and the recall was 0.911 at the first step, and the precision was 0.783, and the recall was 0.783 at the second step. For the test data set, the two-step method distinguished normal and abnormal images with an accuracy of 1 and diagnosed PCV with an accuracy of 0.83, which was comparable to retinal specialists and superior to ophthalmologic residents.\nIn this evaluation of ICGA images from normal, nvAMD, and PCV eyes, the models trained on a public-available AI platform had comparable performance to retinal specialists for diagnosing PCV. The utility of public-available AI platform might help everyone including ophthalmologists who had no AI-related resources, especially those in less developed areas, for future studies.", "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most complex and aggressive type of breast cancer encountered world widely in women. Absence of hormonal receptors on breast cancer cells necessitates the chemotherapy as the only treatment regime. High propensity to metastasize and relapse in addition to poor prognosis and survival motivated the oncologist, nano-medical scientist to develop novel and efficient nanotherapies to solve such a big TNBC challenge. Recently, the focus for enhanced availability, targeted cellular uptake with minimal toxicity is achieved by nano-carriers. These smart nano-carriers carrying all the necessary arsenals (drugs, tracking probe, and ligand) designed in such a way that specifically targets the TNBC cells at site. Articulating the targeted delivery system with multifunctional molecules for high specificity, tracking, diagnosis, and treatment emerged as theranostic approach. In this review, in addition to classical treatment modalities, recent advances in nanotheranostics for early and effective diagnostic and treatment is discussed. This review highlighted the recently FDA approved immunotherapy and all the ongoing clinical trials for TNBC, in addition to nanoparticle assisted immunotherapy. Futuristic but realistic advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning not only improve early diagnosis but also assist clinicians for their workup in TNBC. The novel concept of Nanoparticles induced endothelial leakiness (NanoEL) as a way of tumor invasion is also discussed in addition to classical EPR effect. This review intends to provide basic insight and understanding of the novel nano-therapeutic modalities in TNBC diagnosis and treatment and to sensitize the readers for continue designing the novel nanomedicine. This is the first time that designing nanoparticles with stoichiometric definable number of antibodies per nanoparticle now represents the next level of precision by design in nanomedicine.", "We report the results of a survey conducted among ESR members in November and December 2018, asking for expectations about artificial intelligence (AI) in 5-10 years. Of 24,000 ESR members contacted, 675 (2.8%) completed the survey, 454 males (67%), 555 (82%) working at academic/public hospitals. AI impact was mostly expected (\u2265 30% of responders) on breast, oncologic, thoracic, and neuro imaging, mainly involving mammography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance. Responders foresee AI impact on: job opportunities (375/675, 56%), 218/375 (58%) expecting increase, 157/375 (42%) reduction; reporting workload (504/675, 75%), 256/504 (51%) expecting reduction, 248/504 (49%) increase; radiologist's profile, becoming more clinical (364/675, 54%) and more subspecialised (283/675, 42%). For 374/675 responders (55%) AI-only reports would be not accepted by patients, for 79/675 (12%) accepted, for 222/675 (33%) it is too early to answer. For 275/675 responders (41%) AI will make the radiologist-patient relation more interactive, for 140/675 (21%) more impersonal, for 259/675 (38%) unchanged. If AI allows time saving, radiologists should interact more with clinicians (437/675, 65%) and/or patients (322/675, 48%). For all responders, involvement in AI-projects is welcome, with different roles: supervision (434/675, 64%), task definition (359/675, 53%), image labelling (197/675, 29%). Of 675 responders, 321 (48%) do not currently use AI, 138 (20%) use AI, 205 (30%) are planning to do it. According to 277/675 responders (41%), radiologists will take responsibility for AI outcome, while 277/675 (41%) suggest shared responsibility with other professionals. To summarise, responders showed a general favourable attitude towards AI.", "We aimed to assess the attitudes and learner needs of radiology residents and faculty radiologists regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in radiology.\nA web-based questionnaire, designed using SurveyMonkey, was sent out to residents and faculty radiologists in all three radiology residency programmes in Singapore. The questionnaire comprised four sections and aimed to evaluate respondents' current experience, attempts at self-learning, perceptions of career prospects and expectations of an AI/ML curriculum in their residency programme. Respondents' anonymity was ensured.\nA total of 125 respondents (86 male, 39 female; 70 residents, 55 faculty radiologists) completed the questionnaire. The majority agreed that AI/ML will drastically change radiology practice (88.8%) and makes radiology more exciting (76.0%), and most would still choose to specialise in radiology if given a choice (80.0%). 64.8% viewed themselves as novices in their understanding of AI/ML, 76.0% planned to further advance their AI/ML knowledge and 67.2% were keen to get involved in an AI/ML research project. An overwhelming majority (84.8%) believed that AI/ML knowledge should be taught during residency, and most opined that this was as important as imaging physics and clinical skills/knowledge curricula (80.0% and 72.8%, respectively). More than half thought that their residency programme had not adequately implemented AI/ML teaching (59.2%). In subgroup analyses, male and tech-savvy respondents were more involved in AI/ML activities, leading to better technical understanding.\nA growing optimism towards radiology undergoing technological transformation and AI/ML implementation has led to a strong demand for an AI/ML curriculum in residency education.", "Accurate diagnosis and prognosis are essential in lung cancer treatment selection and planning. With the rapid advance of medical imaging technology, whole slide imaging (WSI) in pathology is becoming a routine clinical procedure. An interplay of needs and challenges exists for computer-aided diagnosis based on accurate and efficient analysis of pathology images. Recently, artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, has shown great potential in pathology image analysis tasks such as tumor region identification, prognosis prediction, tumor microenvironment characterization, and metastasis detection.\nIn this review, we aim to provide an overview of current and potential applications for AI methods in pathology image analysis, with an emphasis on lung cancer.\nWe outlined the current challenges and opportunities in lung cancer pathology image analysis, discussed the recent deep learning developments that could potentially impact digital pathology in lung cancer, and summarized the existing applications of deep learning algorithms in lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis.\nWith the advance of technology, digital pathology could have great potential impacts in lung cancer patient care. We point out some promising future directions for lung cancer pathology image analysis, including multi-task learning, transfer learning, and model interpretation.", "Some phthalates are known endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). They are widely present in the environment thus their impact on children's health is of particular scientific interest. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between phthalate exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes, in particular behavioral, cognitive and psychomotor development, in 250 early school age children from the Polish Mother and Child Cohort (REPRO_PL). Urine samples were collected at the time of children's neurodevelopmental assessment and were analysed for 21 metabolites of 11 parent phthalates. Behavioral and emotional problems were assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) filled in by the mothers. To assess children's cognitive and psychomotor development, Polish adaptation of the Intelligence and Development Scales (IDS) was administered. The examination was performed by trained psychologists. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) were the two phthalates showing the highest statistically significant associations, with higher total difficulties scores (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f1.5, 95% CI 0.17; 2.7; \u03b2\u202f=\u202f1.5, 95% CI 0.25; 2.8, respectively) as well as emotional symptoms and hyperactivity/inattention problems for DnBP (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.46, 95% CI -0.024; 0.94; \u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.72, 95% CI 0.065; 1.4, respectively), and peer relationships problems for DMP (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.37, 95% CI -0.013; 0.76). In addition, DnBP and DMP have been found to be negatively associated with fluid IQ (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.14, 95% CI -0.29; 0.0041) and crystallized IQ (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.16, 95% CI -0.29; -0.025), respectively. In the case of mathematical skills, three phthalates, namely DMP (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.17, 95% CI -0.31; -0.033), DEP (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.16, 95% CI -0.29; -0.018) and DnBP (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.14, 95% CI -0.28; 0.0012), have also shown statistically significant associations. This study indicates that exposure to some phthalates seems to be associated with adverse effects on behavioral and cognitive development of early school age children. Further action including legislation, educational and interventional activities to protect this vulnerable population is still needed.", "Using a \"theory of mind\" allows us to explain and predict others' behavior in terms of their mental states, yet individual differences in the accuracy of mental state inferences are not well understood. We hypothesized that the accuracy of mental state inferences can be explained by the ability to characterize the mind giving rise to the mental state. Under this proposal, individuals differentiate between minds by representing them in \"Mind-space\"-a multidimensional space where dimensions reflect any characteristic of minds that allows them to be individuated. Individual differences in the representation of minds and the accuracy of mental state inferences are explained by one's model of how minds can vary (Mind-space) and ability to locate an individual mind within this space. We measured the accuracy of participants' model of the covariance between dimensions in Mind-space that represent personality traits, and we found this was associated with the accuracy of mental state inference (Experiment 1). Mind-space accuracy also predicted the ability to locate others within Mind-space on dimensions of personality and intelligence (Experiment 2). Direct evidence for the representation of minds in mental state inference was obtained by showing that the location of others in Mind-space affects the probability of particular mental states being ascribed to them (Experiment 3). This latter effect extended to mental states dependent upon representation of trait covariation (Experiment 4). Results support the claim that mental state inference varies according to location in Mind-space, and therefore that adopting the Mind-space framework can explain some of the individual differences in theory of mind.

Whether these ERP alterations and correlated dysfunctions exist in healthy parents with ADHD offspring is worth exploring.\nThirteen healthy parents with ADHD offspring and thirteen healthy controls matched for age, sex and years of education were recruited. The auditory oddball paradigm was used to evaluate the P300 wave complex of the ERP, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and continuous performance test were used to measure neurocognitive performance.\nHealthy parents with ADHD offspring had significantly longer auditory P300 latency at Fz than control group. However, no significant differences were found in cognitive performance.\nThe presence of a subtle alteration in electro-neurophysiological activity without explicit neurocognitive dysfunction suggests potential candidate of biological marker for parents with ADHD offspring.", "By constructing mutant libraries and utilizing high-throughput screening methods, directed evolution has emerged as the most popular strategy for protein design nowadays. In the past decade, taking advantages of computer performance and algorithms, computer-assisted protein design has rapidly developed and become a powerful method of protein engineering. Based on the simulation of protein structure and calculation of energy function, computational design can alter the substrate specificity and improve the thermostability of enzymes, as well as de novo design of artificial enzymes with expected functions. Recently, machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies have also been applied to computational protein engineering, resulting in a series of remarkable applications. Along the lines of protein engineering, this paper reviews the progress and applications of computer-assisted protein design, and current trends and outlooks of the development.\n\u5b9a\u5411\u8fdb\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u7a81\u53d8\u4f53\u6587\u5e93\u4e0e\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u63d0\u5347\u86cb\u767d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5de5\u7a0b\u6700\u4e3a\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6539\u9020\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8fd1\u5341\u5e74\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8fd0\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4ee5\u53ca\u5148\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u65ad\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6539\u9020\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6781\u5927\u7684\u91cd\u89c6\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b0\u5f00\u8f9f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u4ee5\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u4f46\u80fd\u6539\u9020\u9176\u7684\u5e95\u7269\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ece\u5934\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u9176\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u4e5f\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6539\u9020\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u77a9\u76ee\u7684\u6210\u7ee9\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u7a0b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8bc4\u8ff0\u5f53\u524d\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6539\u9020\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u5176\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002.", "Neuromorphic architectures have become essential building blocks for next-generation computational systems, where intelligence is embedded directly onto low power, small area, and computationally efficient hardware devices. In such devices, realization of neural algorithms requires storage of weights in digital memories, which is a bottleneck in terms of power and area. We hereby propose a biologically inspired low power, hybrid architectural framework for wake-up systems. This architecture utilizes our novel high-performance, ultra-low power molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) based two-dimensional synaptic memtransistor as an analogue memory. Furthermore, it exploits random device mismatches to implement the population coding scheme. Power consumption per CMOS neuron block was found to be 3 nw in the 65\u2009nm process technology, while the energy consumption per cycle was 0.3 pJ for potentiation and 20 pJ for depression cycles of the synaptic device. The proposed framework was demonstrated for classification and regression tasks, using both off-chip and simplified on-chip sign-based learning techniques.", "The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship among spiritual intelligence, spiritual well-being and death anxiety among Iranian veterans. In this predictive correlational study, 211 veterans completed King and DeCicco's Spiritual Intelligence Scale, Paloutzian and Ellison's Spiritual Well-being Scale and Templer's Death Anxiety Scale-Extended. After confirming the reliability of the constructs using intra-class correlation coefficient, partial least squares structural equation modeling method was utilized to assess the impact of spiritual well-being and spiritual intelligence on death anxiety. This study found a significant positive relationship between spiritual intelligence and death anxiety after controlling for the effects of age, education level and disability. However, there was a significant negative relationship between spiritual well-being and death anxiety among Iranian veterans. Negative relationships were found between spiritual well-being and death anxiety among Iranian veterans. However, spiritual intelligence had a positive impact on death anxiety.", "Over the next decade, one issue which will dominate sociotechnical studies in health informatics is the extent to which the promise of artificial intelligence in health care will be realized, along with the social and ethical issues which accompany it. A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care (such as chatbots or conversational agents). In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future. In health care, artificial intelligence needs to pass the implementation game, not the imitation game.", "In the second part of this Essay, we leave philosophy, and begin by describing Roald's being trashed by simulation. This leads us to a general sketch of artificial intelligence (AI), Searle's Chinese room, and Strevens' account of what a go-playing program knows. Back to our terrain-we ask \"Quantum Chemistry, \u2020 ca. 2020?\" Then we move to examples of Big Data, machine learning and neural networks in action, first in chemistry and then affecting social matters, trivial to scary. We argue that moral decisions are hardly to be left to a computer. And that posited causes, even if recognized as provisional, represent a much deeper level of understanding than correlations. At this point, we try to pull the reader up, giving voice to the opposing view of an optimistic, limitless future. But we don't do justice to that view-how could we, older mammals on the way to extinction that we are? We try. But then we return to fuss, questioning the ascetic dimension of scientists, their romance with black boxes. And argue for a science of many tongues.", "Systems neuroscience seeks explanations for how the brain implements a wide variety of perceptual, cognitive and motor tasks. Conversely, artificial intelligence attempts to design computational systems based on the tasks they will have to solve. In artificial neural networks, the three components specified by design are the objective functions, the learning rules and the architectures. With the growing success of deep learning, which utilizes brain-inspired architectures, these three designed components have increasingly become central to how we model, engineer and optimize complex artificial learning systems. Here we argue that a greater focus on these components would also benefit systems neuroscience. We give examples of how this optimization-based framework can drive theoretical and experimental progress in neuroscience. We contend that this principled perspective on systems neuroscience will help to generate more rapid progress.", "This is a narrative review of telemonitoring (remote monitoring) projects and studies within the field of diabetes, with a focus on results of the more recent studies. Since the beginning of the 1990s, several telemedicine projects and studies focused on type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Over the last 5 years, numerous telemedicine projects based on connected objects and new information and communication technologies (ICT) (elements defining telemedicine 2.0) have emerged or are still under development. Two examples are the DIABETe and Telesage telemonitoring project which perfectly fits within the telemedicine 2.0 framework - the first to include artificial intelligence (AI) with MyPrediTM and DiabeoTM. Mainly, these projects and studies show that telemonitoring diabetic result in: improvements in control of blood glucose (BG) level and significant reduction in HbA1c (e.g., for Telescot et TELESAGE studies); positive impact on co-morbidities (arterial hypertension, weight, dyslipidemia) (e.g., for Telescot and DIABETe studies); better patient's quality of life (e.g., for DIABETe study); positive impact on appropriation of the disease by patients and/or greater adherence to therapeutic and hygiene-dietary measures (e.g., The Utah Remote Monitoring Project); and at least, good receptiveness by patients and their empowerment. To date, the magnitude of its effects remains debatable, especially with the variation in patients' characteristics (e.g., background, ability for self-management, medical condition), samples selection and approach for the treatment of control groups. All of the recent studies have been classified as \"Moderate\" to \"High\".", "Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most frequent congenital malformation. With recent advances in medical care, the majority of patients with CHD survive into adulthood. As a result, interest has shifted towards the neurodevelopmental outcome of these patients, and particularly towards the early detection and treatment of developmental problems. A variety of mild to moderate cognitive impairments as well as emotional and behavioural problems has been observed in this population. However, a more detailed assessment of the various domains of executive function and their association with structural and functional brain development is lacking. Therefore, the current study will examine all domains of executive function and brain development in detail in a large sample of children and adolescents with CHD and healthy control children.\nA total of 192 children and adolescents with CHD aged 10-15 years, who participated in prospective cohort studies at the University Children's Hospital Zurich, will be eligible for this study. As a control group, approximately 100 healthy children will be enrolled. Primary outcome measures will include executive function abilities, while secondary outcomes will consist of other neurodevelopmental measures, including intelligence, processing speed, attention, fine motor abilities and brain development. An MRI will be performed to assess structural and functional brain development. Linear regression analyses will be applied to investigate group differences and associations between executive function performance and neurodevelopmental measures.\nThis study is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF 32003B_172914) and approved by the ethical committee of the Canton Zurich (KEK 2019-00035). Written informed consent will be obtained from all the parents and from children aged 14 years or older. Findings from this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences for widespread dissemination of the results.", "The Wilson-Cowan equations were originally shown to produce limit cycle oscillations for a range of parameters. Others subsequently showed that two coupled Wilson-Cowan oscillators could produce chaos, especially if the oscillator coupling was from inhibitory interneurons of one oscillator to excitatory neurons of the other. Here this is extended to show that chains, grids, and sparse networks of Wilson-Cowan oscillators generate hyperchaos with linearly increasing complexity as the number of oscillators increases. As there is now evidence that humans can voluntarily generate hyperchaotic visuomotor sequences, these results are particularly relevant to the unpredictability of a range of human behaviors. These also include incipient senescence in aging, effects of concussive brain injuries, autism, and perhaps also intelligence and creativity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This paper represents an exploration of hyperchaos in coupled Wilson-Cowan equations. Results show that hyperchaos (number of positive Lyapunov exponents) grows linearly with the number of oscillators in the array and leads to high levels of unpredictability in the neural response.", "The aim of the study was to compare the hippocampus sizes of healthy medical faculty students, who were exposed to an intense data input and who underwent serious learning activity and those of healthy sport faculty students who did sports regularly by using MR images and to examine the relationship between a hippocampus size and intelligence.\nWe made the study with 58 healthy young males (27 sport sciences faculty students and 31 medical faculty students). R. B. Cattell 3A Culture Fair Intelligence Test was administered to the volunteers. Following this, we got MR images of our volunteers.\nWe could not find a statistically significant difference between medical faculty students and sport sciences faculty students in terms of hippocampus volumes. We could not find a correlation between IQ values and hippocampus volumes. Also, we could not find a significant difference between a right and left hippocampus.\nWhile doing sport, blood flow increases in the hippocampus, as in all areas of the body. This increased blood flow creates a stimulating effect on neurogenesis. Neurons, which develop as the result of neurogenesis, mean an increase in volume (Tab. 4, Ref. 54).", "Artificial intelligence permits cerebral processes to be analyzed like computing processes. We can recognize two disturbing lines we can call: The Robot Project, android when is anthropomorphic, and The Cyborg Project. Robots are destined to perform repetitive, risky or accurate tasks in which they can surpass human limitations. No ethical conflicts are perceived here but there are new challenges to be faced as far as the social organization is concerned. As regards androids, apart from their robotic capabilities, their effect on the human being during interaction should be considered, as the impact of mimic's android on the emotion. The cyborgs are creatures composed by biological and cybernetic elements whose goal is to improve the capabilities of their biological parts. There has been no evidence of conflict in their use for rehabilitation or to supply impaired or non-existing functions. It would be different if they were used for manipulative activities. Another application of the cyborg project to consider is the term \"enhancement\", used to describe the increase of neurocognitive or sensory faculties through transcranial/intracranial stimulation. The ethical conflict here lies in the fact that the focus is not so much on healing but on seeking perfectibility or new modalities of perception. Health professionals must act in a new and constantly changing environment that transcends neurosciences and public health. Progress never stops; so, society have to be informed, anticipate dilemmas, and make room for reflection to help decision-making processes that involve individuals as well as the whole human species.\nLa inteligencia artificial permite que los procesos cerebrales sean analizados como procesos computacionales.

Our aim was to evaluate cognitive and motor impairment and to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes among children with IF.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional single-center study at the Helsinki University Children's Hospital. Patients with IF with >60 days of parental nutrition (PN) dependency aged between 3 and 16 years (n\u200a=\u200a40) were invited to participate. The cognitive and motor skills were evaluated using validated tests: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 3rd edition, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition, and Movement Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd edition.\nAll the patients attending the study tests (n\u200a=\u200a30, males\u200a=\u200a24) were included. Their median age, gestational age, and birth weight was 7.5 (range 3-16) years, 35 (interquartile range [IQR] 28-38) weeks and 2238 (IQR 1040-3288) grams, respectively. Median duration of PN was 13 (IQR 5-37) months and 9 patients were currently on PN. Median intelligence quotient was 78 (IQR 65-91) and 10 (35%) patients had an intelligence quotient under 70 (-2 standard deviation). Significant motor impairment was detected in 10 patients (36%) and milder difficulties in 8 (28%). Adverse cognitive outcome was associated with neonatal short bowel syndrome, number of interventions under general anesthesia, and length of inpatient status, whereas adverse motor outcome was associated with prematurity.\nClinically significant cognitive and motor impairments are alarmingly common among neonatal patients with IF. We recommend early neurodevelopmental follow-up for all children with IF.", "Health care systems worldwide are struggling to keep rising costs at bay with only modest outcome improvement among many diseases. Digitization with technologies like Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning algorithms might address this. Although digital technologies have been successfully applied in clinical studies the effect on the overall health care system so far was limited. The regulatory ecosystem or data privacy might be responsible, but other reasons may also predominate.\nWe analyzed how the digitization of the German health care market is currently perceived among different stakeholders and investigated reasons for its slow adaption.\nThis was a mixed methods study split into a qualitative Part A using the conceptual approach of the Grounded Theory and a quantitative Part B using the Delphi method. For Part A we interviewed experts in the health care system and converted the results into 17 hypotheses. The Delphi method consisted of an online survey which was sent to the participants via email and was available for three months. For the assessment of the 17 hypotheses, the participants were given a six-point Likert scale. The participants were grouped into patients, physicians, and providers of services within the German health care market.\nThere was a strong alignment of opinions on the hypotheses between experts (N=21) and survey participants (N=733), with 70.5% overall agreement on 12/17 hypotheses. Physicians demonstrated the lowest level of agreement with the expert panel at 88% (15/17) disagreement, with the hypotheses \"H8: Digitization in the health care system will free up jobs,\" and \"H6: Digitization in the health care system will empower the patients,\" perceived to be in profound disagreement (P=.036 and P<.001, respectively).\nDespite the firm agreement among participants and experts regarding the impact of digitization on the health care system, physicians demonstrated a more negative attitude. We assume that this might be a factor contributing to the slow adoption of digitization in practice. Physicians might be struggling with changing power structures, so future measures to transform the market should involve them to a larger degree.", "When an automated car harms someone, who is blamed by those who hear about it? Here we asked human participants to consider hypothetical cases in which a pedestrian was killed by a car operated under shared control of a primary and a secondary driver and to indicate how blame should be allocated. We find that when only one driver makes an error, that driver is blamed more regardless of whether that driver is a machine or a human. However, when both drivers make errors in cases of human-machine shared-control vehicles, the blame attributed to the machine is reduced. This finding portends a public under-reaction to the malfunctioning artificial intelligence components of automated cars and therefore has a direct policy implication: allowing the de facto standards for shared-control vehicles to be established in courts by the jury system could fail to properly regulate the safety of those vehicles; instead, a top-down scheme (through federal laws) may be called for.", "Artificial intelligence is a growing phenomenon that is driving major changes to how we deliver healthcare. One of its most significant and challenging contributions is likely to be in diagnosis. Artificial intelligence is challenging the physician's exclusive role in diagnosis and in some areas, its diagnostic accuracy exceeds that of humans. We argue that we urgently need to consider how we will incorporate AI into our teaching of clinical reasoning in the undergraduate curriculum; students need to successfully navigate the benefits and potential issues of new and developing approaches to AI in clinical diagnosis. We offer a pedagogical framework for this challenging change to our curriculum.", "Cognitive brain networks such as the default-mode network (DMN), frontoparietal network, and salience network, are key functional networks of the human brain. Here we show that the rapid evolutionary cortical expansion of cognitive networks in the human brain, and most pronounced the DMN, runs parallel with high expression of human-accelerated genes (HAR genes). Using comparative transcriptomics analysis, we present that HAR genes are differentially more expressed in higher-order cognitive networks in humans compared to chimpanzees and macaques and that genes with high expression in the DMN are involved in synapse and dendrite formation. Moreover, HAR and DMN genes show significant associations with individual variations in DMN functional activity, intelligence, sociability, and mental conditions such as schizophrenia and autism. Our results suggest that the expansion of higher-order functional networks subserving increasing cognitive properties has been an important locus of genetic changes in recent human brain evolution.", "According to the intelligence-creativity threshold hypothesis, there should be a positive association between intelligence and creative potential up to a certain point, the threshold, after which a further increase in intelligence should have no association with creativity. In the present simulation study, the measured intelligence and creativity of virtual subjects were affected by their true abilities as well as a disturbance factor that varied in magnitude between subjects. The results indicate that the hypothesized threshold-like association could be due to some disturbing factor, for example, low motivation, illness, or linguistic confusion, that varies between individuals and that affects both measured intelligence and measured creativity, especially if the actual association between intelligence and creativity is weak. This, together with previous negative findings, calls the validity of the intelligence-creativity threshold hypothesis into question.", "Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are xenobiotics with the ability to interfere with hormone action, even at low levels. Prior environmental epidemiology studies link numerous suspected EDCs, including phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, results for some chemicals were inconsistent and most assessed one chemical at a time.\nTo evaluate the overall impact of prenatal exposure to an EDC mixture on neurodevelopment in school-aged children, and identify chemicals of concern while accounting for co-exposures.\nAmong 718 mother-child pairs from the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy study (SELMA) study, we used Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to assess the association between 26 EDCs measured in 1st trimester urine or blood, with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (IV) Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores at age 7\u202fyears. Models were adjusted for child sex, gestational age, mother's education, mother's IQ (RAVEN), weight, and smoking status. To evaluate generalizability, we conducted repeated holdout validation, a machine learning technique.\nUsing repeated holdout validation, IQ scores were 1.9-points (CI\u202f=\u202f-3.6, -0.2) lower among boys for an inter-quartile-range (IQR) change in the WQS index. BPF made the largest contribution to the index with a weight of 14%. Other chemicals of concern and their weights included PBA (9%), TCP (9%), MEP (6%), MBzP (4%), PFOA (6%), PFOS (5%), PFHxS (4%), Triclosan (5%), and BPA (4%). While we did observe an inverse association between EDCs and IQ among all children when training and testing the WQS index estimate on the full dataset, these results were not robust to repeated holdout validation.\nAmong boys, early prenatal exposure to EDCs was associated with lower intellectual functioning at age 7. We identified bisphenol F as the primary chemical of concern, suggesting that the BPA replacement compound may not be any safer for children. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential neurotoxicity of replacement analogues.", "We investigate the capacities of an organization responsible for bridging top-down instructions emanating from a law on public health with the bottom-up realities of health service providers working on population-based health. This article traces the implementation of this law, which requires service-provider organizations to base their actions (planning, prevention, and curative activities) upon the expressed and non-expressed needs of the local population. We investigate a case in the province of Qu\u00e9bec that took place over more than 10\u00a0years.\nThe state strategy involved a key structure: an intermediary organization named IPCDC/KSCDI. We first describe how the organization emerged; the expertise involved from the academic, service, and policy domains; the support provided to service-provider organizations; and the achievements. We then highlight the critical capacities the intermediary organization had to nurture.\nWe identify five critical capacities of the intermediary organization: the business intelligence to read and adjust to the given environment of certain organizations, a dedication to collective means, a win-win mentality, scientific connectivity, and the animation of safe havens.\nIt may be important to focus attention on a capacity approach to intermediary organizations. These capacities can potentially enable governmental organizations to compile a stock of resources that can be mobilized and transferred to support future implementations of other reforms. They could also benefit public health partners in the community who collaborate with service providers and actors who aspire to become intermediary organizations. Finally, the performance measurement of implementing reforms in a non-directive manner could be based on indicators related to these five critical capacities.\nNous \u00e9tudions les capacit\u00e9s d\u2019un organisme charg\u00e9 de concilier les instructions dict\u00e9es par une loi de sant\u00e9 publique avec les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s \u00e9mergentes des prestataires de services de sant\u00e9 travaillant sur le terrain.

Nurses need to respond to their stressful environment contents to reduce negative consequences. We examined the role of dimensions of emotional intelligence in predicting coping reactions to stress in 201 college nursing practitioners in this cross-sectional study between November 2017 and January 2018. The nurses appraised their own emotions, but they were not sure that appraised others' emotions, regulated their and others' emotions. They could cope with new ideas and faced obstacles. Most of the nurses were moderately stressed. Those nurses were not able to regulate their own emotions were determined to have a higher level of perceived stress. Active coping, positive reframing and acceptance were the most prevalent coping mechanisms. The investigation showed that others' emotion appraisal was a predictor for self-blame reaction, and emotion utilization was the predictor for positive reframing and self-blame.", "Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with PCDH19-female limited epilepsy (PCDH19-FE). Methods: The clinical data of 60 female epilepsy patients with PCDH19 gene heterozygous variations at the Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital from October 2007 to December 2018 were collected and analyzed retrospectively, their clinical manifestations, accessory examination and follow-up treatment were summarized. Results: Data of a total of 60 cases of PCDH19-FE were collected. The seizure onset occurred between 4 and 42 months of age (median: 11 months of age). Focal seizures occurred in 47 patients (78%), generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) occurred in 30 patients (50%), and other rare types of seizures included atypical absence, myoclonic, clonic, tonic, and atonic seizures. Two or more seizures types existed in 24 patients (40%), and seven patients (12%) had attacks of status epilepticus. Sensitivity to fever was observed in 47 out of them (78%) and clustering of seizures as found in all patients. During the interictal phase, focal discharges were monitored in 22 cases (22/45, 49%), multifocal discharges in 12 cases (12/45, 27%), widely discharging in 2 cases (4%), and both focal and widely discharging in 9 cases (20%). Clinical seizures were detected in 30 patients during the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, including focal seizures in 22 cases, GTCS seizures in 8 cases, tonic seizure in three cases, myoclonic seizure followed by GTCS in one case, and two types of seizures in four cases. Before seizure onset, 57 patients had normal development and three patients had delayed language development. After seizure onset, varied degrees of intelligence disability were present in 38 cases (63%), language delay in 36 cases (60%), and gait instability in 10 cases (17%). Autistic features occurred in 17 cases (28%); and other behavioral problems like learning difficulties, personality, or emotional disorders existed in 33 cases (55%). Age at last follow-up ranged from one year and 3 months to 22 years and 3 months of age, 17 patients (28%) were seizure-free for more than 2 years (5 to 22 years at the last follow-up). The efficiency of antiepileptic drugs were 65% (33/51) in sodium valproate, 63% (27/43) in levetiracetam and 59% (20/34) in topiramate. Conclusions: The clinical features of PCDH19-FE are characterized by clustering of seizures, focal seizures in most cases, sensitivity to fever mostly, focal discharges principally in EEG, varied degrees of intellectual disability or movement disorder, combined with autism spectrum disorders in partial and high efficiency in sodium valproate or levetiracetam treatment.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u5206\u6790PCDH19\u57fa\u56e0\u53d8\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u5973\u6027\u766b\u75eb\u60a3\u513f\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u70b9\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u56de\u987e\u6027\u603b\u7ed3\u5206\u67902007\u5e7410\u6708\u81f32018\u5e7412\u6708\u5728\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e00\u533b\u9662\u513f\u79d1\u6536\u96c6\u7684PCDH19\u57fa\u56e0\u53d8\u5f02\u9633\u6027\u768460\u4f8b\u5973\u6027\u766b\u75eb\u60a3\u513f\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u4e34\u5e8a\u8868\u73b0\u3001\u8f85\u52a9\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u9884\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u603b\u7ed3\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a 60\u4f8bPCDH19\u57fa\u56e0\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u5973\u6027\u60a3\u513f\u8d77\u75c5\u5e74\u9f84\u4e3a11\uff084~42\uff09\u6708\u9f84\u3002\u75c5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c40\u7076\u6027\u53d1\u4f5c47\u4f8b\uff0878%\uff09\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u5f3a\u76f4\u9635\u631b\u53d1\u4f5c30\u4f8b\uff0850%\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u5c11\u89c1\u53d1\u4f5c\u7c7b\u578b\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u5178\u578b\u5931\u795e\u53d1\u4f5c\u3001\u808c\u9635\u631b\u53d1\u4f5c\u3001\u9635\u631b\u53d1\u4f5c\u3001\u5f3a\u76f4\u53d1\u4f5c\u548c\u5931\u5f20\u529b\u53d1\u4f5c\uff1b24\u4f8b\uff0840%\uff09\u6709\u22652\u79cd\u766b\u75eb\u53d1\u4f5c\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b7\u4f8b\uff0812%\uff09\u6709\u766b\u75eb\u6301\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\uff1b47\u4f8b\uff0878%\uff09\u60a3\u513f\u53d1\u4f5c\u6709\u70ed\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u513f\u5747\u6709\u4e1b\u96c6\u6027\u53d1\u4f5c\u7279\u70b9\u3002\u53d1\u4f5c\u95f4\u671f\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u76d1\u6d4b\u523045\u4f8b\u6709\u766b\u75eb\u6837\u653e\u7535\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5c40\u7076\u6027\u653e\u753522\u4f8b\uff0849%\uff09\uff0c\u591a\u7076\u6027\u653e\u753512\u4f8b\uff0827%\uff09\uff0c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6027\u653e\u75352\u4f8b\uff084%\uff09\uff0c\u65e2\u6709\u5c40\u7076\u6027\u53c8\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6027\u653e\u75359\u4f8b\uff0820%\uff09\uff1b30\u4f8b\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u76d1\u6d4b\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d1\u4f5c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5c40\u7076\u6027\u53d1\u4f5c22\u4f8b\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u5f3a\u76f4\u9635\u631b\u53d1\u4f5c8\u4f8b\uff0c\u5f3a\u76f4\u53d1\u4f5c3\u4f8b\uff0c\u808c\u9635\u631b\u53d1\u4f5c\u7ee7\u53d1\u5168\u9762\u5f3a\u76f4\u9635\u631b\u53d1\u4f5c1\u4f8b\uff0c4\u4f8b\u76d1\u6d4b\u52302\u79cd\u53d1\u4f5c\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u672b\u6b21\u968f\u8bbf\u5e74\u9f841\u5c813\u6708\u9f84~22\u5c811\u6708\u9f84\uff0c17\u4f8b\uff0828%\uff092\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\u65e0\u53d1\u4f5c\u3002\u8d77\u75c5\u524d57\u4f8b\u53d1\u80b2\u6b63\u5e38\uff0c3\u4f8b\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u53d1\u80b2\u843d\u540e\uff1b\u8d77\u75c5\u540e38\u4f8b\uff0863%\uff09\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u667a\u529b\u969c\u788d\uff0c36\u4f8b\uff0860%\uff09\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u843d\u540e\uff0c10\u4f8b\uff0817%\uff09\u6b65\u6001\u4e0d\u7a33\u300217\u4f8b\uff0828%\uff09\u60a3\u513f\u5408\u5e76\u6709\u5b64\u72ec\u75c7\u6837\u8868\u73b0\uff0c33\u4f8b\uff0855%\uff09\u5408\u5e76\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u6027\u683c\u884c\u4e3a\u6216\u60c5\u7eea\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u6297\u766b\u75eb\u836f\u7269\u6709\u6548\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u4e19\u620a\u9178\u94a065%\uff0833/51\uff09\uff0c\u5de6\u4e59\u62c9\u897f\u576663%\uff0827/43\uff09\uff0c\u6258\u5421\u916f59%\uff0820/34\uff09\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a PCDH19\u57fa\u56e0\u53d8\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u5973\u6027\u766b\u75eb\u60a3\u513f\u4ee5\u4e1b\u96c6\u6027\u53d1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c40\u7076\u6027\u53d1\u4f5c\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u591a\u6709\u70ed\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u4ee5\u5c40\u7076\u6027\u766b\u75eb\u6837\u653e\u7535\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u667a\u529b\u6216\u8fd0\u52a8\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u53ef\u5408\u5e76\u5b64\u72ec\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e19\u620a\u9178\u94a0\u548c\u5de6\u4e59\u62c9\u897f\u5766\u6709\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002.", "The artificial neural system has attracted tremendous attention in the field of artificial intelligence due to operate mode of parallel computation which is superior to traditional Von Neumann computers in processing complex sensory data and real-time situations with extremely low power dissipation. Remarkable progress has been made in the hardware-based electric-double-layer synaptic transistors as its modulation by ion movement is similar to biological synapse for the past few years. Unfortunately, long-term potentiation (LTP) timescale is still a big challenge in hardware-based electric-double-layer synaptic transistors which is essential to processing capacity and memory formation. Meanwhile, the effect of ion concentration on the synaptic plasticity has rarely been reported. Here, a solid state electrolyte-gated transistor using Ta2O5 as dielectric layer with unique ionic composition was demonstrated and the regulation of synaptic weight was realized by changing ion concentration. Both the potentiation and depression of synaptic weight such as excitatory post-synaptic current, inhibitory response (IPSC), paired pulse facilitation as well as LTP were successfully simulated. More importantly, oxygen vacancy content was tuned for the first time to modulate synaptic plasticity by varying film thickness and gas ratio, through which the intensity and duration of memory were enhanced with appropriate vacancy concentration. It indicated that appropriate vacancy concentration avoided the effects of internal electric field induced by ion excess, leading to a long-term memory. These results reveal a promising path to improve memory capacity of artificial synapse via ion modulation.", "The use of machine learning technology to automate intellectual processes and boost clinical process efficiency in medicine has exploded in the past 5 years. Machine learning excels in automating pattern recognition and in adapting learned representations to new settings. Moreover, machine learning techniques have the advantage of incorporating complexity and are free from many of the limitations of traditional deterministic approaches. Cochlear implants (CI) are a unique fit for machine learning techniques given the need for optimization of signal processing to fit complex environmental scenarios and individual patients' CI MAPping. However, there are many other opportunities where machine learning may assist in CI beyond signal processing. The objective of this review was to synthesize past applications of machine learning technologies for pediatric and adult CI and describe novel opportunities for research and development.\nThe PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases were mined using a directed search strategy to identify the nexus between CI and artificial intelligence/machine learning literature.\nNon-English language articles, articles without an available abstract or full-text, and nonrelevant articles were manually appraised and excluded. Included articles were evaluated for specific machine learning methodologies, content, and application success.\nThe database search identified 298 articles. Two hundred fifty-nine articles (86.9%) were excluded based on the available abstract/full-text, language, and relevance. The remaining 39 articles were included in the review analysis. There was a marked increase in year-over-year publications from 2013 to 2018. Applications of machine learning technologies involved speech/signal processing optimization (17; 43.6% of articles), automated evoked potential measurement (6; 15.4%), postoperative performance/efficacy prediction (5; 12.8%), and surgical anatomy location prediction (3; 7.7%), and 2 (5.1%) in each of robotics, electrode placement performance, and biomaterials performance.\nThe relationship between CI and artificial intelligence is strengthening with a recent increase in publications reporting successful applications. Considerable effort has been directed toward augmenting signal processing and automating postoperative MAPping using machine learning algorithms. Other promising applications include augmenting CI surgery mechanics and personalized medicine approaches for boosting CI patient performance. Future opportunities include addressing scalability and the research and clinical communities' acceptance of machine learning algorithms as effective techniques.", "As an interdisciplinary subject of medicine and artificial intelligence, intelligent diagnosis and treatment has received extensive attention. The standardization of Chinese medicine (CM) diagnosis has been always a bottleneck in the modernization and globalization of CM. Studying the application technology of artificial intelligence in CM and solving the problems is an urgent need for the development of modern CM in the era of artificial intelligence. Taking the pneumonia with dyspnea and cough in CM as an example, this article gives an overview of intelligent medical technology and application development, brings forward the present technical problems faced and the new advances in intelligent technology on CM diagnosis and treatment.", "Glaucoma is a result of irreversible damage to the retinal ganglion cells. While an early intervention could minimise the risk of vision loss in glaucoma, its asymptomatic nature makes it difficult to diagnose until a late stage. The diagnosis of glaucoma is a complicated and expensive effort that is heavily dependent on the experience and expertise of a clinician. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in ophthalmology has improved our understanding of many retinal, macular, choroidal and corneal pathologies. With the advent of deep learning, a number of tools for the classification, segmentation and enhancement of ocular images have been developed. Over the years, several AI techniques have been proposed to help detect glaucoma by analysis of functional and/or structural evaluations of the eye. Moreover, the use of AI has also been explored to improve the reliability of ascribing disease prognosis. This review summarises the role of AI in the diagnosis and prognosis of glaucoma, discusses the advantages and challenges of using AI systems in clinics and predicts likely areas of future progress.", "This paper will discuss whether bots, particularly chat bots, can be useful in public health research and health or pharmacy systems operations. Bots have been discussed for many years; particularly when coupled with artificial intelligence, they offer the opportunity of automating mundane or error-ridden processes and tasks by replacing human involvement. This paper will discuss areas where there are greater advances in the use of bots, as well as areas that may benefit from the use of bots, and will offer practical ways to get started with bot technology. Several popular bot applications and bot development tools along with practical security considerations will be discussed, and a toolbox that one can begin to use to implement bots will be presented.", "Memristor-based neuromorphic systems have been proposed as a promising alternative to von Neumann computing architectures, which are currently challenged by the ever-increasing computational power required by modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. The design and optimization of memristive devices for specific AI applications is thus of paramount importance, but still extremely complex, as many different physical mechanisms and their interactions have to be accounted for, which are, in many cases, not fully understood. The high complexity of the physical mechanisms involved and their partial comprehension are currently hampering the development of memristive devices and preventing their optimization. In this work, we tackle the application-oriented optimization of Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) devices using a multiscale modeling platform. The considered platform includes all the involved physical mechanisms (i.e., charge transport and trapping, and ion generation, diffusion, and recombination) and accounts for the 3D electric and temperature field in the device. Thanks to its multiscale nature, the modeling platform allows RRAM devices to be simulated and the microscopic physical mechanisms involved to be investigated, the device performance to be connected to the material's microscopic properties and geometries, the device electrical characteristics to be predicted, the effect of the forming conditions (i.e., temperature, compliance current, and voltage stress) on the device's performance and variability to be evaluated, the analog resistance switching to be optimized, and the device's reliability and failure causes to be investigated. The discussion of the presented simulation results provides useful insights for supporting the application-oriented optimization of RRAM technology according to specific AI applications, for the implementation of either non-volatile memories, deep neural networks, or spiking neural networks.", "Complex traits include, among many others, the evolution of eyes, wings, body forms, reproductive modes, human intelligence, social behavior, diseases, and chromosome morphology. Dollo's law states that the evolution of complex traits is irreversible. However, potential exceptions have been proposed. Here, we investigated whether reticulation, a simple and elegant means by which complex characters may be reacquired, could account for suggested reversals in the evolution of complex characters using two datasets with sufficient genetic coverage and a total of five potential reversals. Our analyses uncovered a potential reversal in the evolution of parity mode and a potential reversal in the evolution of placentotrophy of fish (Cyprinodontiformes) as reticulation events. Moreover, in a reptile that exhibits a potential reversal from viviparity to oviparity (Zootoca vivipara), reticulation provided the most parsimonious explanation for sex chromosome evolution. Therefore, three of the five studied potential reversals were unraveled as reticulation events. This constitutes the first evidence that accounting for reticulation can fundamentally influence the interpretation of the evolution of complex traits, that testing for reticulation is crucial for obtaining robust phylogenies, and that complex ancestral characters may be reacquired through hybridization with a lineage that still exhibits the trait. Hybridization, rather than reappearance of ancestral traits by means of small evolutionary steps, may thus account for suggested exceptions to Dollo's law. Consequently, ruling out reticulation is required to claim the evolutionary reversal of complex characters and potential exceptions to Dollo's rule.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been established in various parts of everyday life due to the instrumentalization of machines and robotics in industry, autonomous vehicles and the rapid development of computer-based systems.\nDemonstration of current developments and perspectives of AI in plastic surgery.\nEvaluation of statistics, press releases and original articles from journals and discussion of reviews.\nIn the healthcare system and in plastic surgery AI is particularly useful in the context of data analysis from digital patient files and big data from central registers. The use of 3D imaging systems provides objective feedback on surgical results in terms of volume and aesthetics. Intelligent robots assist plastic surgeons in microsurgical anastomoses of increasingly smaller vessels and the implementation of AI in the field of prosthetics enables patients to regain hand function following amputation injuries.\nFor the benefit of the patients, it is the responsibility of experimental surgery to explore the opportunities, risks and limitations of applications with AI.", "Sigma power during sleep is associated with cognitive abilities in healthy humans. We examined the relationship between sigma power in sleep EEG and intelligence and alertness in schoolchildren with ADHD (n = 17) in comparison to mentally healthy children (n = 16) and adults (n = 23). We observed a positive correlation between sigma power in sleep stage 2 and IQ in healthy adults but a negative correlation in children with ADHD. Furthermore, children with ADHD showed slower reaction times in alertness testing than both control groups. In contrast, only healthy children displayed a positive correlation between sigma power and reaction times. These data suggest that the associations between sigma power and cognitive performance underlie distinct developmental processes. A negative association between IQ and sigma power indicates a disturbed function of sleep in cognitive functions in ADHD, whereas the function of sleep appears to be matured early in case of motor-related alertness performance.", "Individual differences in working memory relate to performance differences in general cognitive ability. The neural bases of such individual differences, however, remain poorly understood. Here, using a data-driven technique known as connectome-based predictive modeling, we built models to predict individual working memory performance from whole-brain functional connectivity patterns. Using n-back or rest data from the Human Connectome Project, connectome-based predictive models significantly predicted novel individuals' 2-back accuracy. Model predictions also correlated with measures of fluid intelligence and, with less strength, sustained attention. Separate fluid intelligence models predicted working memory score, as did sustained attention models, again with less strength. Anatomical feature analysis revealed significant overlap between working memory and fluid intelligence models, particularly in utilization of prefrontal and parietal regions, and less overlap in predictive features between working memory and sustained attention models. Furthermore, showing the generality of these models, the working memory model developed from Human Connectome Project data generalized to predict memory in an independent data set of 157 older adults (mean age = 69 years; 48 healthy, 54 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, 55 Alzheimer disease). The present results demonstrate that distributed functional connectivity patterns predict individual variation in working memory capability across the adult life span, correlating with constructs including fluid intelligence and sustained attention.", "Many studies have been published on a variety of clinical applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for sepsis, while there is no overview of the literature. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the literature and thereby identify knowledge gaps and prioritize areas with high priority for further research. A literature search was conducted in PubMed from inception to February 2019. Search terms related to AI were combined with terms regarding sepsis. Articles were included when they reported an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUROC) as outcome measure. Fifteen articles on diagnosis of sepsis with AI models were included. The best performing model reached an AUROC of 0.97. There were also seven articles on prognosis, predicting mortality over time with an AUROC of up to 0.895. Finally, there were three articles on assistance of treatment of sepsis, where the use of AI was associated with the lowest mortality rates. Of the articles, twenty-two were judged to be at high risk of bias or had major concerns regarding applicability. This was mostly because predictor variables in these models, such as blood pressure, were also part of the definition of sepsis, which led to overestimation of the performance. We conclude that AI models have great potential for improving early identification of patients who may benefit from administration of antibiotics. Current AI prediction models to diagnose sepsis are at major risks of bias when the diagnosis criteria are part of the predictor variables in the model. Furthermore, generalizability of these models is poor due to overfitting and a lack of standardized protocols for the construction and validation of the models. Until these problems have been resolved, a large gap remains between the creation of an AI algorithm and its implementation in clinical practice.", "One major thrust in radiology today is image standardization with a focus on rapidly acquired quantitative multi-contrast information. This is critical for multi-center trials, for the collection of big data and for the use of artificial intelligence in evaluating the data. Strategically acquired gradient echo (STAGE) imaging is one such method that can provide 8 qualitative and 7 quantitative pieces of information in 5\u202fmin or less at 3\u202fT. STAGE provides qualitative images in the form of proton density weighted images, T1 weighted images, T2* weighted images and simulated double inversion recovery (DIR) images. STAGE also provides quantitative data in the form of proton spin density, T1, T2* and susceptibility maps as well as segmentation of white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid. STAGE uses vendors' product gradient echo sequences. It can be applied from 0.35\u202fT to 7\u202fT across all manufacturers producing similar results in contrast and quantification of the data. In this paper, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of STAGE, demonstrate its contrast-to-noise (CNR) behavior relative to a large clinical data set and introduce a few new image contrasts derived from STAGE, including DIR images and a new concept referred to as true susceptibility weighted imaging (tSWI) linked to fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or tSWI-FLAIR for the evaluation of multiple sclerosis lesions. The robustness of STAGE T1 mapping was tested using the NIST/NIH phantom, while the reproducibility was tested by scanning a given individual ten times in one session and the same subject scanned once a week over a 12-week period. Assessment of the CNR for the enhanced T1W image (T1WE) showed a significantly better contrast between gray matter and white matter than conventional T1W images in both patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. We also present some clinical cases using STAGE imaging in patients with stroke, metastasis, multiple sclerosis and a fetus with ventriculomegaly. Overall, STAGE is a comprehensive protocol that provides the clinician with numerous qualitative and quantitative images.", "In this study, we characterize the body of knowledge of groundwater remediation from 1950 to 2018 by employing scientometric techniques and CiteSpace software, based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) databases. The results indicate that the United States and China contributed 56.4% of the total publications and were the major powers in groundwater remediation research. In addition, the United States, Canada, and China have considerable capabilities and expertise in groundwater remediation research. Groundwater remediation research is a multidisciplinary field, covering water resources, environmental sciences and ecology, environmental sciences, and engineering, among other fields. Journals such as Environmental Science and Technology, Journal of Contaminant Hydrology, and Water Research were the major sources of cited works. The research fronts of groundwater remediation were transitioning from the pump-and-treat method to permeable reactive barriers and nanoscale zero\u2011valent iron particles. The combination of new persulfate ion\u2011activation technology and nanotechnology is receiving much attention. Based on the visualized networks, the intelligence base was verified using a variety of metrics. Through landscape portrayal and developmental trajectory identification of groundwater remediation research, this study provides insight into the characteristics of, and global trends in, groundwater remediation, which will facilitate the identification of future research directions.", "Physiological sensors can be used to detect changes in the emotional state of users with affective computing. This has lately been applied in the educational domain, aimed to better support learners during the learning process. For this purpose, we have developed the AICARP (Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform) infrastructure, which detects changes in the emotional state of the user and provides personalized multisensorial support to help manage the emotional state by taking advantage of ambient intelligence features. We have developed a third version of this infrastructure, AICARP.V3, which addresses several problems detected in the data acquisition stage of the second version, (i.e., intrusion of the pulse sensor, poor resolution and low signal to noise ratio in the galvanic skin response sensor and slow response time of the temperature sensor) and extends the capabilities to integrate new actuators. This improved incorporates a new acquisition platform (shield) called PhyAS (Physiological Acquisition Shield), which reduces the number of control units to only one, and supports both gathering physiological signals with better precision and delivering multisensory feedback with more flexibility, by means of new actuators that can be added/discarded on top of just that single shield. The improvements in the quality of the acquired signals allow better recognition of the emotional states. Thereof, AICARP.V3 gives a more accurate personalized emotional support to the user, based on a rule-based approach that triggers multisensorial feedback, if necessary. This represents progress in solving an open problem: develop systems that perform as effectively as a human expert in a complex task such as the recognition of emotional states.", "Obesity is associated with changes in the plasma lipids. Although simple lipid quantification is routinely used, plasma lipids are rarely investigated at the level of individual molecules. We aimed at predicting different measures of obesity based on the plasma lipidome in a large population cohort using advanced machine learning modeling. A total of 1,061 participants of the FINRISK 2012 population cohort were randomly chosen, and the levels of 183 plasma lipid species were measured in a novel mass spectrometric shotgun approach. Multiple machine intelligence models were trained to predict obesity estimates, i.e., body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage (BFP), and validated in 250 randomly chosen participants of the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Cardiovascular Cohort (MDC-CC). Comparison of the different models revealed that the lipidome predicted BFP the best (R2 = 0.73), based on a Lasso model. In this model, the strongest positive and the strongest negative predictor were sphingomyelin molecules, which differ by only 1 double bond, implying the involvement of an unknown desaturase in obesity-related aberrations of lipid metabolism. Moreover, we used this regression to probe the clinically relevant information contained in the plasma lipidome and found that the plasma lipidome also contains information about body fat distribution, because WHR (R2 = 0.65) was predicted more accurately than BMI (R2 = 0.47). These modeling results required full resolution of the lipidome to lipid species level, and the predicting set of biomarkers had to be sufficiently large. The power of the lipidomics association was demonstrated by the finding that the addition of routine clinical laboratory variables, e.g., high-density lipoprotein (HDL)- or low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- cholesterol did not improve the model further. Correlation analyses of the individual lipid species, controlled for age and separated by sex, underscores the multiparametric and lipid species-specific nature of the correlation with the BFP. Lipidomic measurements in combination with machine intelligence modeling contain rich information about body fat amount and distribution beyond traditional clinical assays.", "In a sluggish economy, cost containment is a central issue for the national health service, and health authorities are increasingly requiring proof of the economic and clinical value of health interventions. In this context, the integration and/or evolution of techniques to measure the economic sustain- ability of new technologies is essential. The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are two measures used in the assessment of health interventions, which, although based on the same theoretical concept, differ in a number of important aspects. DALY can overcome the limit of using arbitrary economic threshold values since it is a benchmark directly comparable with the GDP per capita, an unbiased measure of sustainability. Indeed, in 2002 the World Health Organization (WHO) suggested that interventions costing less than 3 times the per-capita GDP per DALY averted could be considered cost effective. The Expected Value of Information and an estimate of the contribution to GDP (social costs due to presenteeism and absenteeism), along with Health Technology Assessment-based disinvestment decisions and the generation of a comprehensive health dataset (to be analysed using artificial intelligence) should be implemented. These procedures may improve the effectiveness of health governance and lead to better quality of healthcare services.", "This article presents the results of a training program in emotional intelligence.\nEmotional Intelligence (EI) involves two important competencies: (1) the ability to recognize feelings and emotions in oneself and others, and (2) the ability to use that information to resolve conflicts and problems to improve interactions with others. We provided a 30-hour Training Course on Emotional Intelligence (TCEI) for 54 senior managers of a private company. A pretest-posttest design with a control group was adopted.\nEI assessed using mixed and ability-based measures can be improved after training.\nThe study's results revealed that EI can be improved within business environments. Results and implications of including EI training in professional development plans for private organizations are discussed.", "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to drug discovery has become a hot topic in recent years. Generative molecular design based on deep learning is a particular an area of attention. Zhavoronkov et\u00a0al. recently published a novel approach in which de novo molecular design based on deep learning was used to discover novel potent DDR1 kinase inhibitors. It took 21\u00a0days from model building to compound design, and a total of six AI-designed compounds were synthesized and tested. The study highlights how quickly the field of AI-designed compounds is developing, and we can expect further developments in the coming years.", "Background: This study compares the self-concept of students that have motor disabilities with that of students in the normative group. It also considers whether there are EI (emotional intelligence) profiles based on combinations of EI components (attention, clarity, and mood repair). Finally, it analyzes whether there are statistically significant differences in self-concept based on the EI profiles found. Method: 102 university students with motor disabilities participated. The age range was 19-33 (M = 20.22, SD = 4.36). The Escala de Autoconcepto Forma 5 (Self-Concept Scale Form 5, AF5) and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24) were administered. Results: The scores for self-concept were lower in the sample of students with reduced mobility. The cluster analysis also identified three different EI profiles: one group of young people with high general EI scores, one group with high scores for clarity and mood repair, and a last group of students with low EI scores. Finally, the ANOVA showed better self-concept in the group with high scores in the three EI dimensions. The results suggest that better self-concept is associated with a high EI profile. Conclusions: It would be interesting to provide programs that consider EI in more depth to strengthen these students' self-concept.", "AI for chemistry: Automated synthesis can now be performed using an artificial intelligence algorithm to propose the synthetic route and a robotic microfluidic platform to execute the synthesis. This Highlight describes this approach towards small-molecule synthesis and reflects on the significance of this milestone in chemistry.", "Current artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has high performance, particularly in diagnostic and prognostic image analysis, but, in everyday clinical practice, evidence-based results of AI remain limited. In this forum, are analyzed the characteristics of clinical intelligence in medical practice, then the successes and promises of AI, as well as the limitations, reservations and criticisms brought to the introduction of AI in the front-line clinic. The importance of certain ethical and regulatory aspects is highlighted, including a \"human guarantee\" for AI, as suggested by the \"Comit\u00e9 consultatif national d'\u00e9thique pour les sciences de la vie et de la sant\u00e9\" (National advisory committee on ethics for life and health sciences). Clinical intelligence could be this \"human guarantee\" of AI in medicine, and their complementarity could lead to a quality of decisions and, ultimately, of care, far higher than that provided, separately, by each of them.\nIntelligence clinique et intelligence artificielle - Une question de nuance.\nL\u2019intelligence artificielle (IA) actuelle en m\u00e9decine peut se pr\u00e9valoir de grandes performances, particuli\u00e8rement en analyse d\u2019images \u00e0 vis\u00e9es diagnostique et pronostique, mais, en pratique clinique quotidienne, les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019IA fond\u00e9s sur des donn\u00e9es probantes restent peu nombreux.

Caris Molecular Intelligence (CMI) is a multiplatform tumor profiling service that is comprehensive of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA and RNA, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridisation (FISH). The aim of this study is to compare costs of CMI-guided treatment with prior or planned treatment options in correlation with outcome results.\nRetrospective data from five clinical trials were collected to define the treatment decision prior to the receipt of the CMI report (n\u2009=\u2009137 patients). A systematic review of treatment data from 11 clinical studies of CMI (n\u2009=\u2009385 patients) allowed a comparison of planned vs actual (n\u2009=\u2009137) and prior vs actual (n\u2009=\u2009229) treatment costs.\nTreatment plan was changed in 88% of CMI-profiled cases. The actual CMI guided treatment cost per cycle was \u00a3995 in 385 treated patients. Planned treatment costs were comparable to actual treatment costs (\u00a3979 vs \u00a3945; p\u2009=\u20090.7123) and prior treatment costs were not significantly different to profiling-guided treatments (\u00a3892 vs \u00a3850; p\u2009=\u20090.631).\nCaris Molecular Intelligence guided treatment cost per cycle was in the range of prior or planned treatment cost/cycle. Due to beneficial overall survival the additional cost of performing CMI's multiplatform testing to the treatment costs seems to be cost-effective.", "Caffeine is the most widely used drug by both adults and children worldwide due to its ability to promote alertness and elevate moods. It is effective in the management of apnea of prematurity in premature infants. Caffeine for apnea of prematurity reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very-low-birth-weight infants and improves survival without neurodevelopmental disability at 18-21 months. Follow-up studies of the infants in the Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity trial highlight the long-term safety of caffeine in these infants, especially relating to motor, behavioral, and intelligence skills. However, in animal models, exposure to caffeine during pregnancy and lactation adversely affects neuronal development and adult behavior of their offspring. Prenatal caffeine predisposes to intrauterine growth restriction and small growth for gestational age at birth. However, in-utero exposure to caffeine is also associated with excess growth, obesity, and cardio-metabolic changes in children. Caffeine therapy is a significant advance in newborn care, conferring immediate benefits in preterm neonates. Studies should help define the appropriate therapeutic window for caffeine treatment along with with the mechanisms relating to its beneficial effects on the brain and the lung. The long-term consequences of caffeine in adults born preterm are being studied and may depend on the ability of caffeine to modulate both the expression and the maturation of adenosine receptors in infants treated with caffeine.", "Given the positive influence of emotional intelligence (EI) on sports performance, particular attention should be paid on how to improve it. Following promising results, previous research concluding that it was possible to improve EI via specific training programs also raised considerable debates. Indeed, previous EI training programs were very time-consuming for participants. This lessens consequently their suitability with the schedule constraints of elite sport. While, in the absence of sport psychologists, numerous coaches or physiologists try to work with players to improve their emotional competences, the aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of EI training programs fitting the schedule constraints of elite team sports, provided by three different EI trainers: the team's coach, the team's physiotherapist, and an expert in sport psychology. Young elite rugby union players (N = 96) participated in this study. Based on schedule constraints imposed by the head coach of the French u18 rugby union national team, the program consisted in three 1 h group-based EI training sessions occurring the last 3 days before a game (1 per day). Linear mixed-effects models showed that despite the constraining organizational challenge imposed by the coach, the intervention helped the players to increase some emotional competences at the trait level. Furthermore, a pairwise analysis showed that the type of emotional competencies developed depended on the status of the EI trainers. These findings highlight the suitability of a group-based approach in the training-week structure. They also point the way to EI improvement in a short period of time. Moreover, the specific influences of the EI trainer's status on players' EI development invite coaches and researchers to jointly combine their efforts in order to increase the EI training opportunities and to maximize the effects of their interventions. Together, these preliminary results provide first evidence facilitating the integration of such work in the preparation periods during international seasons.", "In this article, we explore the evidence around the relative benefits and harms of breast cancer screening using a single radiologist to examine each female's mammograms for signs of cancer (single reading), or two radiologists (double reading). First, we briefly explore the historical evidence using film-screen mammography, before providing an in-depth description of evidence using digital mammography. We classify studies according to which exact version of double reading they use, because the evidence suggests that effectiveness of double reading is contingent on whether the two radiologists are blinded to one another's decisions, and how the decisions of the two radiologists are integrated. Finally, we explore the implications for future mammography, including using artificial intelligence as the second reader, and applications to more complex three-dimensional imaging techniques such as tomosynthesis.", "Pharmaceutical industry and the art and science of drug development are sorely in need of novel transformative technologies in the current age of digital health and artificial intelligence (AI). Often described as game-changing technologies, AI and machine learning algorithms have slowly but surely begun to revolutionize pharmaceutical industry and drug development over the past 5 years. In this expert review, we describe the most frequently used machine learning algorithms in drug development pipelines and the -omics databases well poised to support machine learning and drug discovery. Subsequently, we analyze the emerging new computational approaches to drug discovery and the in silico pipelines for drug repositioning and the synergies among -omics system sciences, AI and machine learning. As with system sciences, AI and machine learning embody a system scale and Big Data driven vision for drug discovery and development. We conclude with a future outlook on the ways in which machine learning approaches can be implemented to buttress and expedite drug discovery and precision medicine. As AI and machine learning are rapidly entering pharmaceutical industry and the art and science of drug development, we need to critically examine the attendant prospects and challenges to benefit patients and public health.", "In a society where mobility, globalization and contact with people from other cultures have become its distinctive traits, the enhancement of plurilingualism and intercultural understanding should be of the utmost concern. From a positive psychology perspective, agency is the human capacity to affect other people positively or negatively through one's actions. This agentic vision can be related to mediation, a concept rooted in socio-cultural learning theory, where social interaction is considered a fundamental cornerstone in the development of cognition. These social interactions in the language learning setting may be facilitated through musical activities due to their social bonding effect. This paper tries to offer insights into how a music-mediated experience in language learning may develop students' interpersonal and collaborative competences to become active members of a more inclusive society. Mediation, considered to be a paradigm shift in the foreign language classroom and for different out-of-class language learning possibilities, could also provide an environment where learners maximize their emotional intelligence. Our paper focuses on this paradigm shift spearheaded by the Common European Framework for Languages Companion Volume (CEFR/CV) and the considerable repercussions it is bound to have for foreign language didactics, as cooperative tasks become central to foreign language learning. We hypothesize that mediated language learning experiences (MeLLEs) imply a socio-emotional change in learners, focusing on the others, on their needs and interests, by trying to help them understand texts, concepts or facilitating communication with their peers. An intervention with a music-MeLLE was designed and implemented in an L2 classroom of adult learners with divergent backgrounds. A self-assessment scale with mediation descriptors and the socio-emotional expertise scale (SEE) were administered. Results show that students become more mindful of their strengths, and of their capacity for collaboration and teamwork. This leads to more awareness of their mediation skills. Students' mediation skills correlate significantly with their socio-emotional skills - specifically with their expressivity. The implementation of a music-mediated experience also promoted tolerance and enhanced learners' intrinsic motivations for language learning at the same time as acknowledging their diversity.", "This paper discusses the problem of responsibility attribution raised by the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. It is assumed that only humans can be responsible agents; yet this alone already raises many issues, which are discussed starting from two Aristotelian conditions for responsibility. Next to the well-known problem of many hands, the issue of \"many things\" is identified and the temporal dimension is emphasized when it comes to the control condition. Special attention is given to the epistemic condition, which draws attention to the issues of transparency and explainability. In contrast to standard discussions, however, it is then argued that this knowledge problem regarding agents of responsibility is linked to the other side of the responsibility relation: the addressees or \"patients\" of responsibility, who may demand reasons for actions and decisions made by using AI. Inspired by a relational approach, responsibility as answerability thus offers an important additional, if not primary, justification for explainability based, not on agency, but on patiency.", "Current models for patient risk prediction rely on practitioner expertise and domain knowledge. This study presents a deep learning model-a type of machine learning that does not require human inputs-to analyze complex clinical and financial data for population risk stratification.\nA comparative predictive analysis of deep learning versus other popular risk prediction modeling strategies using medical claims data from a cohort of 112,641 pediatric accountable care organization members.\n\"Skip-Gram,\" an unsupervised deep learning approach that uses neural networks for prediction modeling, used data from 2014 and 2015 to predict the risk of hospitalization in 2016. The area under the curve (AUC) of the deep learning model was compared with that of both the Clinical Classifications Software and the commercial DxCG Intelligence predictive risk models, each with and without demographic and utilization features. We then calculated costs for patients in the top 1% and 5% of hospitalization risk identified by each model.\nThe deep learning model performed the best across 6 predictive models, with an AUC of 75.1%. The top 1% of members selected by the deep learning model had a combined healthcare cost $5 million higher than that of the group identified by the DxCG Intelligence model.\nThe deep learning model outperforms the traditional risk models in prospective hospitalization prediction. Thus, deep learning may improve the ability of managed care organizations to perform predictive modeling of financial risk, in addition to improving the accuracy of risk stratification for population health management activities.", "Hispanic individuals are at greater risk for health disparities, less than optimal health care, and are diagnosed at later stages of cognitive impairment than white non-Hispanics. Acculturation and different attitudes toward test-taking may result in decrements in performance, especially on unfamiliar measures that emphasize speed and accuracy. Non-Hispanic individuals often outperform Hispanic individuals on cognitive and neuropsychological measures in community and clinical populations. Current neuropsychological testing may not provide accurate data related to monolingual and bilingual individuals of Hispanic descent. Testing instruments were identified by searching academic databases using combinations of relevant search terms. Neuropsychological instruments were included if they were designed to detect cognitive impairment, had an administration time of less than 45 minutes, and were available in English. Validity studies were required to employ gold standard comparison diagnostic criteria. Twenty-nine instruments were evaluated in dementia staging, global cognition, memory, memory and visual abilities, working memory and attention, verbal learning and memory, recall, language, premorbid intelligence, literacy/cognitive reserve, visuospatial, attention, problem-solving, problem solving and perception, functional assessment, and mood/daily functioning domains. Spanish-language neuropsychological instruments need to be made widely available and existing instruments to be normed in Spanish to best serve and assess diverse populations. Psychometric data were reported for neuropsychological instruments, which may be administered to Hispanic older adults presenting for evaluation related to dementia-spectrum disorders. This is one of the few reviews to provide an overview of the sensitivity and specificity of available Spanish translated neuropsychological instruments.", "Innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) are driving a new industrial revolution, and as a result, the medical radiation sciences is experiencing transformational, open, beneficial, yet disruptive changes. Many studies have already been published on specific frontline examples where AI will improve cancer care, but discussions of how AI will change the medical radiation sciences and its associated professions at the systems level have been comparatively sparse. In this article, the system-level implications of AI on the medical radiation sciences are discussed, and recommendations are made on how professionals in this field may need to adapt in preparation for a future where AI will be an integral part of the health care system at all levels.", "The objective of this study was to assess whether a version of the Smoke Free app with a supportive chatbot powered by artificial intelligence (versus a version without the chatbot) led to increased engagement and short-term quit success.\nDaily or non-daily smokers aged \u226518 years who purchased the 'pro' version of the app and set a quit date were randomly assigned (unequal allocation) to receive the app with or without the chatbot. The outcomes were engagement (i.e. total number of logins over the study period) and self-reported abstinence at a one-month follow-up. Unadjusted and adjusted negative binomial and logistic regression models were fitted to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and odds ratios (ORs) for the associations of interest.\nA total of 57,214 smokers were included (intervention: 9.3% (5339); control: 90.7% (51,875). The app with the chatbot compared with the standard version led to a 101% increase in engagement (IRRadj\u2009=\u20092.01, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20091.92-2.11, p\u2009<\u2009.001). The one-month follow-up rate was 10.6% (intervention: 19.9% (1,061/5,339); control: 9.7% (5,050/51,875). Smokers allocated to the intervention had greater odds of quit success (missing equals smoking: 844/5,339 vs. 3,704/51,875, ORadj\u2009=\u20092.38, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.19-2.58, p\u2009<\u2009.001; follow-up only: 844/1,061 vs. 3,704/5,050, ORadj\u2009=\u20091.36, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.16-1.61, p\u2009<\u2009.001).\nThe addition of a supportive chatbot to a popular smoking cessation app more than doubled user engagement. In view of very low follow-up rates, there is low quality evidence that the addition also increased self-reported smoking cessation.", "Many older adults wish to age in place, and voice-controlled intelligent personal assistants (VIPAs; eg, Amazon Echo and Google Home) potentially could support unmet home needs. No prior studies have researched the real-world use of VIPAs among older adults. We sought to explore how older adults and caregivers utilize VIPAs.\nRetrospective review of all verified purchase reviews of the Amazon Echo posted on Amazon.com between January 2015 and January 2018, with filtering for health-related older adult key words. Open-ended reviews were qualitatively analyzed to identify relevant themes.\nOn retrieval, there were 73 549 reviews; and with subsequent key word filtering, 125 total reviews were subsequently analyzed. Five major themes were identified: (1) entertainment (\"For two very senior citizens\u2026we have really had fun with Echo. She tells us jokes, answers questions, plays music.); (2) companionship (\"A senior living alone\u2026I now have Alex to talk to.\"); (3) home control; (4) reminders (\"I needed something that would provide me with information I couldn't remember well, such as the date, day, or my schedule\u2026I highly recommend for anyone with memory challenges\"); and (5) emergency communication. Several felt it reduced burdening caregivers. \"\u2026You also feel guilt from fear of overburdening your caregivers. Alexa has alleviated much of this.\" Specifically, caregivers found that: \"By making playlists of songs from her youth whoever is providing care, family or professional caregiver, can simply request the right song for the moment in order to sooth, redirect, or distract Mom.\" Alternatively, negative reviewers felt the VIPA misunderstood them or could not adequately respond to specific health questions.\nVIPAs are a low-cost artificial intelligence that can support older adults in the home and potentially reduce caregiver burden. This study is the first to explore VIPA use among older adults, and further studies are needed to examine the direct benefits of VIPAs in supporting aging in place.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning algorithms have started being used to an increasing extent in disease diagnosis due to the high level of efficiency, objectivity, and accuracy that they offer.\nData samples on 192 patients with TPE, 54 patients with parapneumonic pleural effusion (PPE), and 197 patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) were retrospectively collected. Based on 28 different features obtained via statistical analysis, TPE diagnostic models using four machine learning algorithms (MLAs), namely logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) were established and their respective diagnostic performances were calculated. The respective diagnostic performances of each of the four algorithmic models were compared with that of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase (pfADA). Based on 12 features with the most significant impacts on the accuracy of the RF model, a new RF model was designed for clinical application. To demonstrate its external validity, a prospective study was conducted and the diagnostic performance of the RF model was calculated.\nThe respective sensitivity and specificity of each of the four TPE diagnostic models were as follows: logistic regression - 80.5 and 84.8%; KNN- 78.6 and 86.6%; SVM - 83.2 and 85.9%; and RF - 89.1 and 93.6%. The sensitivity and specificity of pfADA were 85.4 and 84.1%, respectively, at the best cut-off value of 17.5\u2009U/L. RF was the superior method among the four MLAs, and was also superior to pfADA. The newly designed RF model (based on 12 out of 28 features) exhibited an acceptable performance rate for the diagnosis of TPE with a sensitivity and specificity of 90.6 and 92.3%, respectively. In the prospective study, its sensitivity and specificity were 100.0 and 90.0%, respectively.\nEstablishing a model for the diagnosis of TPE using RF resulted in a more effective, economical, and faster diagnostic method. This method could enable clinicians to diagnose and treat TPE more effectively.", "Microtubules (MTs) are highly dynamic polymers distributed in the cytoplasm of a biological cell. Alpha and beta globular proteins constituting the heterodimer building blocks combine to form these tubules through polymerization, controlled by the concentration of Guanosine-triphosphate (GTPs) and other Microtubule Associated Proteins (MAPs). MTs play a crucial role in many intracellular processes, predominantly in mitosis, organelle transport and cell locomotion. Current research in this area is focused on understanding the exclusive behaviors of self-organization and their association with different MAPs through organized laboratory experiments. However, the intriguing intelligence behind these tiny machines resulting in complex self-organizing structures is mostly unexplored. In this study, we propose a novel swarm engineering framework in modeling rules for these systems, by combining the principles of design with swarm intelligence. The proposed framework was simulated on a game engine and these simulations demonstrated self-organization of rings and protofilaments in MTs. Analytics from these simulations assisted in understanding the influence of GTPs on protofilament formation. Also, results showed that the population density of GTPs rather than their bonding probabilities played a crucial role in polymerization in forming microtubule substructures.", "Toxicologic pathology is transitioning from analog to digital methods. This transition seems inevitable due to a host of ongoing social and medical technological forces. Of these, artificial intelligence (AI) and in particular machine learning (ML) are globally disruptive, rapidly growing sectors of technology whose impact on the long-established field of histopathology is quickly being realized. The development of increasing numbers of algorithms, peering ever deeper into the histopathological space, has demonstrated to the scientific community that AI pathology platforms are now poised to truly impact the future of precision and personalized medicine. However, as with all great technological advances, there are implementation and adoption challenges. This review aims to define common and relevant AI and ML terminology, describe data generation and interpretation, outline current and potential future business cases, discuss validation and regulatory hurdles, and most importantly, propose how overcoming the challenges of this burgeoning technology may shape toxicologic pathology for years to come, enabling pathologists to contribute even more effectively to answering scientific questions and solving global health issues.

This analysis aimed to identify the association between exercise intolerance and neurocognitive impairments in ALL survivors.\nCardiopulmonary exercise testing, results from a 2-hour standardized neuropsychological assessment, and self-report questionnaires were obtained for 341 adult survivors of childhood ALL and 288 controls. Multivariable modeling was used to test associations between oxygen uptake at 85% estimated heart rate (rpkVO2 ) and neuropsychological test and self-reported questionnaire domains, adjusted for sex, age at diagnosis, cranial radiation, anthracycline, and methotrexate exposure and tobacco smoking status.\nCompared with controls, survivors had worse rpkVO2 and performance on verbal intelligence, focused attention, verbal fluency, working memory, dominant/nondominant motor speed, visual-motor speed, memory span, and reading and math measures (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In adjusted models, exercise intolerance was associated with decreases in performance of verbal ability, focused attention, verbal fluency, working memory, dominant motor speed, nondominant motor speed, visual-motor speed, memory span, reading academics, and math academics in survivors.\nThis study demonstrates an association between exercise intolerance and neurocognitive outcomes. Research is needed to determine whether interventions that improve exercise tolerance impact neurocognitive function in ALL survivors.", "Morningness-eveningness, or chronotype, reflects the timing of sleep-wake patterns across a 24-hour day. Extant research has revealed that chronotype correlates with numerous psychological constructs including cognitive ability. In the current research, we examined how people with different chronotypes perceive their intelligence. We expected eveningness to be positively associated with subjectively assessed intelligence (SAI) because evening chronotypes demonstrate slightly higher intelligence than morning individuals. Furthermore, we considered personality traits (Big Five and narcissism) and objective intelligence (measured with standardized tests of fluid and verbal IQ) as potential variables that could account for this relationship. Across two studies (N =\u00a0504 and 232), we found that eveningness was associated with higher SAI. This relationship remained significant even after controlling for objective intelligence. In Study 1, we also found that when conscientiousness and neuroticism were analyzed together with chronotype, the magnitude of positive association between eveningness and SAI increased. Furthermore, Study 2 revealed that evening individuals exhibited higher narcissism, which fully accounted for their intelligence self-views. In the discussion, we speculate that daily struggles of evening chronotypes to function in morning-oriented society give them a basis to think positively about their intelligence to the extent of positive bias.", "In a prospective cohort design, we investigated: i) diagnostic stability of initially antipsychotic-na\u00efve schizophrenia patients, ii) symptom severity including symptomatic remission, and iii) functional remission including full recovery.\nWe included 143 antipsychotic-na\u00efve patients with first-episode schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. After 4-18 years, we clinically re-evaluated diagnosis, symptom severity and functioning for 70 patients. From the nationwide Danish registers, we extracted pragmatic outcome measures for 142 patients. We examined associations between baseline variables (age at diagnosis, sex, and premorbid intelligence) and long-term outcome status (symptomatic and functional remission).\nAt 4-18 years follow-up, 80% met the criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, however, despite the high diagnostic stability 53% met the criteria of symptomatic and/or functional remission. Symptomatic remission characterized 34% of the patients and was associated with female sex, better premorbid intelligence, and a younger age at schizophrenia diagnosis. Functional remission characterized 41% of the patients and 17% of patients met criteria for full recovery both of which were associated with female sex. The clinically re-evaluated patients did not differ from the drop-outs on key register-based variables.\nWe confirm the emerging evidence of a decreasing long-term diagnostic stability of schizophrenia, and a protective role of female sex. The association between premorbid intelligence and symptomatic remission underscores the pertinence of including cognitive deficits in the diagnostic category of schizophrenia. The association between younger age at diagnosis and symptomatic remission may reflect positive effects of early detection or a drift in the interpretation of the diagnostic classification system.", "Enrollment of large cohorts of syncope patients from administrative data is crucial for proper risk stratification but is limited by the enormous amount of time required for manual revision of medical records.\nTo develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm to automatically identify syncope from Emergency Department (ED) electronic medical records (EMRs).\nDe-identified EMRs of all consecutive patients evaluated at Humanitas Research Hospital ED from 1 December 2013 to 31 March 2014 and from 1 December 2015 to 31 March 2016 were manually annotated to identify syncope. Records were combined in a single dataset and classified. The performance of combined multiple NLP feature selectors and classifiers was tested. Primary Outcomes: NLP algorithms' accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F3 score.\n15,098 and 15,222 records from 2013 and 2015 datasets were analyzed. Syncope was present in 571 records. Normalized Gini Index feature selector combined with Support Vector Machines classifier obtained the best F3 value (84.0%), with 92.2% sensitivity and 47.4% positive predictive value. A 96% analysis time reduction was computed, compared with EMRs manual review.\nThis artificial intelligence algorithm enabled the automatic identification of a large population of syncope patients using EMRs.", "Investments over the past two decades to collect and store immunization events established a national population health data asset. The ability to track vaccine usage and storage has increased accountability, lowered wastage, protected valuable resources, and provided the correct vaccines at the right time. Sixty-four immunization registries support the current immunization ecosystem, yet all investments to date have been through state and federal funding. Much of the technology supporting these registries is becoming harder to support, limiting the utilization of the data. For the most part all current systems have legacy 2nd-generation technology and architectures as their foundation Current technology investments in these national assets tend to be for systems that within the next five years will not be cost effectively sustainable with only federal, state and local funding. Yet quality data is being reported by immunization providers across the health care network that is increasing exponentially through electronic data exchanges integrated within Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Pharmacy Management Systems (PMS) This increase in high-quality patient immunization records creates opportunity to build immunization intelligence from the data. However, 2nd-generation Immunization Information Systems (IIS) limit the effective and timely use of this information. Considering the increasing value of the data to public and private sectors working to close immunization care gaps in populations, supporting technology must ensure easy access This is the first of two papers that highlights the power of these national registries and the data they contain to provide opportunity intelligence to the immunization ecosystem user community. Paper one illustrates the \"why\" for change and the need for a truly community collaborative path forward to move from 2nd- to 3rd-generation systems through partners that leverages cost sharing and common goals The end goal is to establish new supporting technology assets that accelerate the use of data to impact vaccine preventable disease (VPD) outcomes which create a new model for public-private investments to sustain the IIS national infrastructure. The second a working paper with assumptions to be tested (\"Model for Sustaining and Investing in Immunization Information Systems\"), shares cost and investment strategies to complete the migration and create sustainable immunization systems for the future.", "Search and rescue after mass casualty incidents relies on robust data infrastructure. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA's) Task Force 1 (TF1) trains its volunteers to locate and virtually tag scene incidents using a global positioning satellite (GPS) device programmed with markers for each incident (Iron Sights). The authors performed a pilot study comparing Iron Sights\u2122 to a Wi-Fi-based real-time incident geolocation and virtual tagging dashboard (Panacea\u2122) in creating a dynamic common operating picture.\nTwenty-nine stations were placed at a predefined scene incident, each featuring a set of varying waypoint markers using standard FEMA/TF1 nomenclature. Two volunteers performed the experiment for both the Iron Sights and Panacea systems, digitally tagging all station waypoints.\nTF1 simulation training field.\nMetrics compared included GPS location precision, marker accuracy, and delay between scene sweep and common operational picture (COP) generation.\nTwo hundred and sixty-one waypoints were digitally tagged after excluding three stations for missing data. The average GPS location difference for all waypoints between Iron Sights and Panacea was 3.65 m. Marker tagging accuracy between Iron Sights and Panacea was equivalent and not statistically different (78.8 percent vs 66.2 percent, respectively, p = 0.11). Waypoints were tagged in 26.59 minutes and 10.55 minutes on average, respectively. Time from scene sweep to virtual COP generation was 7.97 minutes for Iron Sights after complete scene sweep and 37 seconds for Panacea for each waypoint posting in real-time.\nPanacea generated the COP in real-time compared to a delay with Iron Sights while maintaining the same location precision and marker accuracy. This pilot trial successfully demonstrated the ability to provide real-time actionable intelligence to incident commanders during mass casualty search and rescue missions. Larger field trials are recommended to refine the system and broaden its capabilities.", "The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare delivery has not only provided a glimpse into an enhanced digital future but also raised significant concerns about the social and ethical implications of this evolution. Nursing leaders have a critical role to play in advocating for the just and effective use of AI health solutions. To fulfill this responsibility, nurses need information on the widespread reach of AI and, perhaps more importantly, how the development, deployment and evaluation of these technologies can be influenced.", "The integration of machine learning techniques and metaheuristic algorithms is an area of interest due to the great potential for applications. In particular, using these hybrid techniques to solve combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) to improve the quality of the solutions and convergence times is of great interest in operations research. In this article, the db-scan unsupervised learning technique is explored with the goal of using it in the binarization process of continuous swarm intelligence metaheuristic algorithms. The contribution of the db-scan operator to the binarization process is analyzed systematically through the design of random operators. Additionally, the behavior of this algorithm is studied and compared with other binarization methods based on clusters and transfer functions (TFs). To verify the results, the well-known set covering problem is addressed, and a real-world problem is solved. The results show that the integration of the db-scan technique produces consistently better results in terms of computation time and quality of the solutions when compared with TFs and random operators. Furthermore, when it is compared with other clustering techniques, we see that it achieves significantly improved convergence times.", "We describe the construction and theoretical analysis of a framework derived from canonical neurophysiological principles that model the competing dynamics of incident signals into nodes along directed edges in a network. The framework describes the dynamics between the offset in the latencies of propagating signals, which reflect the geometry of the edges and conduction velocities, and the internal refractory dynamics and processing times of the downstream node receiving the signals. This framework naturally extends to the construction of a perceptron model that takes into account such dynamic geometric considerations. We first describe the model in detail, culminating with the model of a geometric dynamic perceptron. We then derive upper and lower bounds for a notion of optimal efficient signaling between vertex pairs based on the structure of the framework. Efficient signaling in the context of the framework we develop here means that there needs to be a temporal match between the arrival time of the signals relative to how quickly nodes can internally process signals. These bounds reflect numerical constraints on the compensation of the timing of signaling events of upstream nodes attempting to activate downstream nodes they connect into that preserve this notion of efficiency. When a mismatch between signal arrival times and the internal states of activated nodes occurs, it can cause a breakdown in the signaling dynamics of the network. In contrast to essentially all of the current state of the art in machine learning, this work provides a theoretical foundation for machine learning and intelligence architectures based on the timing of node activations and their abilities to respond rather than necessary changes in synaptic weights. At the same time, the theoretical ideas we developed are guiding the discovery of experimentally testable new structure-function principles in the biological brain.", "To evaluate the impact of generalized quasiperiodic epileptiform discharges (\"hurdles\") observed in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep on cognitive function in children with intractable focal epilepsy. \"Hurdles\" pattern does not meet the criteria of the electrical status epilepticus in slow-wave sleep (ESES).\nIn a retrospective analysis, 24 patients with \"hurdles\" and their 24 peers matched for demographic and epilepsy-related variables were compared in terms of neuropsychological domains and electroencephalography (EEG)-derived quantifiers. Both \"hurdles\" and controls were children between 2 and 19\u00a0years of age who had intractable focal epilepsy evaluated as candidates of resective epilepsy surgery.\nFull-scale intelligence quotient/developmental quotient (FSIQ/DQ) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and visuoconstructional skills (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) were significantly lower in children with \"hurdles\" compared to controls. Patients with \"hurdles\" presented with higher interictal spike indexes in sleep (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001, median difference -0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.4, -0.6) and wakefulness (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001, median difference -0.3, 95% CI -0.5, -1). Relative time of sleep spindles in NREM sleep was significantly reduced (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001, median difference 0.1, 95% CI 0.0, 0.1) in the \"hurdles\" group. The time proportion of sleep spindles represented a significant positive (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and spike index of generalized spikes in sleep a significant negative explanatory variable (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) of FSIQ/DQ scores. The proportion of seizure-free patients 2 years after epilepsy surgery did not differ significantly between the two groups (P\u00a0=\u00a0.19).\nAlthough the \"hurdles\" pattern does not fulfill the criteria of ESES, it is associated with a pronounced cognitive dysfunction. Disturbed sleep structure marked by reduced sleep spindles and generalized spiking in sleep is associated with worse cognitive performance. Despite having a generalized nature, we did not find a lower probability of postsurgical seizure freedom in patients with \"hurdles\" pattern.", "There is intense interest and speculation in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to radiology. The goals of this investigation were (1) to assess thoracic radiologists' perspectives on the role and expected impact of AI in radiology, and (2) to compare radiologists' perspectives with those of computer science (CS) experts working in the AI development.\nAn online survey was developed and distributed to chest radiologists and CS experts at leading academic centers and societies, comparing their expectations of AI's influence on radiologists' jobs, job satisfaction, salary, and role in society.\nA total of 95 radiologists and 45 computer scientists responded. Computer scientists reported having read more scientific journal articles on AI/machine learning in the past year than radiologists (mean [95% confidence interval]=17.1 [9.01-25.2] vs. 7.3 [4.7-9.9], P=0.0047). The impact of AI in radiology is expected to be high, with 57.8% and 73.3% of computer scientists and 31.6% and 61.1% of chest radiologists predicting radiologists' job will be dramatically different in 5 to 10 years, and 10 to 20 years, respectively. Although very few practitioners in both fields expect radiologists to become obsolete, with 0% expecting radiologist obsolescence in 5 years, in the long run, significantly more computer scientists (15.6%) predict radiologist obsolescence in 10 to 20 years, as compared with 3.2% of radiologists reporting the same (P=0.0128). Overall, both chest radiologists and computer scientists are optimistic about the future of AI in radiology, with large majorities expecting radiologists' job satisfaction to increase or stay the same (89.5% of radiologists vs. 86.7% of CS experts, P=0.7767), radiologists' salaries to increase or stay the same (83.2% of radiologists vs. 73.4% of CS experts, P=0.1827), and the role of radiologists in society to improve or stay the same (88.4% vs. 86.7%, P=0.7857).\nThoracic radiologists and CS experts are generally positive on the impact of AI in radiology. However, a larger percentage, but still small minority, of computer scientists predict radiologist obsolescence in 10 to 20 years. As the future of AI in radiology unfolds, this study presents a historical timestamp of which group of experts' perceptions were closer to eventual reality.", "Although it is well known that adolescent delinquent behavior is related to poor outcomes in adulthood, longitudinal research on specific acts of delinquency and their interplay with important individual characteristics in predicting future outcomes is scarce. We aimed to examine how physical fighting-one of the most common acts of violent delinquency among adolescent boys-is related to adult life success in several domains, and how intelligence influences these associations. The study used data from 1,083 boys that participated in the population-based longitudinal Young in Norway Study, following adolescents from 1992 to 2015, by combining self-reports at four time points with comprehensive information from registers. Results showed that adolescent boys' physical fighting was associated with poor adult outcomes in the domains of employment, education, and criminal behavior. Associations remained significant even after controlling for conduct problems in general-which isolated the effects of fighting from other delinquent acts-as well as from a variety of other potential confounders. Detailed analyses on the interplay of physical fighting and intelligence showed that some parts of the associations between adolescent boys' fighting and several adverse adult outcomes could be ascribed to lower intelligence among the fighters. Moreover, intelligence moderated the relationship between physical fighting and adult education. Adolescent fighting was not related to educational attainment among boys with high intelligence, whereas boys with lower intelligence experienced detrimental effects of adolescent fighting. The analyses show the importance of considering adolescent boys' physical fighting as a potential risk factor for future social marginalization.", "There is currently no other hot topic like the ability of current technology to develop capabilities similar to those of human beings, even in medicine. This ability to simulate the processes of human intelligence with computer systems is known as artificial intelligence (AI). This article aims to clarify the various terms that still sound foreign to us, such as AI, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and big data. It also provides an in-depth description of the concept of AI and its types; the learning techniques and technology used by ML; cardiac imaging analysis with DL; and the contribution of this technological revolution to classical statistics, as well as its current limitations, legal aspects, and initial applications in cardiology. To do this, we conducted a detailed PubMed search on the evolution of original contributions on AI to the various areas of application in cardiology in the last 5 years and identified 673 research articles. We provide 19 detailed examples from distinct areas of cardiology that, by using AI, have shown diagnostic and therapeutic improvements, and which will aid understanding of ML and DL methodology.", "Empathy and emotional intelligence (EI) of a dentist are two factors vital for developing fruitful relations between clinicians and patients. Establishing a good relationship with patients may improve patients' outcomes. Data on empathy and EI in dental practitioners in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is scarce.\nHence, we aimed to evaluate and compare empathy and EI among dental practitioners in Abha and Khamis Mushayat cities of Saudi Arabia.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional survey study. A total of 183 dental practitioners who were reachable at survey time were included. A self-administered questionnaire on empathy and EI was structured based on Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (health professions version) and Schutte's Emotional Intelligence Scale, respectively. Statistical analysis was done using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests.\nNo significant difference was observed between both genders regarding empathy and EI (P = 0.73 and 0.97, respectively). Similarly, no significant difference was observed between participants with different qualifications or different work settings (P > 0.05). However, a statistically significant positive correlation was observed between empathy and EI (r = 0.722).\nIrrespective of gender, qualification, or different work settings, dental practitioners in both cities showed adequate empathy and EI levels. Dentists with high empathy scores seem to show high EI levels.\nEvaluating and monitoring empathy and EI practice among dental practitioners have paramount importance to improve clinical practice and healing potential of patients. Low levels of empathy and EI practice would suggest modifications to training curriculum or healthcare policies.", "The Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors are becoming increasingly popular, especially in monitoring large and ambient environments. Applications that embrace IoT and sensors often require mining the data feeds that are collected at frequent intervals for intelligence. Despite the fact that such sensor data are massive, most of the data contents are identical and repetitive; for example, human traffic in a park at night. Most of the traditional classification algorithms were originally formulated decades ago, and they were not designed to handle such sensor data effectively. Hence, the performance of the learned model is often poor because of the small granularity in classification and the sporadic patterns in the data. To improve the quality of data mining from the IoT data, a new pre-processing methodology based on subspace similarity detection is proposed. Our method can be well integrated with traditional data mining algorithms and anomaly detection methods. The pre-processing method is flexible for handling similar kinds of sensor data that are sporadic in nature that exist in many ambient sensing applications. The proposed methodology is evaluated by extensive experiment with a collection of classical data mining models. An improvement over the precision rate is shown by using the proposed method.", "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease characterized by an unpredictable progressive decline in lung function. Natural history of IPF is unknown and the prediction of disease progression at the time of diagnosis is notoriously difficult. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been used for the diagnosis of IPF, but not generally for monitoring purpose. The objective of this work is to develop a novel predictive model for the radiological progression pattern at voxel-wise level using only baseline HRCT scans. Mainly, there are two challenges: (a) obtaining a data set of features for region of interest (ROI) on baseline HRCT scans and their follow-up status; and (b) simultaneously selecting important features from high-dimensional space, and optimizing the prediction performance. We resolved the first challenge by implementing a study design and having an expert radiologist contour ROIs at baseline scans, depending on its progression status in follow-up visits. For the second challenge, we integrated the feature selection with prediction by developing an algorithm using a wrapper method that combines quantum particle swarm optimization to select a small number of features with random forest to classify early patterns of progression. We applied our proposed algorithm to analyze anonymized HRCT images from 50 IPF subjects from a multi-center clinical trial. We showed that it yields a parsimonious model with 81.8% sensitivity, 82.2% specificity and an overall accuracy rate of 82.1% at the ROI level. These results are superior to other popular feature selections and classification methods, in that our method produces higher accuracy in prediction of progression and more balanced sensitivity and specificity with a smaller number of selected features. Our work is the first approach to show that it is possible to use only baseline HRCT scans to predict progressive ROIs at 6 months to 1year follow-ups using artificial intelligence.", "Saprotrophic cord-forming basidiomycetes, with their mycelial networks at the soil/litter interface on the forest floor, play a major role in wood decomposition and nutrient cycling/relocation. Many studies have investigated foraging behaviour of their mycelium, but there is little information on their intelligence. Here, we investigate the effects of relative size of inoculum wood and new wood resource (bait) on the decision of a mycelium to remain in, or migrate from, inoculum to bait using Phanerochaete velutina as a model. Experiments allowed mycelium to grow from an inoculum across the surface of a soil microcosm where it encountered a new wood bait. After colonisation of the bait, the original inoculum was moved to a tray of fresh soil to determine whether the fungus was still able to grow out. This also allowed us to test the mycelium's memory of growth direction. When inocula were transferred to new soil, there was regrowth from 67% of the inocula, and a threshold bait size acted as a cue for the mycelium's decision to migrate for a final time, rather than a threshold of relative size of inoculum: bait. There was greater regrowth from the side that originally faced the new bait, implying memory of growth direction.", "Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a direct communicating and controlling approach between the brain and surrounding environment, which attracts a wide range of interest in the fields of brain science and artificial intelligence. It is a core to decode the electroencephalogram (EEG) feature in the BCI system. The decoding efficiency highly depends on the feature extraction and feature classification algorithms. In this paper, we first introduce the commonly-used EEG features in the BCI system. Then we introduce the basic classical algorithms and their advanced versions used in the BCI system. Finally, we present some new BCI algorithms proposed in recent years. We hope this paper can spark fresh thinking for the research and development of high-performance BCI system.\n\u8111-\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\uff08BCI\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u8111\u4e0e\u5916\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6d41\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d7\u5230\u8111\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u8111\u7535\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u7801\u662fBCI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u9ad8\u6548\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u7801\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u201c\u7279\u5f81\u201d\u548c\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7d27\u63a5\u7740\u4ecb\u7ecdBCI\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u3001\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u8111\u7535\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u52a8\u5411\uff0c\u5e0c\u5180\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdBCI\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002.", "Concussion, also referred to as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the most common type of traumatic brain injury. Currently concussion is an area ofintensescientific interest to better understand the biological mechanisms and for biomarker development. We evaluated whole genome-wide blood DNA cytosine ('CpG') methylation in 17 pediatric concussion isolated cases and 18 unaffected controls using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC assay. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to help elucidate the epigenetic and molecular mechanisms of the disorder. Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curves and FDR p-values were calculated for mTBI detection based on CpG methylation levels. Multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms including Deep Learning (DL), the newest form of AI, were used to predict concussion based on i) CpG methylation markers alone, and ii) combined epigenetic, clinical and demographic predictors. We found 449 CpG sites (473 genes), those were statistically significantly methylated in mTBI compared to controls. There were four CpGs with excellent individual accuracy (AUC\u202f\u2265\u202f0.90-1.00) while 119 displayed good accuracy (AUC\u202f\u2265\u202f0.80-0.89) for the prediction of mTBI. The CpG methylation changes \u226510% were observed in many CpG loci after concussion suggesting biological significance. Pathway analysis identified several biologically important neurological pathways that were perturbed including those associated with: impaired brain function, cognition, memory, neurotransmission, intellectual disability and behavioral change and associated disorders. The combination of epigenomic and clinical predictors were highly accurate for the detection of concusion using AI techniques. Using DL/AI, a combination of epigenomic and clinical markers had sensitivity and specificity \u226795% for prediction of mTBI. In this novel study, we identified significant methylation changes in multiple genes in response to mTBI. Gene pathways that were epigenetically dysregulated included several known to be involved in neurological function, thus giving biological plausibility to our findings.", "We investigate opportunities and challenges for improving unsupervised machine learning using four common strategies with a long history in physics: divide and conquer, Occam's razor, unification, and lifelong learning. Instead of using one model to learn everything, we propose a paradigm centered around the learning and manipulation of theories, which parsimoniously predict both aspects of the future (from past observations) and the domain in which these predictions are accurate. Specifically, we propose a generalized mean loss to encourage each theory to specialize in its comparatively advantageous domain, and a differentiable description length objective to downweight bad data and \"snap\" learned theories into simple symbolic formulas. Theories are stored in a \"theory hub,\" which continuously unifies learned theories and can propose theories when encountering new environments. We test our implementation, the toy \"artificial intelligence physicist\" learning agent, on a suite of increasingly complex physics environments. From unsupervised observation of trajectories through worlds involving random combinations of gravity, electromagnetism, harmonic motion, and elastic bounces, our agent typically learns faster and produces mean-squared prediction errors about a billion times smaller than a standard feedforward neural net of comparable complexity, typically recovering integer and rational theory parameters exactly. Our agent successfully identifies domains with different laws of motion also for a nonlinear chaotic double pendulum in a piecewise constant force field.", "Patients with the metabolic disorder classical galactosemia suffer from long-term complications despite a galactose-restricted diet, including a below average intelligence level. The aim of the current review was to investigate the incidence and profile of cognitive impairments in patients with classical galactosemia.\nMEDLINE, EMBASE and PsychINFO were searched up to 23 October 2018 for studies examining information processing speed, attention, memory, language, visuospatial functioning, executive functioning and social cognition in patients with confirmed classical galactosemia utilizing standardized neuropsychological tests. Data synthesis followed a narrative approach, since the planned meta-analysis was not possible due to large variability between the neuropsychological assessments.\nEleven studies were included, including case-studies. The quality of most studies was moderate to low. As a group, patients with classical galactosemia exhibit below average to low scores on all cognitive domains. A large proportion of the patients perform on an impaired level on attention, memory and vocabulary. Evidence for impairments in information processing speed, language, visuospatial functioning and aspects of executive functioning was limited due to the small number of studies investigating these cognitive functions. Social cognition was not examined at all.\nGiven the moderate to low quality of the included studies and the limited evidence in many cognitive domains, the incidence of cognitive impairment in patients with classical galactosemia is not yet clear. Both clinicians and researchers encountering patients with classical galactosemia need to be aware of possible cognitive impairments. Future well-designed studies are needed to determine the cognitive profile of classical galactosemia. This can be the basis for the development of intervention strategies.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for cardiovascular medicine but is limited by a lack of large, heterogeneous and granular data sets. Blockchain provides secure interoperability between siloed stakeholders and centralized data sources. We discuss integration of blockchain with AI for data-centric analysis and information flow, its current limitations and potential cardiovascular applications.", "Background: Software systems using artificial intelligence for medical purposes have been developed in recent years. The success of deep neural networks (DNN) in 2012 in the image recognition challenge ImageNet LSVRC 2010 fueled expectations of the potential for using such systems in dermatology.Objective: To evaluate the ways in which machine learning has been utilized in dermatology to date and provide an overview of the findings in current literature on the subject.Methods: We conducted a systematic review of existing literature, identifying the literature through a systematic search of the PubMed database. Two doctors assessed screening and eligibility with respect to pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria.Results: A total of 2175 publications were identified, and 64 publications were included. We identified eight major categories where machine learning tools were tested in dermatology. Most systems involved image recognition tools that were primarily aimed at binary classification of malignant melanoma (MM). Short system descriptions and results of all included systems are presented in tables.Conclusions: We present a complete overview of artificial intelligence implemented in dermatology. Impressive outcomes were reported in all of the identified eight categories, but head-to-head comparison proved difficult. The many areas of dermatology where we identified machine learning tools indicate the diversity of machine learning.", "Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD) is characterized by progressive short stature that develops by age two years. The clinical and radiographic features are usually not present at birth, but manifest in early childhood with short limbs, genu varum, and waddling gait. Facial features and head size are normal. Radiographs show metaphyseal irregularities of the long bones (e.g., splaying, flaring, cupping); shortening of the tubular bones; widened growth plates; coxa vara; and anterior cupping, sclerosis, and splaying of the ribs. Mild hand involvement often includes shortening of the tubular bones and metaphyseal cupping of the metacarpals and proximal phalanges. Platyspondyly and vertebral end-plate irregularities are less common. Hand and vertebral involvement can resolve with age. Early motor milestones may be delayed due to orthopedic complications. Intelligence is normal. Joint pain in the knees and hips is common and may limit physical activity. Adult height is typically more than 3.5 SD below the mean, although a wide spectrum that overlaps normal height has been reported. There are no extraskeletal manifestations.\nThe diagnosis of SMCD is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic features and/or identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in COL10A1 by molecular genetic testing.\nTreatment of manifestations: Management of orthopedic complications by orthopedist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, and pain specialist as indicated. Joint-friendly exercise, weight management; mobility device as needed; corrective osteotomy by guided growth surgery or valgus osteotomy may be considered in late childhood / adolescence in those with progressive or symptomatic varus deformity, significant coxa vara, triangular fragment in the interior femoral neck, or poor or deteriorating function; exercise and support from nutritionist to maintain healthy weight; psychosocial support; environmental or occupational modifications as needed for short stature with recommendations from occupational therapy as needed. Surveillance: Annual growth assessment, clinical evaluation for orthopedic manifestations, and psychosocial evaluation. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Obesity; physical activities that cause excessive joint strain.\nSMCD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with SMCD have the disorder as the result of a de novo COL10A1 pathogenic variant. Some individuals diagnosed with SMCD have an affected parent. Each child of an individual with SMCD has a 50% chance of inheriting the COL10A1 pathogenic variant. If the proband and the proband's reproductive partner are affected with different dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasias, genetic counseling becomes more complicated because of the risk of inheriting two dominantly inherited bone growth disorders. If the COL10A1 pathogenic variant has been identified in the affected parent, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for SMCD and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.", "In the last ten years, the international workshop on knowledge representation for health care (KR4HC) has hosted outstanding contributions of the artificial intelligence in medicine community pertaining to the formalization and representation of medical knowledge for supporting clinical care. Contributions regarding modeling languages, technologies and methodologies to produce these models, their incorporation into medical decision support systems, and practical applications in concrete medical settings have been the main contributions and the basis to define the evolution of this field across Europe and worldwide.\nCarry out a review of the papers accepted in KR4HC in the 2009-2018 decade, analyze and characterize the topics and trends within this field, and identify challenges for the evolution of the area in the near future.\nWe reviewed the title, the abstract, and the keywords of the 112 papers that were accepted to the workshop, identified the medical and technological topics involved in these works, provided a classification of these papers in medical and technological perspectives and obtained the timeline of these topics in order to determine interest growths and declines. The experience of the authors in the field and the evidences after the review were the basis to propose a list of challenges of knowledge representation in health care for the future.\nThe most generic knowledge representation methods are ontologies (31%), semantic web related formalisms (26%), decision tables and rules (19%), logic (14%), and probabilistic models (10%). From a medical informatics perspective, knowledge is mainly represented as computer interpretable clinical guidelines (43%), medical domain ontologies (26%), and electronic health care records (22%). Within the knowledge lifecycle, contributions are found in knowledge generation (38%), knowledge specification (24%), exception detection and management (12%), knowledge enactment (8%), temporal knowledge and reasoning (7%), and knowledge sharing and maintenance (7%). The clinical emphasis of knowledge is mainly related to clinical treatments (27%), diagnosis (13%), clinical quality indicators (13%), and guideline integration for multimorbid patients (12%). According to the level of development of the works presented, we distinguished four maturity levels: formal (22%), implementation (52%), testing (13%), and deployment (2%) levels. Some papers described technologies for specific clinical issues or diseases, mainly cancer (22%) and diseases of the circulatory system (20%). Chronicity and comorbidity were present in 10% and 8% of the papers, respectively.\nKR4HC is a stable community, still active after ten years. A persistent focus has been knowledge representation, with an emphasis on semantic-web ontologies and on clinical-guideline based decision-support. Among others, two topics receive growing attention: integration of computer-interpretable guideline knowledge for the management of multimorbidity patients, and patient empowerment and patient-centric care.", "The domain of healthcare has always been flooded with a huge amount of complex data, coming in at a very fast-pace. A vast amount of data is generated in different sectors of healthcare industry: data from hospitals and healthcare providers, medical insurance, medical equipment, life sciences and medical research. With the advancement in technology, there is a huge potential for utilization of this data for transforming healthcare. The application of analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence over big data enables identification of patterns and correlations and hence provides actionable insights for improving the delivery of healthcare. There have been many contributions to the literature in this topic, but we lack a comprehensive view of the current state of research and application. This paper focuses on assessing the available literature in order to provide the researchers with evidence that enable fostering further development in this area. A systematic mapping study was conducted to identify and analyze research on big data analytics and artificial intelligence in healthcare, in which 2421 articles between 2013 and February 2019 were evaluated. The results of this study will help understand the needs in application of these technologies in healthcare by identifying the areas that require additional research. It will hence provide the researchers and industry experts with a base for future work.", "Artificial intelligence, as the breakthrough of current information technology, is gaining importance and being applied in more and more industries. Research on the application of artificial intelligence to the medical field has gradually matured and some products have come out. Relevant products in the United States have been approved by the FDA, mainly for image-based software products. In this paper, we studied the cases of image-based artificial intelligence aided diagnosis software approved by the US FDA, and analyzed the listing routes, clinical evaluation methods and clinical data processing of representative artificial intelligence products, and summarized the clinical evaluation characteristics of FDA for image-based artificial intelligence aided diagnosis software. Finally, problems that may be encountered in the clinical evaluation of similar products in China were considered, and relevant suggestions were put forward.", "As the cost of healthcare in the United States increases at an unsustainable rate, health-policy leaders are looking towards innovative ways to maximize value in delivery of care. Incorporating technology, such as artificial intelligence/machine-learning, to assist physicians in decision-making and predicting outcomes, on a real-time basis, is a major topic of discussion. While machine learning is gradually pulling traction in the medical community, it still remains a nascent field in the realm of spine surgery. The current review aims to gather current literature discussing the validity and applicability of machine-learning models in spine surgery.", "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is relatively uncommon, yet it is a deadly consequence of some antipsychotic medications in patients with psychiatric disorders. The widespread concerns about the adverse cardiac effects associated with antipsychotics and their unpredictable nature have led to a restriction on the use of some antipsychotic medications. Recent progress has been made in the identification of important genetic factors that may contribute to the adverse complication of antipsychotic drugs, suggesting that high-risk individuals can be identified prior to initiating therapy. In addition, some high-tech smart wearable medical devices have recently been developed, allowing users to record and analyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) in couple with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and notifying of irregular heart rhythms or arrhythmias, a medical condition well documented in most SCD cases. In this literature review, we summarize recent advances in understanding the link between SCD and antipsychotic drug usage, as well as in utilizing wearable medical devices for monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias. New strategies for improving the care of patients receiving antipsychotic medications are proposed. As it is now possible to evaluate the risk of SCD in patients on antipsychotic medications, preventative measures and close monitoring may be used to detect the early signs of adverse cardiac events and SCD.", "The current study explored whether the three-factor structure of an emotional intelligence measure (attention to emotions, clarity in understanding emotions, and emotion regulation) developed in a sample of college students would replicate in a sample of older adults with chronic pain.\nConfirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were conducted to examine the factor structure of the 30-item Trait Meta-Mood Scale among 340 older adults with knee osteoarthritis.\nConfirmatory factor analyses indicated that the original three-factor model of emotional intelligence did not fit well with the data for older adults. Exploratory factor analyses revealed a four-factor model of emotional intelligence: (1) confusion, (2) acceptance, (3) rejection, and (4) insight. Correlations between the original and new subscales were explored.\nWhile the newly derived emotional intelligence scales resembled the original conceptualization of emotional intelligence proposed by Salovey, Mayer, Goldman, Turvey, and Palfai (1995), the current study highlights the differences in emotional intelligence likely representative of older adults with chronic pain.", "Identification of adverse events and determination of their seriousness ensures timely detection of potential patient safety concerns. Adverse event seriousness is a key factor in defining reporting timelines and is often performed manually by pharmacovigilance experts. The dramatic increase in the volume of safety reports necessitates exploration of scalable solutions that also meet reporting timeline requirements.\nThe aim of this study was to develop an augmented intelligence methodology for automatically identifying adverse event seriousness in spontaneous, solicited, and medical literature safety reports. Deep learning models were evaluated for accuracy and/or the F1 score against a ground truth labeled by pharmacovigilance experts.\nUsing a stratified random sample of safety reports received by Celgene, we developed three neural networks for addressing identification of adverse event seriousness: (1) a binary adverse-event level seriousness classifier; (2) a classifier for determining seriousness categorization at the adverse-event level; and (3) an annotator for identifying seriousness criteria terms to provide supporting evidence at the document level.\nThe seriousness classifier achieved an accuracy of 83.0% in post-marketing reports, 92.9% in solicited reports, and 86.3% in medical literature reports. F1 scores for seriousness categorization were 77.7 for death, 78.9 for hospitalization, and 75.5 for important medical events. The seriousness annotator achieved an F1 score of 89.9 in solicited reports, and 75.2 in medical literature reports.\nThe results of this study indicate that a neural network approach can provide an accurate and scalable solution for potentially augmenting pharmacovigilance practitioner determination of adverse event seriousness in spontaneous, solicited, and medical literature reports.", "Medical education research subjects are incredibly diverse and have changed over time. This work in particular aims to compare and analyze research trends in medical education through the words used in the titles of these research papers. Academic Medicine (the journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges), Medical Teacher (the journal of the Association of Medical Education in Europe), the Korean Journal of Medical Education (KJME), and Korean Medical Education Review (KMER) were selected and analyzed for the purposes of this research. From 2009 to 2018, Academic Medicine and Medical Teacher published approximately 10 to 20 times more papers than the KJME and KMER. Frequently used words in these titles include \"medical,\" \"student,\" \"education,\" and \"learning.\" The words \"clinical\" and \"learning\" were used relatively often (7.80% to 13.66%) in Korean journals and Medical Teacher, but Academic Medicine used these phrases relatively less often (6.47% and 4.41%, respectively). Concern with such various topics as problem-based learning, team-based learning, program evaluations, burnout, e-learning, and digital indicates that Medical Teacher seems to primarily deal with teaching and learning methodologies, and Academic Medicine handles all aspects of medical education. The KJME and KMER did not cover all subjects, as they publish smaller papers. However, it is anticipated that research on new subjects, such as artificial intelligence in medical education, will occur in the near future.", "Since the significance of metacognition as the theoretical basis of a psychological intervention for schizophrenia first emerged, there have been ongoing attempts to restore or strengthen patients' metacognitive abilities.\nA Korean version of the metacognitive training (MCT) program was developed, and its effects on theory of mind, positive and negative symptoms, and interpersonal relationships were examined in stable outpatients with schizophrenia.\nA pre-test-post-test design with a control group was used. The participants were 59 outpatients (30 in experimental group, 29 in control group) registered at five mental health facilities in a city in South Korea. The developed MCT program was applied for a total of 18 sessions, 60 min per session, over a period of 14 weeks. The hinting task, false belief task, Scale for the Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms, and Relationship Change Scale were used to verify the effects of this program. Data were analysed by the chi-square test, t-test, and Mann-Whitney U-test using the SPSS/PASW 18.0 statistics program.\nThe general characteristics, intelligence, and outcome variables of the two groups were homogeneous. After the intervention, the experimental group showed significant improvements in theory of mind, positive and negative symptoms and interpersonal relationships compared with the control group.\nThese results suggest that the MCT program can be a complementary psychotherapy that contributes to symptom relief and interpersonal functioning in patients with schizophrenia, and is effective in the Korean culture, beyond the Western context.", "This project investigates the macroepidemiological aspects of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) RNA detection by veterinary diagnostic laboratories (VDLs) for the period 2007 through 2018. Standardized submission data and PRRSV real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test results from porcine samples were retrieved from four VDLs representing 95% of all swine samples tested in NAHLN laboratories in the US. Anonymized data were retrieved and organized at the case level using SAS (SAS\u00ae Version 9.4, SAS\u00ae Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) with the use of PROC DATA, PROC MERGE, and PROC SQL scripts. The final aggregated and anonymized dataset comprised of 547,873 unique cases was uploaded to Power Business Intelligence-Power BI\u00ae (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) to construct dynamic charts. The number of cases tested for PRRSV doubled from 2010 to 2018, with that increase mainly driven by samples typically used for monitoring purposes rather than diagnosis of disease. Apparent seasonal trends for the frequency of PRRSV detection were consistently observed with a higher percentage of positive cases occurring during fall or winter months and lower during summer months, perhaps due to increased testing associated with well-known seasonal occurrence of swine respiratory disease. PRRSV type 2, also known as North American genotype, accounted for 94.76% of all positive cases and was distributed across the US. PRRSV type 1, also known as European genotype, was geographically restricted and accounted for 2.15% of all positive cases. Co-detection of both strains accounted for 3.09% of the positive cases. Both oral fluid and processing fluid samples, had a rapid increase in the number of submissions soon after they were described in 2008 and 2017, respectively, suggesting rapid adoption of these specimens by the US swine industry for PRRSV monitoring in swine populations. As part of this project, a bio-informatics tool defined as Swine Disease Reporting System (SDRS) was developed. This tool has real-time capability to inform the US swine industry on the macroepidemiological aspects of PRRSV detection, and is easily adaptable for other analytes relevant to the swine industry.", "Cross-sectional study aimed to analyse differences in cognitive performance across fitness components categories (cardiorespiratory fitness [CRF], speed-agility and muscular fitness [MF]) and weight status in children, and to determine whether physical fitness mediates the association between body mass index (BMI) and cognitive performance. Fitness components and BMI were measured using standard procedures in 630 children aged 5-to-7\u00a0years from the provinces of Cuenca and Ciudad Real, Spain. BADyG was used to assess cognitive performance. We used ANCOVA models to test mean differences in cognition scores by BMI and fitness categories. Hayes's PROCESS macro was used for mediation analyses. Children with normal weight scored better in spatial factor and general intelligence than their overweight/obese peers (p <\u00a00.05), but differences were attenuated when controlling for CRF (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Children with better results in CRF and speed-agility scored better in all cognitive dimensions even after controlling for BMI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Similarly, children with high MF obtained better scores in verbal factor (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). All fitness components acted as mediators of the relationship between BMI and general intelligence (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These findings highlight the crucial role of fitness in minimising the negative effect of excess weight on children's cognition.Abbreviations: BMI: Body mass index; CRF: Cardiorespiratory fitness; MF: Muscular fitness; BADyG E1: Battery of general and differential aptitudes; SES: Socioeconomic status; SD: Standard deviation; IE: Indirect effect.", "One of the main goals of dental treatment is to mimic teeth and design smiles in a most natural and aesthetic manner, based on the individual and specific needs of the patient. Possibilities to reach that goal have significantly improved over the last decade through new and specific treatment modalities, steadily enhanced and more aesthetic dental materials, and novel techniques and technologies. This article gives an overview of the evolution of aesthetic dentistry over the past 100 y from a historical point of view and highlights advances in the development of dental research and clinical interventions that have contributed the science and art of aesthetic dentistry. Among the most noteworthy advancements over the past decade are the establishment of universal aesthetic rules and guidelines based on the assessment of natural aesthetic parameters, anatomy, and physiognomy; the development of tooth whitening and advanced restorative as well as prosthetic materials and techniques, supported by the pioneering discovery of dental adhesion; the significant progress in orthodontics and periodontal as well as oral and maxillofacial surgery; and, most recently, the implementation of digital technologies in the 3-dimensional planning and realization of truly natural, individual, and aesthetic smiles. In the future, artificial intelligence and machine learning will likely lead to automation of aesthetic evaluation, smile design, and treatment-planning processes.", "Purpose: To investigate whether a combination of radiomics and automatic machine learning applied to dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of primary breast cancer can non-invasively predict axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis. Methods: 62 patients who received a DCE-MRI breast scan were enrolled. Tumor resection and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy were performed within 1 week after the DCE-MRI examination. According to the time signal intensity curve, the volumes of interest (VOIs) were delineated on the whole tumor in the images with the strongest enhanced phase. Datasets were randomly divided into two sets including a training set (~80%) and a validation set (~20%). A total of 1,409 quantitative imaging features were extracted from each VOI. The select K best and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) were used to obtain the optimal features. Three classification models based on the logistic regression (LR), XGboost, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were constructed. Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis was used to analyze the prediction performance of the models. Both feature selection and models construction were firstly performed in the training set, then were further tested in the validation set by the same thresholds. Results: There is no significant difference between all clinical and pathological variables in breast cancer patients with and without SLN metastasis (P > 0.05), except histological grade (P = 0.03). Six features were obtained as optimal features for models construction. In the validation set, with respect to the accuracy and MSE, the SVM demonstrated the highest performance, with an accuracy, AUC, sensitivity (for positive SLN), specificity (for positive SLN) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.85, 0.83, 0.71, 1, 0.26, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of combining artificial intelligence and radiomics from DCE-MRI of primary tumors to predict axillary SLN metastasis in breast cancer. This non-invasive approach could be very promising in application.", "Almost all of what is known about neurologic and cognitive development in hemophilia derives from the Hemophilia Growth and Development Study, conducted during an era when treatment regimens and comorbidities differed significantly from the current environment. Results suggested hemophilia and human immunodeficiency virus had independent effects, and hemophilia negatively impacts academic achievement, attention, and behavior. The introduction of prophylaxis treatment in hemophilia has created the need for re-evaluation of the effects of hemophilia on neurodevelopment and cognition. We outline the Evolving Treatment of Hemophilia's Impact on Neurodevelopment, Intelligence, and Other Cognitive Functions (NCT03660774) study, which aims to meet this need.", "This expert review offers a critical synthesis of the latest insights and approaches at targeting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway in various cancers such as colorectal cancer, melanoma, leukemia, and breast and lung cancers. Notably, from organogenesis to cancer, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling displays varied and highly versatile biological functions in animals, with virtually all tissues requiring the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in one way or the other. Aberrant expression of the members of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin has been implicated in many pathological conditions, particularly in human cancers. Mutations in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway genes have been noted in diverse cancers. Biochemical and genetic data support the idea that inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is beneficial in cancer therapeutics. The interaction of this important pathway with other signaling systems is also noteworthy, but remains as an area for further research and discovery. In addition, formation of different complexes by components of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and the precise roles of these complexes in the cytoplasmic milieu are yet to be fully elucidated. This article highlights the latest medical technologies in imaging, single-cell omics, use of artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning techniques), genome sequencing, quantum computing, molecular docking, and computational softwares in modeling interactions between molecules and predicting protein-protein and compound-protein interactions pertinent to the biology and therapeutic value of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. We discuss these emerging technologies in relationship to what is currently needed to move from concept to actionable strategies in translating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin laboratory discoveries to Wnt-targeted cancer therapies and diagnostics in the clinic.", "In spite of the observation that nurse managers' style of authority in sub-Saharan Africa is one of antagonistic vibe and lordship, there is not much information on the kind of leadership provided in the hospitals by nurse managers. Following the notion that transformational leadership is a solution to many leadership problems and often creates valuable positive change in followers, this study aims to examine the level of transformational leadership behavior of nurse leaders; determining the effects of the sub-constructs of emotional intelligence (EI) on the transformational leadership behavior of leaders; and determining whether there is a difference in the exhibition of transformational leadership behavior due to the gender of leaders.\nThe study uses five of the major public hospitals in the Greater Accra Region (the capital) of Ghana. Evidence of such links would be considerable for Ghanaian healthcare providers in their quest to find potential nurse leaders to train, so as not to dwell highly on the seniority criterion in the selection of leaders. Using a quantitative approach, the Wong Law EI Scale (2002) and leadership items adapted from Rafferty and Griffin (2004) were used to collect the data. A descriptive statistics (mean) revealed that nurse leaders from the selected hospitals exhibited a high level (M= 3.90, SD\u2009=\u20090.14) of transformational leadership behavior.\nA multiple regression analysis revealed that three of the sub-constructs of EI significantly affected transformational leadership with the \"self-emotion appraisal\" construct having the strongest effect on transformational leadership behavior (\u03b2 = 0.508, p\u2009=\u20090.000). However, the others' emotion appraisal sub-construct did not significantly affect transformational leadership. Furthermore, the results from the independent sample t-test revealed no significant difference in the exhibition of transformational leadership due to gender.\nBased on the findings, when leaders are trained to be emotionally intelligent and their skills are fostered, they are more likely to exhibit transformational leadership behaviors, which will further result in organizational effectiveness and follower satisfaction. Hospitals must focus on the control of one's emotions at work, and subsequently, understanding others' emotions. In developing transformational leaders, there is the need to identify some tools that will increase EI level, more specifically, traits related to the understanding of others' emotion. The findings from this study indicate that one of the factors to check when selecting nurse leaders should be their EI and not necessarily a matter of seniority in many cases in emerging economies.\nThe originality of this study is in the fact that it focuses on an emerging economy, which is under researched. In Ghana, the criteria for promotion of nurse leaders' is based strictly on seniority and age and not on factors such as the leaders EI. The profession of nursing is such that leaders need to understand that certain soft skills such as EI are considered necessary to transform the hospitals and staff they lead. This study, therefore, sheds light on these key areas from the perspective of an emerging economy, which are usually not in the domain of literature in the area of healthcare leadership.", "In materials science, the investigation of a large and complex experimental space is time-consuming and thus may induce bias to exclude potential solutions where little to no knowledge is available. This work presents the development of a highly hydrophobic material from an amphiphilic polymer through a novel, adaptive artificial intelligence approach. The hydrophobicity arises from the random packing of short polymer fibers into paper, a highly entropic, multistep process. Using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm is able to efficiently navigate the parameter space without bias, including areas which a human experimenter would not address. This resulted in additional knowledge gain, which can then be applied to the fabrication process, resulting in a highly hydrophobic material (static water contact angle 135\u00b0) from an amphiphilic polymer (contact angle of 90\u00b0) through a simple and scalable filtration-based method. This presents a potential pathway for surface modification using the short polymer fibers to create fluorine-free hydrophobic surfaces on a larger scale.", "The purpose of this descriptive research paper is to initiate discussions on the use of innovative technologies and their potential to support the research and development of pan-Canadian monitoring and surveillance activities associated with environmental impacts on health and within the health system. Its primary aim is to provide a review of disruptive technologies and their current uses in the environment and in healthcare. Drawing on extensive experience in population-level surveillance through the use of technology, knowledge from prior projects in the field, and conducting a review of the technologies, this paper is meant to serve as the initial steps toward a better understanding of the research area. In doing so, we hope to be able to better assess which technologies might best be leveraged to advance this unique intersection of health and environment. This paper first outlines the current use of technologies at the intersection of public health and the environment, in particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The paper provides a description for each of these technologies, along with a summary of their current applications, and a description of the challenges one might face with adopting them. Thereafter, a high-level reference architecture, that addresses the challenges of the described technologies and could potentially be incorporated into the pan-Canadian surveillance system, is conceived and presented.", "Health care systems worldwide have been influenced by the globally growing trend toward a sharing economy and will likely advance with these trends in the near future. Therefore, based on peer-to-peer relationships between individuals, sharing health care works by renting medical staff, facilities, and other medical resources. Medical data innovation, integration, analysis, and sharing have the potential to dramatically change the current pattern of the health care system and to provide precise and predictive medical assessment for individuals in the future. In addition, artificial intelligence could be useful in the fields of both clinical medicine and medical research and help to minimize the scarcity of human resources and broaden the role of humans in health care.", "Flexible piezoelectric acoustic sensors have been developed to generate multiple sound signals with high sensitivity, shifting the paradigm of future voice technologies. Speech recognition based on advanced acoustic sensors and optimized machine learning software will play an innovative interface for artificial intelligence (AI) services. Collaboration and novel approaches between both smart sensors and speech algorithms should be attempted to realize a hyperconnected society, which can offer personalized services such as biometric authentication, AI secretaries, and home appliances. Here, representative developments in speech recognition are reviewed in terms of flexible piezoelectric materials, self-powered sensors, machine learning algorithms, and speaker recognition.", "People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to enjoy themselves and be engaged when interacting with computers, as these interactions occur in a safe and trustworthy environment. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review on the state of the research on the use of technology to teach people with ASD. We reviewed 94 studies that show how the use of technology in educational contexts helps people with ASD develop several skills, how these approaches consider aspects of user experience, usability and accessibility, and how game elements are used to enrich learning environments. This systematic literature review shows that the development and evaluation of systems and applications for users with ASD is very promising. The use of technological advancements such as virtual agents, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality undoubtedly provides a comfortable environment that promotes constant learning for people with ASD.", "Daily activities are characterized by an increasing interaction with smart machines that present a certain level of autonomy. However, the intelligence of such electronic devices is not always transparent for the end user. This study is aimed at assessing the quality of the remote control of a mobile robot whether the artefact exhibits a human-like behavior or not. The bioinspired behavior implemented in the robot is the well-described two-thirds power law. The performance of participants who teleoperate the semiautonomous vehicle implementing the biological law is compared to a manual and nonbiological mode of control. The results show that the time required to complete the path and the number of collisions with obstacles are significantly lower in the biological condition than in the two other conditions. Also, the highest percentage of occurrences of curvilinear or smooth trajectories are obtained when the steering is assisted by an integration of the power law in the robot's way of working. This advanced analysis of the performance based on the naturalness of the movement kinematics provides a refined evaluation of the quality of the Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). This finding is consistent with the hypothesis of a relationship between the power law and jerk minimization. In addition, the outcome of this study supports the theory of a CNS origin of the power law. The discussion addresses the implications of the anthropocentric approach to enhance the HMI.", "Every year, there are larger and more severe disasters and health organizations are struggling to respond with services to keep public health systems running. Making decisions with limited health information can negatively affect response activities and impact morbidity and mortality. An overarching challenge is getting the right health information to the right health service personnel at the right time. As responding agencies engage in social media (eg, Twitter, Facebook) to communicate with the public, new opportunities emerge to leverage this non-traditional information for improved situational awareness. Transforming these big data is dependent on computers to process and filter content for health information categories relevant to health responders. To enable a more health-focused approach to social media analysis during disasters, 2 major research challenges should be addressed: (1) advancing methodologies to extract relevant information for health services and creating dynamic knowledge bases that address both the global and US disaster contexts, and (2) expanding social media research for disaster informatics to focus on health response activities. There is a lack of attention on health-focused social media research beyond epidemiologic surveillance. Future research will require approaches that address challenges of domain-aware, including multilingual language understanding in artificial intelligence for disaster health information extraction. New research will need to focus on the primary goal of health providers, whose priority is to get the right health information to the right medical and public health service personnel at the right time.", "\"Prepare Yourselves, Robots Will Soon Replace Doctors in Healthcare,\" screamed the headline in a 2017 Forbes magazine article. Media coverage like that makes it easy to see why artificial intelligence (AI) sounds like scary science fiction to some physicians.", "Breast cancer has become the biggest threat to female health. Ultrasonic diagnosis of breast cancer based on artificial intelligence is basically a classification of benign and malignant tumors, which does not meet clinical demand. Besides, the current target detection method performs poorly in detecting small lesions, while it is clinically required to detect nodules below 2 mm. The objective of this study is to (a) propose a diagnostic method based on Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) and (b) increase its detectability of small lesions. We modified the framework of Faster R-CNN (Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) by introducing multi-scale feature extraction and multi-resolution candidate bound extraction into the network. Then, it was trained using 852 images of BI-RADS C2, 739 images of C3, and 1662 images of malignancy (BI-RADS 4a/4b/4c/5/6). We compared our model with unmodified Faster R-CNN and YOLO v3 (You Only Look Once v3). The mean average precision (mAP) is significantly increased to 0.913, while its average detection speed is slightly declined to 4.11 FPS (frames per second). Meanwhile, its detectivity of small lesions is effectively improved. Moreover, we also tentatively applied our model on video sequences and got satisfactory results. We modified Faster R-CNN and trained it partly based on BI-RADS. Its detectability of lesions, as well as small nodules, was significantly improved. In view of wide coverage of dataset and satisfactory test results, our method can basically meet clinical needs.", "Recent studies of the genetic foundations of cognitive ability rely on large samples (in extreme, hundreds of thousands) of individuals from relatively outbred populations of mostly European ancestry. Hypothesizing that the genetic foundation of cognitive ability depends on the broader population-specific genetic context, we performed a genome-wide association study and homozygosity mapping of cognitive ability estimates obtained through latent variable modeling in a sample of 354 children from a consanguineous population of Saudi Arabia. Approximately half of the sample demonstrated significantly elevated homozygosity levels indicative of inbreeding, and among those with elevated levels, homozygosity was negatively associated with cognitive ability. Further homozygosity mapping identified a specific run, inclusive of the GRIA4 gene, that survived corrections for multiple testing for association with cognitive ability. The results suggest that in a consanguineous population, a notable proportion of the variance in cognitive ability in the normal range in children might be regulated by population-specific mechanisms such as patterns of elevated homozygosity. This observation has implications for the field's understanding of the etiological bases of intelligence and its variability around the world.", "Many historical disease eradication campaigns have been characterized by large-scale mobilization and long-term campaigns of mass vaccination. As the duration of a program increases, the total cost also increases, but the effectiveness and sustainability decrease, sometimes resulting in premature loss of stakeholder support, field team fatigue, and failure or major set-backs. In contrast to this trench warfare approach, this paper proposes an eradication strategy modeled on guerrilla tactics: use exceptionally good, locally relevant and timely intelligence; strike rapidly and effectively in small areas; achieve your goals; and keep moving. For peste des petits ruminants eradication, this means a shift away from long-term mass vaccination, focusing instead on addressing some of the challenges that have plagued previous eradication programs: ineffective surveillance and movement management. Recent developments in surveillance have shown that it is now feasible to capture information about almost all cases of disease, all movements and all control activities, from the entire population in real time. Developing powerful, effective and sustainable surveillance systems is an essential prerequisite for rapid, affordable PPR eradication. PPR can be rapidly eliminated from small populations by achieving very high levels of vaccination coverage for only a short period. The key challenge is then to prevent the re-introduction of disease as immunity wanes, and to respond rapidly and effectively in the case of further local outbreaks. A comprehensive understanding of movement patterns and their drivers will allow rapid progressive eradication to be implemented. The population can be divided into manageably small units, targeted sequentially for high-coverage short-duration vaccination, then moving to the next unit based on the distribution of disease and the direction of animal flow. This approach optimizes the use of available resources, and minimizes the challenge and disruption of managing retrograde movement from infected to uninfected areas. High levels of community engagement are required to achieve the quality of surveillance, movement management and rapid response necessary for success. Traditionally, long-term vaccination has been used to first eliminate the virus from a population, and then to protect it against re-introduction of the disease. Under the guerrilla strategy, continuous real-time information, not long-term vaccination, is the main tool for disease eradication.", "Gaps in colonoscopy skills among endoscopists, primarily due to experience, have been identified, and solutions are critically needed. Hence, the development of a real-time robust detection system for colorectal neoplasms is considered to significantly reduce the risk of missed lesions during colonoscopy. Here, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system that automatically detects early signs of colorectal cancer during colonoscopy; the AI system shows the sensitivity and specificity are 97.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u200995.9%-98.4%) and 99.0% (95% CI\u2009=\u200998.6%-99.2%), respectively, and the area under the curve is 0.975 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.964-0.986) in the validation set. Moreover, the sensitivities are 98.0% (95% CI\u2009=\u200996.6%-98.8%) in the polypoid subgroup and 93.7% (95% CI\u2009=\u200987.6%-96.9%) in the non-polypoid subgroup; To accelerate the detection, tensor metrics in the trained model was decomposed, and the system can predict cancerous regions 21.9\u2009ms/image on average. These findings suggest that the system is sufficient to support endoscopists in the high detection against non-polypoid lesions, which are frequently missed by optical colonoscopy. This AI system can alert endoscopists in real-time to avoid missing abnormalities such as non-polypoid polyps during colonoscopy, improving the early detection of this disease.", "Receptive and expressive vocabulary in adult and adolescent males with fragile X syndrome (FXS) have been shown as significantly lower than their chronological age; however, receptive vocabulary has been considered a strength relative to mental age. This has not been formally examined, however, and data are needed to compare receptive vocabulary with other language skills and with mental age in individuals with FXS. This is especially important as vocabulary measures are sometimes used as a proxy to estimate language ability.\nThis preliminary study examined receptive vocabulary, global language, and cognitive skills in 42 adults (33 males and 9 females) with FXS as a portion of the baseline evaluation prior to randomization in a clinical trial of ampakine CX516. The battery of standardized tests addressed receptive vocabulary with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Third Edition (PPVT-III), receptive and expressive language (termed henceforth as global language) via the Preschool Language Scale, Fourth Edition or the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Third Edition, and non-verbal cognition via the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, Fourth Edition (SB-IV).\nResults showed (1) significantly higher receptive vocabulary than global language, (2) significantly better receptive vocabulary than non-verbal cognition, (3) equivalent non-verbal cognition and global language, and (4) severity of autism symptomatology was not correlated to receptive vocabulary or global language once non-verbal cognition was removed as factor. The scores from the PPVT-III did not represent the global language skills in our sample of adults with FXS.\nFindings from this investigation strongly suggest that the PPVT-III should not be used as a screening tool for language levels or cognitive function in clinical studies since the scores from the PPVT-III were not representative of global language or non-verbal cognitive skills in adults with intellectual disabilities. This finding is critical in order to understand how to evaluate, as well as to treat, language in individuals with FXS. Development of efficient and appropriate tools to measure language, cognition, and behavior in individuals with FXS is essential.", "Point defects, such as oxygen vacancies, control the physical properties of complex oxides, relevant in active areas of research from superconductivity to resistive memory to catalysis. In most oxide semiconductors, electrons that are associated with oxygen vacancies occupy the conduction band, leading to an increase in the electrical conductivity. Here we demonstrate, in contrast, that in the correlated-electron perovskite rare-earth nickelates, RNiO3 (R is a rare-earth element such as Sm or Nd), electrons associated with oxygen vacancies strongly localize, leading to a dramatic decrease in the electrical conductivity by several orders of magnitude. This unusual behavior is found to stem from the combination of crystal field splitting and filling-controlled Mott-Hubbard electron-electron correlations in the Ni 3d orbitals. Furthermore, we show the distribution of oxygen vacancies in NdNiO3 can be controlled via an electric field, leading to analog resistance switching behavior. This study demonstrates the potential of nickelates as testbeds to better understand emergent physics in oxide heterostructures as well as candidate systems in the emerging fields of artificial intelligence.", "Since 2010, substantial progress has been made in artificial intelligence (AI) and its application to medicine. AI is explored in gastroenterology for endoscopic analysis of lesions, in detection of cancer, and to facilitate the analysis of inflammatory lesions or gastrointestinal bleeding during wireless capsule endoscopy. AI is also tested to assess liver fibrosis and to differentiate patients with pancreatic cancer from those with pancreatitis. AI might also be used to establish prognoses of patients or predict their response to treatments, based on multiple factors. We review the ways in which AI may help physicians make a diagnosis or establish a prognosis and discuss its limitations, knowing that further randomized controlled studies will be required before the approval of AI techniques by the health authorities.", "HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are characterized by cognitive, behavioral, and motor dysfunctions, which impact daily functioning and are predictive of poor survival among patients. The diagnosis of HAND is marked by clinically significant declines in multiple domains of neurocognitive functioning. Some patients diagnosed with HAND have social problem; however, higher brain dysfunction is not detected in general neuropsychological assessments and the intelligence quotient may remain unchanged. Impaired decision-making may reduce social and occupational qualities of life. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been developed as a task to evaluate risk predictions at the time of decision-making. In the present study, 38 HIV-infected patients enrolled in our hospital performed IGT and we investigated whether the results obtained are associated with HAND. The median net IGT score of all HIV-infected subjects was significantly lower than that of healthy controls. Patients diagnosed with HAND accounted for 43.8% of the negative net score group. We elucidated the relationship between the net IGT score and HAND for the first time. We think that IGT is a good tool to detect decision-making impairment for ANI and MND. Careful follow-ups of the progression of HAND and increased awareness among HIV-infected patients and medical care workers of the risk of social behavioral disorders, which negatively impact daily life before they are detected, are needed in order to prevent deteriorations in the quality of life of these patients.", "Zuckerman et al. (2013) conducted a meta-analysis of 63 studies that showed a negative intelligence-religiosity relation (IRR). As more studies have become available and because some of Zuckerman et al.'s (2013) conclusions have been challenged, we conducted a new meta-analysis with an updated data set of 83 studies. Confirming previous conclusions, the new analysis showed that the correlation between intelligence and religious beliefs in college and noncollege samples ranged from -.20 to -.23. There was no support for mediation of the IRR by education but there was support for partial mediation by analytic cognitive style. Thus, one possible interpretation for the IRR is that intelligent people are more likely to use analytic style (i.e., approach problems more rationally). An alternative (and less interesting) reason for the mediation is that tests of both intelligence and analytic style assess cognitive ability. Additional empirical and theoretical work is needed to resolve this issue.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the key drivers of digital health. Digital health and AI applications in medicine and biology are emerging worldwide, not only in resource-rich but also resource-limited regions. AI predates to the mid-20th century, but the current wave of AI builds in part on machine learning (ML), big data, and algorithms that can learn from massive amounts of online user data from patients or healthy persons. There are lessons to be learned from AI applications in different medical specialties and across developed and resource-limited contexts. A case in point is congenital heart defects (CHDs) that continue to plague sub-Saharan Africa, which calls for innovative approaches to improve risk prediction and performance of the available diagnostics. Beyond CHDs, AI in cardiology is a promising context as well. The current suite of digital health applications in CHD and cardiology include complementary technologies such as neural networks, ML, natural language processing and deep learning, not to mention embedded digital sensors. Algorithms that build on these advances are beginning to complement traditional medical expertise while inviting us to redefine the concepts and definitions of expertise in molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. We examine and share here the lessons learned in current attempts to implement AI and digital health in CHD for precision risk prediction and diagnosis in resource-limited settings. These top 10 lessons on AI and digital health summarized in this expert review are relevant broadly beyond CHD in cardiology and medical innovations. As with AI itself that calls for systems approaches to data capture, analysis, and interpretation, both developed and developing countries can usefully learn from their respective experiences as digital health continues to evolve worldwide.", "Objective: To summarize the experience and effectivity of brain protection in 25 patients who suffered from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and received pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 25 PTE surgeries in our center from December 2016 to August 2018. All cases were completed underdeep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Standard brain protections were strictly executed, including: balanced and controlled extracorporeal circulation cooling, cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) monitoring, strictly control of circulatory arrest time, and etc. The neurological adverse events during the perioperative period were recorded and statistically analyzed, and the intelligence level and cognitive function of the patients were evaluated by MMSE scale and MoCA scale before surgery and discharge. Results: All the 25 patients successfully completed the surgery, and 1 patient (4%) died of postoperative infection. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from (52.9\u00b116.7) mmHg before surgery to (23.6\u00b18.1) mmHg immediately after surgery (t=10.01, P<0.01), and(20.7\u00b17.9) mmHg at 3 months follow-up (t=10.73, P<0.01). Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 975.4 (788.6-1 292.8) dyn\u00b7s\u00b7cm(-5) to 376.1 (283.6-565.5) dyn\u00b7s\u00b7cm(-5) (Z=5.34, P<0.01). Neurological complications occurred in 3 patients during the perioperative period, including 2 patients with hypoxic encephalopathy, and 1 patient with cerebral hemorrhage. All 3 patients fully recovered before discharge. Univariate analysis showed that the duration of rSO(2)<40% and the maximum decrease rate of rSO(2) from baseline were significantly correlated with postoperative neurological damage. Multivariate analysis showed only time of rSO(2)<40% was significantly correlated with postoperative neurological damage. There was no significant difference in MMSE and MoCA score before and after surgery (P>0.05). Conclusions: Adequate brain protection measures are essential to reduce the neurological complications of PTE surgery. Real-time intraoperative monitoring of rSO(2) and strict control of circulatory arrest time can further reduce the occurrence of neurological damage.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u603b\u7ed3\u6162\u6027\u8840\u6813\u6813\u585e\u6027\u80ba\u52a8\u8109\u9ad8\u538b\uff08CTEPH\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u884c\u6df1\u4f4e\u6e29-\u505c\u5faa\u73af\u4e0b\u80ba\u52a8\u8109\u8840\u6813\u5185\u819c\u5265\u8131\u672f\uff08PTE\uff09\u672f\u4e2d\u8111\u4fdd\u62a4\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53ca\u6548\u679c\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u65e5\u53cb\u597d\u533b\u96622016\u5e7412\u6708\u81f32018\u5e748\u6708\u95f425\u4f8bPTE\u624b\u672f\u8d44\u6599\u3002\u5168\u90e8\u624b\u672f\u5747\u5728\u6df1\u4f4e\u6e29\u505c\u5faa\u73af\u4e0b\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u672f\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8111\u4fdd\u62a4\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u4f53\u5916\u5faa\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u5747\u8861\u964d\u6e29\u3001\u8111\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u505c\u5faa\u73af\u65f6\u95f4\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u8111\u8868\u9762\u6052\u5b9a\u4f4e\u6e29\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b49\u3002\u7edf\u8ba1\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u56f4\u624b\u672f\u671f\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u826f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u672f\u524d\u53ca\u51fa\u9662\u524d\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u6613\u667a\u529b\u72b6\u6001\u68c0\u67e5\uff08MMSE\uff09\u91cf\u8868\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u8ba4\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08MoCA\uff09\u91cf\u8868\u8bc4\u4f30\u60a3\u8005\u667a\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u53ca\u8ba4\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a 25\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u5747\u987a\u5229\u5b8c\u6210\u624b\u672f\uff0c1\u4f8b\uff084%\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u672f\u540e\u56e0\u611f\u67d3\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3002\u60a3\u8005\u5e73\u5747\u80ba\u52a8\u8109\u538b\uff08mPAP\uff09\u7531\u672f\u524d\uff0852.9\u00b116.7\uff09mmHg\u964d\u81f3\u672f\u540e\u5373\u523b\u7684\uff0823.6\u00b18.1\uff09mmHg\u4ee5\u53ca\u672f\u540e3\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\uff0820.7\u00b17.9\uff09mmHg\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08t=10.01\u300110.73\uff0c\u5747P<0.01\uff09\u3002\u60a3\u8005\u80ba\u8840\u7ba1\u963b\u529b\uff08PVR\uff09\u7531\u672f\u524d975.4\uff08788.6~1 292.8\uff09dyn\u00b7s\u00b7cm(-5)\u964d\u81f3376.1\uff08283.6~565.5\uff09dyn\u00b7s\u00b7cm(-5)\uff08Z=5.34\uff0cP<0.01\uff09\u3002\u56f4\u624b\u672f\u671f\u51713\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u51fa\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d2\u4f8b\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u6c27\u6027\u8111\u75c5\uff0c1\u4f8b\u4e3a\u8111\u51fa\u8840\uff0c\u6b643\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u5747\u4e8e\u51fa\u9662\u524d\u5b8c\u5168\u5eb7\u590d\u3002\u5355\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5c40\u90e8\u8111\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\uff08rSO(2)\uff09<40%\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u53carSO(2)\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u5927\u4e0b\u964d\u7387\u4e0e\u672f\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u635f\u5bb3\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4ec5rSO(2)<40%\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u672f\u540e\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u635f\u5bb3\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u60a3\u8005\u672f\u524d\u53ca\u672f\u540eMMSE\u91cf\u8868\u548cMoCA\u91cf\u8868\u8bc4\u5206\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08\u5747P>0.05\uff09\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u5145\u5206\u7684\u8111\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u5bf9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4ePTE\u624b\u672f\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4brSO(2)\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u505c\u5faa\u73af\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u635f\u5bb3\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u3002.", "Numerous studies have found a negative relationship between religiousness and IQ. It is in the region of -\u20090.2, according to meta-analyses. The reasons for this relationship are, however, unknown. It has been suggested that higher intelligence leads to greater attraction to science, or that it helps to override evolved cognitive dispositions such as for religiousness. Either way, such explanations assume that the religion-IQ nexus is on general intelligence (g), rather than some subset of specialized cognitive abilities. In other words, they assume it is a Jensen effect. Two large datasets comparing groups with different levels of religiousness show that their IQ differences are not on g and must, therefore, be attributed to specialized abilities. An analysis of the specialized abilities on which the religious and non-religious groups differ reveals no clear pattern. We cautiously suggest that this may be explicable in terms of autism spectrum disorder traits among people with high IQ scores, because such traits are negatively associated with religiousness.", "Diagnosing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) depends on individual physician expertise and may be subject to interobserver variability. Therefore, we developed a computerized image-analysis system to detect and differentiate esophageal SCC.\nA total of 9591 nonmagnified endoscopy (non-ME) and 7844 ME images of pathologically confirmed superficial esophageal SCCs and 1692 non-ME and 3435 ME images from noncancerous lesions or normal esophagus were used as training image data. Validation was performed using 255 non-ME white-light images, 268 non-ME narrow-band images/blue-laser images, and 204 ME narrow-band images/blue-laser images from 135 patients. The same validation test data were diagnosed by 15 board-certified specialists (experienced endoscopists).\nRegarding diagnosis by non-ME with narrow-band imaging/blue-laser imaging, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 100%, 63%, and 77%, respectively, for the artificial intelligence (AI) system and 92%, 69%, and 78%, respectively, for the experienced endoscopists. Regarding diagnosis by non-ME with white-light imaging, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 90%, 76%, and 81%, respectively, for the AI system and 87%, 67%, and 75%, respectively, for the experienced endoscopists. Regarding diagnosis by ME, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 98%, 56%, and 77%, respectively, for the AI system and 83%, 70%, and 76%, respectively, for the experienced endoscopists. There was no significant difference in the diagnostic performance between the AI system and the experienced endoscopists.\nOur AI system showed high sensitivity for detecting SCC by non-ME and high accuracy for differentiating SCC from noncancerous lesions by ME.", "Multimodality imaging plays an important role in the initial evaluation, diagnosis and management of patients suspected of having a cardiomyopathy. Beyond functional and anatomical information, multimodality imaging provides important variables that facilitate risk stratification and prognosis evaluation. Whatever the underlying suspected cardiomyopathy, echocardiography is the most common initial imaging test used to establish the presence of cardiomyopathy, by depicting structural and functional abnormalities. However, echocardiographic findings are non-specific, and therefore have a limited role in identifying the underlying aetiology. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging allows characterization of myocardial tissue, which can be of great help in identifying the aetiology of the cardiomyopathy. When a specific aetiology is suspected, particularly inflammation, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is recommended. The clinician should be capable of selecting the appropriate imaging techniques for each clinical scenario. Each technique has strengths and weaknesses, which should be known. In order to improve diagnostic performance, and as proposed by the European Association for Cardiovascular Imaging, cardiovascular imaging groups must be composed of experts from all modalities. The future of multimodality imaging in the diagnosis and management of cardiomyopathies will also involve evolution of its use in care, teaching and research. Training goals for future cardiac imaging experts must be defined; academic and industry partnerships should enable the connection to be made between imaging data and clinical data on the one hand and outcomes on the other hand, using big-data analysis and artificial intelligence.", "Iodine intake must be boosted during pregnancy to meet the demands for increased production and placental transfer of thyroid hormone essential for optimal foetal development. Failure to meet this challenge results in irreversible brain damage, manifested in severity from neurological cretinism to minor or subtle deficits of intelligence and behavioural disorders. Attention is now being focused on explaining observational studies of an association between insufficient iodine intake during pregnancy and mild degrees of intellectual impairment in the offspring and confirming a cause and effect relationship with impaired maternal thyroid function. The current qualitative categorisation of iodine deficiency into mild, moderate and severe by the measurement of the median urinary iodine concentration (MUIC) in a population of school-age children, as a proxy measure of dietary iodine intake, is inappropriate for defining the degree or severity of gestational iodine deficiency and needs to be replaced. This review examines progress in analytical techniques for the measurement of urinary iodine concentration and the application of this technology to epidemiological studies of iodine deficiency with a focus on gestational iodine deficiency. We recommend that more precise definitions and measurements of gestational iodine deficiency, beyond a spot UIC, need to be developed. We review the evidence for hypothyroxinaemia as the cause of intrauterine foetal brain damage in gestational iodine deficiency and discuss the many unanswered questions, from which we propose that further clinical studies need to be designed to address the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental impairments in the foetus and infant. Agreement on the testing instruments and standardization of processes and procedures for Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and psychomotor tests needs to be reached by investigators, so that valid comparisons can be made among studies of gestational iodine deficiency and neurocognitive outcomes. Finally, the timing, safety and the efficacy of prophylactic iodine supplementation for pregnant and lactating women needs to be established and confirmation that excess intake of iodine during pregnancy is to be avoided.", "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) affects up to 4% of a pediatric population, with many comorbidities in the medium-long term. Functional alterations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may explain why OSAS impacts aspects such as executive functions, memory, motor control, attention, visual-spatial skills, learning, and mood regulation. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a complex neuropsychological function that could be impaired in many clinical conditions.\nThe aim of the study is to evaluate the difference in emotional intelligence skills among children with OSAS and healthy subjects (nOSAS).\n129 children (72 males; mean age 7.64 \u00b1 1.98 years) affected by OSAS were compared to 264 non-OSAS (nOSAS) children (138 males; mean age 7.98 \u00b1 2.13) similar for gender, age, and socioeconomic status. In order to assess the emotional quotient, the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory: Youth Version (EQ-i:YV) was used.\nThe comparison for means and standard deviation between OSAS children and nOSAS children for EQ-i:YV scores showed significant differences for Interpersonal, Adaptability, and Stress Management scales and EQ Total score.\nOur findings highlighted the role of intermittent hypoxia in the genesis of the effects of sleep-related respiratory disorders, which involves also aspects different from physical impairments.", "The key to understanding the burden of animal bites and rabies lies in accurate and timely data with the help of proper surveillance system across the country. Such a surveillance system needs to be evaluated also for a programmatic purpose.\nThe present study was conducted to appraise the surveillance system of human rabies and animal bites in seven states of India and also to describe the characteristics of human rabies cases in the states.\nThe record-based study was conducted from July to December 2017. The survey team collected information about the surveillance status of human rabies from the infectious diseases hospitals and animal bites from integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) offices of the respective states for 2012-2016. At the national level, also number of animal exposures and the human rabies cases were collected from the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence and IDSP and compared for concordance.\nThere was a gross underreporting of human rabies from the states to Government of India, and there was no concordance in the reports of animal bites between the IDSP offices of the states and NCDC, New Delhi, India. There was a gradual decline in the reported cases of human rabies from the states during the 5-year period of 2012-2016, attributable to improvement in the overall rabies postexposure prophylaxis services. The documentation of information of the human rabies cases was poor in the infectious disease hospitals.\nThe surveillance system on human rabies and animal bites in India has to be improved under the national rabies control program to eliminate rabies by the year 2030.", "The diet of most adults is low in fish and, therefore, provides limited quantities of the long-chain, omega-3 fatty acids (LCn-3FAs), eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA, DHA). Since these compounds serve important roles in the brain, we sought to determine if healthy adults with low-LCn-3FA consumption would exhibit improvements in neuropsychological performance and parallel changes in brain morphology following repletion through fish oil supplementation.\nIn a randomized, controlled trial, 271 mid-life adults (30-54 years of age, 118 men, 153 women) consuming \u2a7d300 mg/day of LCn-3FAs received 18 weeks of supplementation with fish oil capsules (1400 mg/day of EPA and DHA) or matching placebo. All participants completed a neuropsychological test battery examining four cognitive domains: psychomotor speed, executive function, learning/episodic memory, and fluid intelligence. A subset of 122 underwent neuroimaging before and after supplementation to measure whole-brain and subcortical tissue volumes.\nCapsule adherence was over 95%, participant blinding was verified, and red blood cell EPA and DHA levels increased as expected. Supplementation did not affect performance in any of the four cognitive domains. Exploratory analyses revealed that, compared to placebo, fish oil supplementation improved executive function in participants with low-baseline DHA levels. No changes were observed in any indicator of brain morphology.\nIn healthy mid-life adults reporting low-dietary intake, supplementation with LCn-3FAs in moderate dose for moderate duration did not affect neuropsychological performance or brain morphology. Whether salutary effects occur in individuals with particularly low-DHA exposure requires further study.", "Machine learning has shown its importance in delivering healthcare solutions and revolutionizing the future of filtering huge amountd of textual content. The machine intelligence can adapt semantic relations among text to infer finer contextual information and language processing system can use this information for better decision support and quality of life care. Further, a learnt model can efficiently utilize written healthcare information in knowledgeable patterns. The word-document and document-document linkage can help in gaining better contextual information. We analyzed 124 research articles in text and healthcare domain related to the ML paradigm and showed the mechanism of intelligence to capture hidden insights from document representation where only a term or word is used to explain the phenomenon. Mostly in the research, document-word relations are identified while relations with other documents are ignored. This paper emphasizes text representations and its linage with ML, DL, and RL approaches, which is an important marker for intelligence segregation. Furthermore, we highlighted the advantages of ML and DL methods as powerful tools for automatic text classification tasks.", "Intelligence typically is defined as consisting of \"adaptation to the environment\" or in related terms. Yet, it is not clear that \"general intelligence\" or g, traditionally conceptualized in terms of a general factor in a psychometrically-based hierarchical model of intelligence, provides an optimal way of defining intelligence as adaptation to the environment. Such a definition of adaptive intelligence would need to be biologically based in terms of evolutionary theory, would need to take into account the cultural context of adaptation, and would need to take into account whether thought and behavior labeled as \"adaptively intelligent\" actually contributed to the perpetuation of the human and other species, or whether it was indifferent or actually destructive to this perpetuation. In this article, I consider the similarities and differences between \"general intelligence\" and \"adaptive intelligence,\" as well as the implications especially of the differences.", "Introduction: There is growing emphasis on the development of bioinspired and biohybrid micro/nanorobots for the targeted drug delivery (TDD). Particularly, stimuli-responsive materials and magnetically triggered systems, identified as the most promising materials and design paradigms. Despite the advances made in fabrication and control, there remains a significant gap in clinical translation. Areas covered: This review discusses the opportunities and challenges about micro/nanorobotics for the TDD as evolutionary evidence in bio-nanotechnology, material science, biohybrid robotics, and many more. Important consideration in context with the material's compatibility/immunogenicity, ethics, and security risk are reported based on the development in artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning described in literature. The versatility and sophistication of biohybrid components design are being presented, highlighting stimuli-responsive biosystems as smart mechanisms and on-board sensing and control elements. Expert opinion: Focusing on key issues for high controllability at micro- and nano-scale systems in TDD, biohybrid integration strategies, and bioinspired key competences shall be adopted. The promising outlook portraying the commercialization potential and economic viability of micro/nanorobotics will benefit to clinical translation.", "There are numerous gender- and sex-based differences that contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality related to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in women. Early detection of risk and targeted management of atherosclerotic disease is fundamental to reduce ASCVD risk and improve outcomes in women. In this review, we examine the utility of cardiac computed tomography (CT) and coronary CT angiography (CTA) in three ASCVD scenarios including coronary artery calcium scoring for risk stratification in asymptomatic women, and coronary CTA for diagnosis and prognosis of stable ischemic heart disease and acute chest pain. The risks of radiation exposure and the potential applications of novel technologies in women are explored.\nCTA provides the capabilities of early recognition and management of nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Recent advancements in plaque composition and morphology further enhance the prognostic yield from coronary CTA. Innovations in stress perfusion and computational fluid dynamics allow for evaluation of physiological measures of ischemia. In addition, developments in artificial intelligence (AI) may also help unlock a deeper understanding of atherosclerosis and risk in women. Coronary CTA is an accurate and useful modality for early detection and management of ASCVD in women. Novel technologies hold great promise for furthering our understanding of sex-specific pathophysiology and potential improvement in clinical management and outcomes.", "Current semen analysis still commonly depends on a manual microscopy method in clinical laboratories worldwide. However, some of the major disadvantages of this technique are that it is labour-intensive, subjective, laboratory-based and time-consuming. Although computer-assisted semen analysers (CASAs) have enabled partial automation of routine semen analysis, they lack wider acceptance due to their complicated operation. Therefore, the development of an accessible, rapid and standardised method for semen analysis is urgently needed. Here, we describe the development and clinical testing of a novel, automated, artificial intelligence optical microscopic (AIOM)-based technology, LensHooke\u2122 X1 PRO (X1 PRO), designed for the quantitative measurement of sperm concentration, motility and seminal pH. We observed high degree of correlation in the results of concentration, progressive motility and progressively motile sperm concentration between the X1 PRO semen analyser and manual method using 135 clinical semen samples. In addition, the seminal pH results obtained by X1 PRO and manual methods were comparable (p\u00a0=\u00a0.12). In summary, our results showed that new X1 PRO semen analyser is a reliable diagnostic tool for routine semen analysis providing clinically acceptable results based on World Health Organization (WHO) 5th Edition guidelines.", "Background. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may suffer from working memory deficits, which can adversely affect their academic performance. Neurofeedback training may enhance working memory and provide a solution to this problem. Aim. To investigate the effect of frequency-neurofeedback on working memory in children with ADHD and to check if the effect is long-lasting. Method. Forty-eight children with ADHD (aged 6-12 years) were randomly assigned either to a neurofeedback with training parameters chosen to take into account each child's peak alpha frequency (PAF) or to a waiting list control group. Each trained child underwent 19-channel electroencephalography (EEG). All children had average intelligence and none were receiving treatment, such as medications, for ADHD. Prior to the training, MOXO and n-back tests were performed. Next, neurofeedback training sessions with frequency bands for theta and beta ranges determined using each child's PAF were carried out for 10 weeks. Training parameters were set to increase amplitudes in the low beta range and to decrease amplitudes in the theta and high beta frequency ranges. The n-back test was performed again right after the training and then a year later. Results. During the first n-back test, children from both groups responded correctly to more than 43% of the stimuli. During the second test, children from the waiting list responded correctly to an average of 49% of the stimuli, while children who underwent the neurofeedback training were correct, on average, 69% of the time (significant difference, P < .001). During the third n-back test a year later, children from the waiting list responded correctly to 53% of the stimuli, while those who underwent the neurofeedback training responded correctly to nearly 71%. Conclusion. This study found a statistically significant improvement in a measure of working memory in children who did 10 to 12 sessions of neurofeedback training with training frequency ranges for theta and beta defined according to each child's PAF. The beneficial effects were still present a year after training.", "In a 2015 Hastings Center Report essay, Robert Truog and his coauthors argued that the clinical ethics portion of medical education should cast both a wider and a finer net than is sometimes realized. Many of the morally important moments in patient care are missed if we teach only general moral principles, they held; we also need to give attention to an indefinite stream of \"microethical\" decisions in everyday clinical practice. In the current issue, Truog plays out a similar theme as he discusses the moral significance of touching a patient and asks how artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies may change this ancient part of the physician-patient relationship. And one of the articles in this issue examines the significance of clinicians' relationships with other clinicians. Donna Chen and colleagues propose, in effect, that \"teamwork\" has become part of the ethics of everyday clinical practice-a new addition to what Larry Churchill and David Schenck called the \"healing skills.\"", "There is no escaping the fact that academics are devoting unrelenting attention to the impact artificial intelligence will have on health care. Radiological and radiation oncology organizations worldwide are devoting their time and resources to ensure their members are both informed and prepared for the inevitable changes to the respective professions. This commentary provides an overview of how artificial intelligence will affect medical radiation professions of both diagnostic and radiation therapy streams. It outlines how these professions can play an active role in ensuring optimal outcomes for the well-being of both the workforce and the patients.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is not intelligent in the human meaning-AI works on the basis of algorithms created by humans and the results of AI are based on real-world data. AI is regulated by all legal frameworks that also apply in other scenarios, in particular data protection law and medical device law. AI delivers results that are as good as the database that formed the learning content of the AI enables. If, for example, the data on which the AI is based contain discrimination, this discrimination is \"learned\" by the AI; since the AI does not really think, the AI cannot reflect its own results either-it can only make a\u00a0comparison within the parameters of the specifications by the software developers. If AI is used, the question of the algorithms implemented and the database on which the decision is based must therefore be clarified beforehand and a\u00a0check must be carried out based on this to determine whether the AI is suitable for use. Due to the missing possibility of real human thinking, AI cannot replace physicians, but can assist them in their daily work.", "To discuss recent applications of artificial intelligence within the field of neuro-oncology and highlight emerging challenges in integrating artificial intelligence within clinical practice.\nIn the field of image analysis, artificial intelligence has shown promise in aiding clinicians with incorporating an increasing amount of data in genomics, detection, diagnosis, classification, risk stratification, prognosis, and treatment response. Artificial intelligence has also been applied in epigenetics, pathology, and natural language processing.\nAlthough nascent, applications of artificial intelligence within neuro-oncology show significant promise. Artificial intelligence algorithms will likely improve our understanding of brain tumors and help drive future innovations in neuro-oncology.", "This is a condensed summary of an international multisociety statement on ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology produced by the ACR, European Society of Radiology, RSNA, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine, European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine.AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence, and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice.This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future.The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI which promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes.", "Objective: A prominent challenge in modeling choice is specification of the underlying cognitive processes. Many cognitive-based models of decision-making draw substantially on algorithmic models of artificial intelligence and thus rely on associated metaphors of this field. In contrast, the current study avoids metaphors and aims at a first-hand identification of the behavioral elements of a process of choice. Method : We designed a game in Mouselab resembling the real-world procedure of choosing a wife. 17 male subjects were exposed to cost-benefit decision criteria that closely mimic their societal respective conditions. Results: The quality of choice index was measured with respect to its sensitivity to the final outcomes as well as process tracing of decisions. The correlation between this index and individual components of process tracing are discussed in detail. The choice quality index can be configured as a function of expected value and utility. In our sample the quality of choice with an average of 75.98% (SD: \u00b112.67) suggests that subjects obtained close to 76% of their expected gains. Conclusion: The quality of choice index, therefore, may be used for comparison of different conditions where the variables of decision-making are altered. The analysis of results also reveals that the cost of incorrect choice is significantly correlated with expected value (0.596, sig = 0.012) but not with utility. This means that when sub-jects face higher costs prior to making a decision, there exists a corresponding higher expectation of gains, i.e., higher expected value.", "Individual differences in executive functions (EF) are heritable and predictive of academic attainment (AA). However, little is known about genetic contributions to EFs or their genetic relationship with AA and intelligence. We conducted genome-wide association analyses for processing speed (PS) and the latent EF measures of working memory (WM) and inhibitory control (IC) in 4,611 adolescents from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. While no loci reached genome-wide significance, common genetic variants explained 30% of the variance in WM and 19% in PS. In contrast, we failed to find common genetic contributions to IC. Finally, we examined shared genetic effects between EFs and general intelligence, AA and ADHD. We identified significant genetic correlations between WM, intelligence, and AA. A more specific pattern was observed for PS, with modest genetic overlap with intelligence. Together these findings highlight diversity in the genetic contributions to specific cognitive functions and their genetic relationship with educational and psychiatric outcomes.", "The artificial skin-like stretchable ionic sensor device usually requires a synergistic effect of reliable adhesion between human machine interface, reasonable mechanical strength, and visually displayable transparency. A plant-inspired zwitterionic hydrogel was prepared through rapid UV initiation in the existence of cellulose nanocrystals as physically crosslinker and reinforcing agent. The resulting transparent zwitterionic nanocomposite hydrogel successfully brings the synergistic advantages of robust adhesive strength between diversified substrates such as skins, plastics, glass, and steels with remarkable mechanical properties of a superior stretchability over 1000% strain, a mechanical tensile strength up to 0.61 MPa, and compressive strength up to 7.5 MPa, manifesting in superior ionic transport performance, simultaneously. Furthermore, the zwitterionic nanocomposite hydrogel was fabricated as a wearable compliant stretchable pressure-strain sensor in the modality of the skin-adhesive patch to be sensitive to human motion such as finger touch and speech recognition for personal healthcare of patient sensory rebuilding and physiological data acquisition. It maintains compressive cycling sensibility at diverse pressure during 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 Hz, respectively. The multifunctional zwitterionic nanocomposite hydrogel could also be assembled into flexible electrical devices such as luminescent display and information transfer between human and robot communication for mechanosensory electronics and artificial intelligence.", "Psychosis proneness has been linked to heightened Openness to Experience and to cognitive deficits. Openness and psychotic disorders are associated with the default and frontoparietal networks, and the latter network is also robustly associated with intelligence. We tested the hypothesis that functional connectivity of the default and frontoparietal networks is a neural correlate of the openness-psychoticism dimension. Participants in the Human Connectome Project (N = 1003) completed measures of psychoticism, openness, and intelligence. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify intrinsic connectivity networks. Structural equation modeling revealed relations among personality, intelligence, and network coherence. Psychoticism, openness, and especially their shared variance were related positively to default network coherence and negatively to frontoparietal coherence. These associations remained after controlling for intelligence. Intelligence was positively related to frontoparietal coherence. Research suggests that psychoticism and openness are linked in part through their association with connectivity in networks involving experiential simulation and cognitive control. We propose a model of psychosis risk that highlights roles of the default and frontoparietal networks. Findings echo research on functional connectivity in psychosis patients, suggesting shared mechanisms across the personality-psychopathology continuum.", "Cognitive deficits after perinatal brain lesion in preterm infants are among the most common neurodevelopmental disturbances. The relationship between structural changes on at term magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive deficits in the preschool age should be a special focus due to timely intervention. The aim of this study was to correlate qualitative and quantitative MRI parameters of perinatal brain lesion in preterm children, on early neonatal MRI and follow up MRI, with general and specific cognitive functions in the preschool age.\nTwenty-one preterm infants with verified perinatal lesions based on clinical and ultrasound data underwent a brain MRI at term-equivalent age and a second MRI between 3 and 5 years of age. Qualitative and quantitative MRI analyses were done. All subjects underwent cognitive assessment (3-5 years) using Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III) and Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY-II).\nResults show that many structural changes on at term MRI and on follow up MRI in preterm born children moderately correlate with specific cognitive deficits in preschool age. At term equivalent MRI, white matter changes and cortical thickness correlate to general and specific cognitive functions in infants born preterm. By analyzing follow up MRI at preschool age, structural changes of different white matter segments, corpus callosum, cortical thickness and lobe volume correlate to some specific cognitive functions.\nBesides general cognitive delay, specific cognitive deficits in preterm children should be targeted in research and intervention, optimally combined with MRI scanning, providing timely and early intervention of cognitive deficits after perinatal brain lesion. Our results, as well as previously published results, suggest the importance of detailed preschool neuropsychological assessment, prior to enrolment in the school system. Although preliminary, our results expand our understanding of the relationship between early brain developmental lesions and cognitive outcome following premature birth.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) will pave the way to a new era in medicine. However, currently available AI systems do not interact with a patient, e.g., for anamnesis, and thus are only used by the physicians for predictions in diagnosis or prognosis. However, these systems are widely used, e.g., in diabetes or cancer prediction. In the current study, we developed an AI that is able to interact with a patient (virtual doctor) by using a speech recognition and speech synthesis system and thus can autonomously interact with the patient, which is particularly important for, e.g., rural areas, where the availability of primary medical care is strongly limited by low population densities. As a proof-of-concept, the system is able to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on non-invasive sensors and deep neural networks. Moreover, the system provides an easy-to-interpret probability estimation for T2DM for a given patient. Besides the development of the AI, we further analyzed the acceptance of young people for AI in healthcare to estimate the impact of such a system in the future.", "De novo or rare transmitted mutations in the SMAD6 gene affect 7 percent of midline nonsyndromic synostosis patients. This study aimed to determine the neurocognitive sequelae of SMAD6 synostosis.\nNonsyndromic synostosis patients 6 years or older with SMAD6 mutations and non-SMAD6 nonsyndromic synostosis controls were recruited. All patients completed a double-blinded neurodevelopmental battery (i.e., Wechsler Fundamentals, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Beery-Buktenica Developmental test), and parents/guardians completed behavioral surveys (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function and Behavior Rating System for Children).\nTwenty-eight patients participated: 10 known SMAD6 patients (average age, 10 years; 1 female; eight metopic and two sagittal; nine treated with cranial vault remodeling and one treated with strip craniectomy) and 18 non-SMAD6 controls (age, 9.5 years; three female; 12 metopic and six sagittal; 17 treated with cranial vault remodeling and one treated with strip craniectomy). There were no differences between any demographics. Testing age, surgical age, parental education, and household income correlated with cognition (p < 0.05). After controlling for these factors, SMAD6 patients performed worse on numerical operations (p = 0.046), performance intelligence quotient (p = 0.018), full-scale intelligence quotient (p = 0.010), and motor coordination (p = 0.043) compared to age/race/gender/synostosis/operation-matched controls. On behavioral surveys, SMAD6 patients scored worse on 14 assessments, including aggression, communication, and behavior.\nThis prospective double-blinded study revealed that neuropsychiatric development of nonsyndromic synostosis may be under genetic control. SMAD6 mutations led to poorer mathematics, performance intelligence quotient, full-scale intelligence quotient, and motor coordination, even after controlling for exogenous factors. Genetic testing may be critical for advocating early adjunctive neurodevelopmental therapy.\nRisk, II.", "Using artificial intelligence techniques, we compute optimal personalized protocols for temozolomide administration in a population of patients with variability.\nOur optimizations are based on a Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model with population variability for temozolomide, inspired by Faivre et al. [10] and Panetta et al. [25,26]. The patient pharmacokinetic parameters can only be partially observed at admission and are progressively learned by Bayesian inference during treatment. For every patient, we seek to minimize tumor size while avoiding severe toxicity, i.e. maintaining an acceptable toxicity level. The optimization algorithm we rely on borrows from the field of artificial intelligence.\nOptimal personalized protocols (OPP) achieve a sizable decrease in tumor size at the population level but also patient-wise. The tumor size is on average 67.2\u202fg lighter than with the standard maximum-tolerated dose protocol (MTD) after 336 days (12 MTD cycles). The corresponding 90% confidence interval for average tumor size reduction amounts to 58.6-82.7\u202fg. When treated with OPP, less patients experience severe toxicity in comparison to MTD.\nWe quantify in-silico the benefits offered by personalized oncology in the case of temozolomide administration. To do so, we compute optimal personalized protocols for a population of heterogeneous patients using artificial intelligence techniques. At each treatment day, the protocol is updated by taking into account the feedback obtained from patient's reaction to the drug administration. Personalized protocols greatly differ from each other, and from the standard MTD protocol. Benefits of personalization are very sizable: tumor sizes are much smaller on average and also patient-wise, while severe toxicity is made less frequent.", "Telemedicine is an essential support system for clinical settings outside the hospital. Recently, the importance of the model for assessment of telemedicine (MAST) has been emphasised. The development of an eHealth-supported wound assessment system using artificial intelligence is awaited. This study explored whether or not wound segmentation of a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) and a venous leg ulcer (VLU) by a convolutional neural network (CNN) was possible after being educated using sacral pressure ulcer (PU) data sets, and which CNN architecture was superior at segmentation.\nCNNs with different algorithms and architectures were prepared. The four architectures were SegNet, LinkNet, U-Net and U-Net with the VGG16 Encoder Pre-Trained on ImageNet (Unet_VGG16). Each CNN learned the supervised data of sacral pressure ulcers (PUs).\nAmong the four architectures, the best results were obtained with U-Net. U-Net demonstrated the second-highest accuracy in terms of the area under the curve (0.997) and a high specificity (0.943) and sensitivity (0.993), with the highest values obtained with Unet_VGG16. U-Net was also considered to be the most practical architecture and superior to the others in that the segmentation speed was faster than that of Unet_VGG16.\nThe U-Net CNN constructed using appropriately supervised data was capable of segmentation with high accuracy. These findings suggest that eHealth wound assessment using CNNs will be of practical use in the future.", "Both low intelligence and low emotional control have previously been linked to a higher risk of suicide, but it is unknown whether the associations apply consistently over the life course.\nThe study was based on data on intelligence and emotional control, collected from 48 738 Swedish men conscripted in 1969-1970, at ages 18-20 years. The data were linked to national registers giving information on subsequent suicidal behavior (completed and attempted suicide) up to the age of 59 years. The associations were investigated using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression models, with adjustment for childhood socioeconomic status.\nIntelligence and emotional control assessed in late adolescence both showed robust inverse associations with suicidal behavior over the 38-year follow-up. However, while the association between lower intelligence and higher rate of suicidal behavior remained the same throughout (~40% increased hazard per unit on a five-level scale), the association between lower emotional control and suicidal behavior was substantially stronger in early adulthood (~100% increased hazard per unit) than in late middle age (~30% increased hazard per unit).\nThe study adds to previous research by showing that the association between poor emotional control and subsequent suicide risk in men becomes weaker over the life course, while the association between low intelligence and suicide risk seems to be constant. The particularly high suicide risk of young men with poor emotional control may motivate targeted prevention efforts.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging is a potentially disruptive technology. An understanding of the principles and application of radiomics, artificial neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning is an essential foundation to weave design solutions that accommodate ethical and regulatory requirements, and to craft AI-based algorithms that enhance outcomes, quality, and efficiency. Moreover, a more holistic perspective of applications, opportunities, and challenges from a programmatic perspective contributes to ethical and sustainable implementation of AI solutions.", "The emergence and ongoing spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a major global public health threat. MDR has extensively combated the potency of antibiotics. Development of new antibiotics requires several years with prohibitive cost that will not last. An alternative solution is to recombine failed antibiotics, which has been proven to be not only cost-effective, but also potent. However, selection of the optimal combinations of these chemicals through conventional trial-and-error methods is challenging and slow, since M candidates with N doses lead to NM possible combinations. Herein, we present a artificial intelligence (AI) guided chemical combination optimization technique, namely Streamlined Rapid Identification of Combinatorial Therapies (STRICT), which is phenotype based and can efficiently learn and identify the optimal drug-combinations with minimal experimental efforts. With the guidance of STRICT, we successfully identified potent combinations of five antibiotics from 26 antibiotics that are individually ineffective at inhibiting an artificially induced strain of MDR bacteria. Rather than examine millions of tests, STRICT accomplished this task with only 120 carefully selected tests. Our results indicate that STRICT is a powerful platform to identify efficacious multiantibiotic combinations for the treatment of MDR bacteria. The AI-guided platform introduced here is an effective tool for drug repurposing, beneficial toward large-scale drug screening for other disease models, and also has a broad application in chemical combination optimization to deliver a desired end point for a complex system.", "Liver resection remains the best curative option for primary liver cancer, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In particular, in liver resection for HCC, anatomical resection of the tumor-bearing segments is highly recommended to eradicate the intrahepatic metastases spreading through portal venous branches. Anatomical liver resection, including anatomical segmentectomy and subsegmentectomy using the dye-injection method, is technically demanding and requires experience for completion of a precise procedure. The recent development of imaging studies and new computer technologies has allowed for the preoperative design of the operative procedure, intraoperative navigation, and postoperative quality evaluation of the anatomical liver resection. Although these new technologies are related to the progress of artificial intelligence, the actual operative procedure is still performed as human-hand work. A precise anatomical liver resection still requires meticulous exposure of the boundary of hepatic venous tributaries with deep knowledge of liver anatomy and utilization of intraoperative ultrasonography.", "This editorial summarizes selected key contributions of Prof. Stephen Grossberg and describes the papers in this 80th birthday special issue in his honor. His productivity, creativity, and vision would each be enough to mark a scientist of the first caliber. In combination, they have resulted in contributions that have changed the entire discipline of neural networks. Grossberg has been tremendously influential in engineering, dynamical systems, and artificial intelligence as well. Indeed, he has been one of the most important mentors and role models in my career, and has done so with extraordinary generosity and encouragement. All authors in this special issue have taken great pleasure in hereby commemorating his extraordinary career and contributions.", "The drive to survive is a biological universal. Intelligent behaviour is usually recognized when individual organisms including plants, in the face of fiercely competitive or adverse, real-world circumstances, change their behaviour to improve their probability of survival.\nThis article explains the potential relationship of intelligence to adaptability and emphasizes the need to recognize individual variation in intelligence showing it to be goal directed and thus being purposeful. Intelligent behaviour in single cells and microbes is frequently reported. Individual variation might be underpinned by a novel learning mechanism, described here in detail. The requirements for real-world circumstances are outlined, and the relationship to organic selection is indicated together with niche construction as a good example of intentional behaviour that should improve survival. Adaptability is important in crop development but the term may be complex incorporating numerous behavioural traits some of which are indicated.\nThere is real biological benefit to regarding plants as intelligent both from the fundamental issue of understanding plant life but also from providing a direction for fundamental future research and in crop breeding.", "This exploratory study is the first to investigate whether the construct of sluggish-cognitive tempo (SCT) is related to slowed processing speed in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI), while also considering pre-morbid and injury variables. The study evaluated SCT, as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and processing speed, as assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV Processing Speed Index), in children who sustained TBI with a wide range of injury severity. Injury variables examined included the length of coma, presence of neuroimaging findings, and time between injury and assessment. Children's cognitive reserve, as estimated by parental level of education, was a non-injury variable. The participants included 50 children, ages 6-16\u2009years, without co-morbid neurological or psychiatric conditions who underwent a neuropsychological evaluation within 1-12\u2009months after injury. Results indicated no significant correlations between SCT and any of the WISC-IV index scores. Children with a moderate-severe TBI did not differ from those with uncomplicated mild TBI on SCT but they had statistically significant lower WISC-IV Processing Speed. Although parents of children with uncomplicated mild TBI had higher levels of education as compared to parents of children with moderate-severe TBI, there was no statistically significant relationship between the level of parental education and either SCT or Processing Speed. This study suggests that SCT, as measured by the CBCL, is not a sensitive measure of sequelae of pediatric TBI.", "Thrombosis development in either arterial or venous system remains a major cause of death and disability worldwide. This poorly controlled in vivo clotting could result in many severe complications including myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, stroke, and cerebral venous thrombosis, to name a few. These conditions are collectively known as thromboembolic disorders (TEDs). Appropriate understanding of TEDs is challenging, as they are multifactorial and involve several and often different risk factors. Hence, it requires a collective effort and data from numerous research studies to fully comprehend molecular mechanisms for prediction, prevention, treatment, and overall management of these conditions. To accomplish this arduous feat, a comprehensive approach is required that can compile thousands of available experimental data and transform these into more applicable and purposeful findings. Thus, large datasets could be utilized to generate models that could be predictive of how an individual would respond when subjected to any kind of additional risk factors or surgery, hospitalization, etc., or in the presence of some susceptible genetic variations. Artificial intelligence-based methods harness the capabilities of computer software to imitate human behaviors such as language translation, visual perception, and, most importantly, decision making. These emerging tools, if appropriately explored, might assist in processing of large data and tackle the complexities of identifying novel or interesting pathways that could otherwise be hidden due to their enormity. This narrative review attempts to compile the applications of various subfields of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the context of thrombosis research to date. It further reflects on the potential of artificial intelligence in transforming enormous research data into translational application in the form of predictive computational models.", "This report summarizes topics discussed at the STR sequence nomenclature meeting hosted by the STRAND Working Group in April 2019. Invited attendees for this meeting included researchers known-to-us to be developing STR sequence-based nomenclature schemata, scientific representatives from vendors developing STR sequence bioinformatic methods, DNA intelligence database curators, and academic experts in STR genomics. The goal of this meeting was to provide a forum for individuals developing nomenclature schemata to present and discuss their ideas, encouraging mutual awareness, identification of differences in approaches, opposing aspects, and opportunities for parallelization while some approaches are still under development.", "The practice of medicine is changing with the development of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods of machine learning. Coupled with rapid improvements in computer processing, these AI-based systems are already improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and treatment across various specializations. The increasing focus of AI in radiology has led to some experts suggesting that someday AI may even replace radiologists. These suggestions raise the question of whether AI-based systems will eventually replace physicians in some specializations or will augment the role of physicians without actually replacing them. To assess the impact on physicians this research seeks to better understand this technology and how it is transforming medicine. To that end this paper researches the role of AI-based systems in performing medical work in specializations including radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, and cardiology. It concludes that AI-based systems will augment physicians and are unlikely to replace the traditional physician-patient relationship.", "This is a condensed summary of an international multisociety statement on ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology produced by the ACR, European Society of Radiology, RSNA, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine, European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine. AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future.

Both positive and negative aspects of the learning methods are presented.\nThe fundamental objectives of teaching and learning remain unchanged, yet the opportunities to reach larger audiences and integrate their learning into active experiences are evolving due to the introduction of new teaching and learning methodologies. The ability to reach a global audience has never been more apparent. Nevertheless, as much as new technology can be alluring, each new method comes with unique limitations.", "Acute stroke caused by large vessel occlusions (LVOs) requires emergent detection and treatment by endovascular thrombectomy. However, radiologic LVO detection and treatment is subject to variable delays and human expertise, resulting in morbidity. Imaging software using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), a branch of AI, may improve rapid frontline detection of LVO strokes. This report is a systematic review of AI in acute LVO stroke identification and triage, and characterizes LVO detection software.\nA systematic review of acute stroke diagnostic-focused AI studies from January 2014 to February 2019 in PubMed, Medline, and Embase using terms: 'artificial intelligence' or 'machine learning or deep learning' and 'ischemic stroke' or 'large vessel occlusion' was performed.\nVariations of AI, including ML methods of random forest learning (RFL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used to detect LVO strokes. Twenty studies were identified that use ML. Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) commonly used RFL, while LVO detection typically used CNNs. Image feature detection had greater sensitivity with CNN than with RFL, 85% versus 68%. However, AI algorithm performance metrics use different standards, precluding ideal objective comparison. Four current software platforms incorporate ML: Brainomix (greatest validation of AI for ASPECTS, uses CNNs to automatically detect LVOs), General Electric, iSchemaView (largest number of perfusion study validations for thrombectomy), and Viz.ai (uses CNNs to automatically detect LVOs, then automatically activates emergency stroke treatment systems).\nAI may improve LVO stroke detection and rapid triage necessary for expedited treatment. Standardization of performance assessment is needed in future studies.", "The last decade has transformed the field of artificial intelligence, with deep learning at the forefront of this development. With its ability to 'self-learn' discriminative patterns directly from data, deep learning is a promising computational approach for automating the classification of visual, spatial and acoustic information in the context of environmental conservation. Here, we first highlight the current and future applications of supervised deep learning in environmental conservation. Next, we describe a number of technical and implementation-related challenges that can potentially impede the real-world adoption of this technology in conservation programmes. Lastly, to mitigate these pitfalls, we discuss priorities for guiding future research and hope that these recommendations will help make this technology more accessible to environmental scientists and conservation practitioners.", "The purpose of this study was to explore whether children with autism display selectivity in social learning. We investigated the processing of word mappings provided by speakers who differed on previously demonstrated accuracy and on potential degree of reliability in three groups of children (children with autism spectrum disorder, children with developmental language disorder, and typically developing children) aged 4-9\u202fyears. In Task 1, one speaker consistently misnamed familiar objects and the second speaker consistently gave correct names. In Task 2, both speakers provided correct information but differed on how they could achieve this accuracy. We analyzed how the speakers' profiles influenced children's decisions to rely on them in order to learn novel words. We also examined how children attended to the speakers' testimony by tracking their eye movements and comparing children' gaze distribution across speakers' faces and objects of their choice. Results show that children rely on associative trait attribution heuristics to selectively learn from accurate speakers. In Task 1, children in all groups preferred the novel object selected by accurate speakers and directly avoided information provided by previously inaccurate speakers, as revealed by the eye-tracking data. In Task 2, where more sophisticated reasoning about speakers' reliability was required, only children in the typically developing group performed above chance. Nonverbal intelligence score emerged as a predictor of children's preference for more reliable informational sources. In addition, children with autism exhibited reduced attention to speakers' faces compared with children in the comparison groups.", "Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested that the neural bases of trait emotional intelligence (TEI) lie in the social cognition network (SCN) and the somatic marker circuitry (SMC). The current study was the first to investigate the associations of total TEI factors and subfactors with mean diffusivity (MD) of these networks as well as regional MD of the dopaminergic system (MDDS). We found that TEI intrapersonal factor score and total TEI score were negatively correlated with regional MDDS in the vicinity of the right putamen and right pallidum and that TEI intrapersonal factor score was negatively correlated with MD values of the fusiform gyrus. Total TEI score and TEI factor scores were positively correlated with MD values of various areas within or adjacent to SCN components, SMC structures and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). Our MD findings demonstrated the importance of the dopaminergic system to TEI and implicate the SCN, SMC and LPFC in TEI. Future studies are required to investigate the implications of positive and negative associations with MD values.", "Children's mathematical achievement depends on their domain-specific abilities and their domain-general skills such as executive functions (EFs) and visual-spatial skills (VSS). Research indicates that these two domain-general skills predict mathematical achievement. However, it is unclear whether these skills are differently associated with mathematical achievement across a large age range. The current cross-sectional study answered this question using a large, representative sample aged 5-20\u00a0years (N\u2009=\u20091754). EFs, VSS, and mathematical achievement were assessed using the Intelligence and Development Scales-2. Hierarchical regression analyses were computed with EFs and VSS as predictor variables and mathematical achievement as dependent variable. We examined (non-) linear effects and interactions of EFs and VSS with age. Results indicated that EFs and VSS were distinctly associated with mathematical achievement above and beyond effects of age, sex, maternal education, and verbal reasoning. Effects of EFs were linear and age-invariant. Effects of VSS were curvilinear and stronger in adolescents than in children. Our results indicated that EFs and VSS related differently to mathematical proficiency across age, suggesting a varying impact on mathematics across age.", "Aesthetic sensitivity has been defined as the ability to recognize and appreciate beauty and compositional excellence, and to judge artistic merit according to standards of aesthetic value. The Visual Aesthetic Sensitivity Test (VAST) has often been used to assess this ability, but recent research has revealed it has several psychometric problems. Such problems are not easily remedied, because they reflect flawed assumptions inherent to the concept of aesthetic sensitivity as traditionally understood, and to the VAST itself. We introduce a new conception of aesthetic sensitivity defined as the extent to which someone's aesthetic valuation is influenced by a given feature. Experiment 1 aimed to characterize aesthetic sensitivity to four prominent features in visual aesthetics: complexity, symmetry, contour, and balance. Experiment 2 aimed to replicate the findings of Experiment 1 and to assess the test-retest reliability of an instrument designed to measure aesthetic sensitivity to these features using an abridged set of stimuli. Our results reveal that people differ remarkably in the extent to which visual features influence their liking, highlighting the crucial role of individual variation when modelling aesthetic preferences. We did not find clear relations between the four measures of aesthetic sensitivity and personality, intelligence, and art interest and knowledge. Finally, our measurement instrument exhibited an adequate-to-good test-retest reliability.", "Children with the single-gene disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) appear to be at an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and exhibit a unique social-cognitive phenotype compared with children with idiopathic ASD. A complete framework is required to better understand autism in NF1, from neurobiological levels through to behavioural and functional outcomes. The primary aims of this study are to establish the frequency of ASD in children with NF1, examine the social cognitive phenotype, investigate the neuropsychological processes contributing to ASD symptoms and poor social functioning in children with NF1, and to investigate novel structural and functional neurobiological markers of ASD and social dysfunction in NF1. The secondary aim of this study is to compare the neuropsychological and neurobiological features of ASD in children with NF1 to a matched group of patients with idiopathic ASD.\nThis is an international, multisite, prospective, cross-sectional cohort study of children with NF1, idiopathic ASD and typically developing (TD) controls. Participants will be 200 children with NF1 (3-15 years of age), 70 TD participants (3-15 years) and 35 children with idiopathic ASD (7-15 years). Idiopathic ASD and NF1 cases will be matched on age, sex and intelligence. All participants will complete cognitive testing and parents will rate their child's behaviour on standardised questionnaires. Neuroimaging will be completed by a subset of participants aged 7\u2009years and older. Children with NF1 that screen at risk for ASD on the parent-rated Social Responsiveness Scale 2nd Edition will be invited back to complete the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale 2nd Edition and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised to determine whether they fulfil ASD diagnostic criteria.\nThis study has hospital ethics approval and the results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and international conferences.", "Bolstered by ever affordable computational power and open big datasets, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are bringing revolutionary changes to our lives. This article examines the current trends and elaborates the future potentials of AI in its role for making science more open and accessible. Based on the experience derived from a research project called Microsoft Academic, the advocates have reasons to be optimistic about the future of open science as the advanced discovery, ranking, and distribution technologies enabled by AI are offering strong incentives for scientists, funders and research managers to make research articles, data and software freely available and accessible.", "Working memory training research has produced mixed results in terms of finding benefits beyond the trained tasks (i.e., transfer). One potential limitation is that the research thus far has failed to isolate the specific combination of factors that makes working memory training work best. Individual differences in cognitive ability at pretest may be an important factor, suggesting possible aptitude-by-treatment interactions. Baseline cognitive ability could be (a) positively related, (b) negatively related, or (c) unrelated to training task improvements. The relationship between ability and training gains is important given the idea that larger training improvements should lead to greater transfer. However, the majority of training studies tend to be under-powered to examine individual differences. We pooled studies conducted in related labs to increase power while minimizing differences between studies. In the studies that were identified for this project, young adults completed complex span training and working memory and/or fluid intelligence as pretest measures. The combined samples from seven studies resulted in a sample of 192 participants. Analyses focused on the relationship between pretest cognitive ability and training performance across training days. There was no evidence that individuals lower in cognitive ability improved more than high-ability subjects on the training tasks. Instead, we found a positive relationship for both working memory and fluid intelligence measured at pretest with the amount of training improvement. In addition, the association between pretest working memory and working memory training performance appears to be domain-general - verbal and visuospatial content do not produce differential relationships.", "With the rapid development of medical imaging and intelligent diagnosis, artificial intelligence methods have become a research hotspot of radiography processing technology in recent years. The low definition of knee magnetic resonance image texture seriously affects the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis. This paper presents a super-resolution reconstruction method to address this problem.\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient medical image super-resolution (EMISR) method, in which we mainly adopted three hidden layers of super-resolution convolution neural network (SRCNN) and a sub-pixel convolution layer of efficient sub-pixel convolution neural network (ESPCN). The addition of the efficient sub-pixel convolutional layer in the hidden layer and the small network replacement consisting of concatenated convolutions to address low-resolution images but not high-resolution images are important. The EMISR method also uses cascaded small convolution kernels to improve reconstruction speed and deepen the convolution neural network to improve reconstruction quality.\nThe proposed method is tested in the public dataset IDI, and the reconstruction quality of the algorithm is higher than that of the sparse coding-based network (SCN) method, the SRCNN method, and the ESPCN method (+\u202f2.306\u202fdB, +\u202f2.540\u202fdB, +\u202f1.089\u202fdB improved); moreover, the reconstruction speed is faster than its counterparts (+\u202f4.272\u202fs, +\u202f1.967\u202fs, and +\u202f0.073\u202fs improved).\nThe experimental results show that our EMISR framework has improved performance and greatly reduces the number of parameters and training time. Furthermore, the reconstructed image presents more details, and the edges are more complete. Therefore, the EMISR technique provides a more powerful medical analysis in knee osteoarthritis examinations.", "There is a growing awareness that artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in the analysis of complicated and big data to provide outputs without human input in various health care contexts, such as bioinformatics, genomics, and image analysis. Although this technology can provide opportunities in diagnosis and treatment processes, there still may be challenges and pitfalls related to various safety concerns. To shed light on such opportunities and challenges, this article reviews AI in health care along with its implication for safety. To provide safer technology through AI, this study shows that safe design, safety reserves, safe fail, and procedural safeguards are key strategies, whereas cost, risk, and uncertainty should be identified for all potential technical systems. It is also suggested that clear guidance and protocols should be identified and shared with all stakeholders to develop and adopt safer AI applications in the health care context.", "The development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) to radiology requires an approach that encompasses a health system. The UK government and National Health Service (NHS) are creating an ecosystem to facilitate academic/industrial partnerships aimed at accelerating the creation of relevant and robust AI tools, which will improve the development and delivery of healthcare imaging. A series of recent initiatives are described, which will drive the development and adoption of AI in clinical imaging.", "We assessed cognitive function of female rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and analyze the determinants, with special focus on cerebrovascular morphology. Sixty methotrexate (MTX-) or biologic-treated RA patients and 39 healthy controls were included in a cross-sectional study. Smoking habits, alcohol intake and time spent in education were recorded. Standard measures were performed to assess cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MOCA; Trail Making Test, TMT; Victoria Stroop Test, VST; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, WAIS; Benton Visual Retention test, BVRT), depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAIT/S) and general health status (Short Form 36, SF-36). Mean disease activity (28-joint Disease Activity Score, mDAS28; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, mESR; C-reactive protein, mCRP) of the past 12\u00a0months was calculated; anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF) were assessed. Cerebral vascular lesions and atrophy, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and plaques, as well as median cerebral artery (MCA) circulatory reserve capacity (CRC) were assessed by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), carotid ultrasound and transcranial Doppler, respectively. Cognitive function tests showed impairment in RA vs controls. Biologic- vs MTX-treated subgroups differed in TMT-A. Correlations were identified between cognitive function and depression/anxiety tests. WAIS, STAIS, STAIT and BDI correlated with most SF-36 domains. Numerous cognitive tests correlated with age and lower education. Some also correlated with disease duration, mESR and mDAS28. Regarding vascular pathophysiology, cerebral vascular lesions were associated with VST-A, carotid plaques with multiple cognitive parameters, while MCA and CRC with MOCA, BVRT and BDI. RA patients have significant cognitive impairment. Cognitive dysfunction may occur together with or independently of depression/anxiety. Older patients and those with lower education are at higher risk to develop cognitive impairment. Cognitive screening might be a useful tool to identify subgroups to be further investigated for cerebrovascular pathologies.", "To date, various electronic devices have been strategically fabricated, and simultaneous realization of high electrical conductivity, sensing property, and heat-conducting property by a simple, efficient, and accurate approach is significant but still challenging. Here, cellulosic fiber supported 3D interconnected silver nanowire (AgNW) networks with hierarchical structures are rationally designed to achieve excellent electrical conductivity and superior thermal dispersion capability. In particular, thermal annealing at the junctions enables both phonon and electron transfer as well as impedes interfacial slippage. In the current study, the AgNW/cellulosic paper with the low Ag content (1.55 wt %) exhibits a low sheet resistance of 0.51 \u03a9 sq-1. More importantly, the AgNW/cellulosic paper-based flexible strain sensor has been reasonably developed, which can be applied to monitor various microstructural changes and human motions with high sensitivity and robust stability (fast response/relaxation time of \u223c100 ms and high stability >2000 bending-stretching cycles). The AgNW/cellulosic paper-based device also displays efficient thermal dispersion property, which offers exciting opportunities for thermal management application. Furthermore, the obtained hybrid paper exhibits superior heat dispersion capacity for thermal management devices. Overall, uniform dispersion and 3D interconnected junctions of AgNW among the fibers inside the cellulosic papers lead to the combination of high mechanical strength, highly efficient electrical conductivity, and ultrahigh heat dispersion property. The AgNW/cellulosic paper has promising potentials in the flexible and wearable sensing elements, thermal management materials, and artificial intelligence devices.", "Post-traumatic headache is common after pediatric traumatic brain injury and affects thousands of children every year, but little is known about how headache affects recovery after traumatic brain injury in other symptom domains. We aimed to determine the association between headache and other common symptoms after pediatric traumatic brain injury and explore whether subjective complaints of headache are associated with objective deficits on specialized neurocognitive testing. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children ages 3-19 years following traumatic brain injury with a completed Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) questionnaire. Post-traumatic headache was defined by a score more than 2 on the SCAT question for headache and define headache groups for comparison. In our cohort, we analyzed data from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition (WASI-II). Headache was reported in 40 (33%) patients presenting for post-traumatic brain injury care among 121 pediatric traumatic brain injury patients and did not differ by injury severity. Median total SCAT symptom score in the headache group was 5-fold higher compared to patients without headache (median 45.5 vs 9; P < .001). Significantly lower-scaled scores in color naming, matrix reasoning, letter sequencing, and letter switching were also found in the headache group (all P \u2264 .03). Our study shows that headache, as reported by patients on the SCAT, is associated with higher symptom scores in all other symptom domains, including sleep, mood, sensory, and cognitive. Headache was also associated with worse objective neurocognitive measures and may identify patients who could benefit from specialized follow-up care and management.", "This is a condensed summary of an international multisociety statement on ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology produced by the ACR, European Society of Radiology, RSNA, Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine, European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine. AI has great potential to increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good and should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain without those two attributes.", "Postlingually deafened adult cochlear implant (CI) users routinely display large individual differences in the ability to recognize and understand speech, especially in adverse listening conditions. Although individual differences have been linked to several sensory (''bottom-up'') and cognitive (''top-down'') factors, little is currently known about the relative contributions of these factors in high- and low-performing CI users.\nThe aim of the study was to investigate differences in sensory functioning and neurocognitive functioning between high- and low-performing CI users on the Perceptually Robust English Sentence Test Open-set (PRESTO), a high-variability sentence recognition test containing sentence materials produced by multiple male and female talkers with diverse regional accents.\nCI users with accuracy scores in the upper (HiPRESTO) or lower quartiles (LoPRESTO) on PRESTO in quiet completed a battery of behavioral tasks designed to assess spectral resolution and neurocognitive functioning.\nTwenty-one postlingually deafened adult CI users, with 11 HiPRESTO and 10 LoPRESTO participants.\nA discriminant analysis was carried out to determine the extent to which measures of spectral resolution and neurocognitive functioning discriminate HiPRESTO and LoPRESTO CI users. Auditory spectral resolution was measured using the Spectral-Temporally Modulated Ripple Test (SMRT). Neurocognitive functioning was assessed with visual measures of working memory (digit span), inhibitory control (Stroop), speed of lexical/phonological access (Test of Word Reading Efficiency), and nonverbal reasoning (Raven's Progressive Matrices).\nHiPRESTO and LoPRESTO CI users were discriminated primarily by performance on the SMRT and secondarily by the Raven's test. No other neurocognitive measures contributed substantially to the discriminant function.\nHigh- and low-performing CI users differed by spectral resolution and, to a lesser extent, nonverbal reasoning. These findings suggest that the extreme groups are determined by global factors of richness of sensory information and domain-general, nonverbal intelligence, rather than specific neurocognitive processing operations related to speech perception and spoken word recognition. Thus, although both bottom-up and top-down information contribute to speech recognition performance, low-performing CI users may not be sufficiently able to rely on neurocognitive skills specific to speech recognition to enhance processing of spectrally degraded input in adverse conditions involving high talker variability.", "Language abilities in early childhood show stability over time and play an important role in the development of other cognitive processes. Identifying modifiable environmental risk factors is important to informing prevention and early intervention efforts. Maternal verbal ability has been previously linked to child verbal ability. The current study examined whether maternal and child verbal abilities were linked indirectly through early childhood maternal responsiveness. Data come from a longitudinal birth cohort study. Participants included 133 mothers and their children recruited from maternity wards shortly after birth. Maternal verbal ability was measured using the Vocabulary subtest from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition (child age 8\u00a0months). Child verbal ability was assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (36\u00a0months). A latent maternal responsiveness variable was estimated using three developmentally sensitive indicators; one during infancy (child age 8\u00a0months) and two when children were 36\u00a0months. Results of a structural equation model indicated a significant indirect effect from maternal verbal abilities to child verbal abilities through maternal responsiveness. This indirect path was significant even after inclusion of another indirect path from maternal executive functioning to child verbal ability through maternal responsiveness (which was not significant). Future studies will benefit from experimental, genetically sensitive and/or cross-lagged designs to allow for conclusions related to directionality and causality. This body of research has implications for the study of the intergenerational transmission of verbal abilities and associated skills, behaviours and adaptive outcomes.", "The industry has adopted Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium standards for clinical trial data and the Food and Drug Administration electronic common technical document standard for documents for many years but still faces many challenges. The solutions based on these standards enable integration among solo systems, but the integration needs to be based on business requirements and provides the end-to-end intelligence for the business. The more standards are adopted, the more meaningful and timely metadata are needed to manage the change of the standards and need to be applied in the process. Automation that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning will be the next game changer in the industry to provide data with higher quality and more efficiency. This article discusses the challenges in managing standards adoption, potential approaches for automation through using robotic processes, artificial intelligence, and the maturity model for metadata-driven automation in clinical research.", "Similar to advancements gained from big data in genomics, security, internet of things, and e-commerce, the materials workflow could be made more efficient and prolific through advances in streamlining data sources, autonomous materials synthesis, rapid characterization, big data analytics, and self-learning algorithms. In electrochemical materials science, data sets are large, unstructured/heterogeneous, and difficult to process and analyze from a single data channel or platform. Computer-aided materials design together with advances in data mining, machine learning, and predictive analytics are expected to provide inexpensive and accelerated pathways towards tailor-made functionally optimized energy materials. Fundamental research in the field of electrochemical energy materials focuses primarily on complex interfacial phenomena and kinetic electrocatalytic processes. This perspective article critically assesses AI-driven modeling and computational approaches that are currently applied to those objects. An application-driven materials intelligence platform is introduced, and its functionalities are scrutinized considering the development of electrocatalyst materials for CO2 conversion as a use case.", "Artificial neural networks (ANNs), a popular path towards artificial intelligence, have experienced remarkable success via mature models, various benchmarks, open-source datasets, and powerful computing platforms. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), a category of promising models to mimic the neuronal dynamics of the brain, have gained much attention for brain inspired computing and been widely deployed on neuromorphic devices. However, for a long time, there are ongoing debates and skepticisms about the value of SNNs in practical applications. Except for the low power attribute benefit from the spike-driven processing, SNNs usually perform worse than ANNs especially in terms of the application accuracy. Recently, researchers attempt to address this issue by borrowing learning methodologies from ANNs, such as backpropagation, to train high-accuracy SNN models. The rapid progress in this domain continuously produces amazing results with ever-increasing network size, whose growing path seems similar to the development of deep learning. Although these ways endow SNNs the capability to approach the accuracy of ANNs, the natural superiorities of SNNs and the way to outperform ANNs are potentially lost due to the use of ANN-oriented workloads and simplistic evaluation metrics. In this paper, we take the visual recognition task as a case study to answer the questions of \"what workloads are ideal for SNNs and how to evaluate SNNs makes sense\". We design a series of contrast tests using different types of datasets (ANN-oriented and SNN-oriented), diverse processing models, signal conversion methods, and learning algorithms. We propose comprehensive metrics on the application accuracy and the cost of memory & compute to evaluate these models, and conduct extensive experiments. We evidence the fact that on ANN-oriented workloads, SNNs fail to beat their ANN counterparts; while on SNN-oriented workloads, SNNs can fully perform better. We further demonstrate that in SNNs there exists a trade-off between the application accuracy and the execution cost, which will be affected by the simulation time window and firing threshold. Based on these abundant analyses, we recommend the most suitable model for each scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work using systematical comparisons to explicitly reveal that the straightforward workload porting from ANNs to SNNs is unwise although many works are doing so and a comprehensive evaluation indeed matters. Finally, we highlight the urgent need to build a benchmarking framework for SNNs with broader tasks, datasets, and metrics.", "The aims of this study were to 1) assess the predictive value of psychological assessment at five years of age on the need for educational support in very preterm children, and 2) report the neuropsychological profile of very preterm children at eleven years of age and risk factors for poorer neuropsychological functions. A cohort of 167 very preterm children was included (birth weight\u00a0\u2264\u00a01500\u00a0g and/or gestational age < 32\u00a0weeks). At five years of age, intellectual functioning was assessed with Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised and neuropsychological performance with NEPSY II. At eleven years of age, neuropsychological functions were assessed using NEPSY II and data on educational support services collected using a questionnaire. Lower full-scale intelligence quotient and poorer performance in subtests inhibition, comprehension of instructions, memory for designs, visuomotor precision and design copying at five years of age were associated with a need for educational support. Neuropsychological performance at eleven years of age was overall within the average range but below the mean, with the poorest performance in tasks assessing visual memory and visuospatial functions. The results offer a novel perspective to timing and measures of follow-up of very preterm children, since they show that need for long-term educational support can be identified at five years of age. The findings also highlight the clinical value of psychological assessments including evaluation of both intellectual functioning and neuropsychological performance, covering detailed information about non-verbal functions, in the follow-up of very preterm children up to eleven years of age.", "The increased availability of GPS-enabled devices makes possible to collect location data for mining purposes and to develop mobility-based services (MBS). For most of the MBSs, determining interesting locations and frequent Points of Interest (POIs) is of paramount importance to study the semantic of places visited by an individual and the mobility patterns as a spatio-temporal phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses mobility-based services for on-device and individual-centered mobility understanding. Unlike existing approaches that use crowd data for cloud-assisted POI extraction, the proposed solution autonomously detects POIs and mobility events to incrementally construct a cognitive map (spatio-temporal model) of individual mobility suitable to constrained mobile platforms. In particular, we focus on detecting POIs and enter-exits events as the key to derive statistical properties for characterizing the dynamics of an individual's mobility. We show that the proposed spatio-temporal map effectively extracts core features from the user-POI interaction that are relevant for analytics such as mobility prediction. We also demonstrate how the obtained spatio-temporal model can be exploited to assess the relevance of daily mobility routines. This novel cognitive and on-line mobility modeling contributes toward the distributed intelligence of IoT connected devices without strongly compromising energy.", "The aim of this research was to evaluate if being involved in a programme that integrates physical, mental, and social activities could help to reduce the impacts of cerebral ageing on cognitive functions. Fifty healthy adults over 65\u00a0years of age and without cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group; subjects were equally divided by age, sex, schooling, physical health, mood, and social integration. For 6\u00a0months, the experimental group had biweekly meetings, participating in a multimodal approach based on a combination of simultaneous physical, mental, and social activities. At pre-test and post-test, both experimental and control subjects underwent a neuropsychological assessment, including tests to measure attention, verbal and spatial memory, language, constructional praxis, executive functions, processing speed, and intelligence. Furthermore, a visual analogue scale was used to examine well-being and mood states. Compared to the pre-test levels and the control subjects, the performance of subjects in the experimental group significantly improved in several neuropsychological tests, including attention, processing speed, memory, and executive functions, as well as mood state. Even in older subjects without cognitive impairments, a multimodal approach based on simultaneous physical, mental, and social activity can be a useful strategy that has beneficial effects on mood and cognition. The results suggest that an active lifestyle may protect against cognitive decline in ageing.", "Despite the importance of subjective well-being (SWB) for students' mental and physical health, there is a lack of longitudinal studies investigating the development of SWB in adolescents and what factors are associated with it over time. The present study seeks to shed further light on this question by investigating adolescents longitudinally. A sample of German academic tracks students (N = 476) from five schools were followed longitudinally over a time period of 30 months with four measurement points from Grade 11 to Grade 13. Alongside the longitudinal assessment of SWB (mood and life satisfaction), a range of other factors were also assessed at t1 including; demographic factors (sex, age, socio-economic status (HISEI)), intelligence, grades (report cards provided by the schools), personality (neuroticism, extraversion) and perceived parental expectations and support. Latent growth curve models were conducted to investigate the development of SWB and its correlates. On average, mood and life satisfaction improved at the end of mandatory schooling. However, students significantly differed in this pattern of change. Students' life satisfaction developed more positively if students had good grades at t1. Furthermore, even though introverted students started with lower life satisfaction at t1, extraverts' life showed greater increases over time. Changes in mood were associated with socio-economic background; the higher the HISEI the more positive the change. As social comparisons in school performance are almost inevitable, schools should intervene to buffer the influence of school grades on students' SWB.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based therapeutics, devices, and systems are vital innovations in cancer control; particularly, they allow for diagnosis, screening, precise estimation of survival, informing therapy selection, and scaling up treatment services in a timely manner.\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the global trends, patterns, and development of interdisciplinary landscapes in AI and cancer research.\nAn exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify research domains emerging from abstract contents. The Jaccard similarity index was utilized to identify the most frequently co-occurring terms. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used for classifying papers into corresponding topics.\nFrom 1991 to 2018, the number of studies examining the application of AI in cancer care has grown to 3555 papers covering therapeutics, capacities, and factors associated with outcomes. Topics with the highest volume of publications include (1) machine learning, (2) comparative effectiveness evaluation of AI-assisted medical therapies, and (3) AI-based prediction. Noticeably, this classification has revealed topics examining the incremental effectiveness of AI applications, the quality of life, and functioning of patients receiving these innovations. The growing research productivity and expansion of multidisciplinary approaches are largely driven by machine learning, artificial neural networks, and AI in various clinical practices.\nThe research landscapes show that the development of AI in cancer care is focused on not only improving prediction in cancer screening and AI-assisted therapeutics but also on improving other corresponding areas such as precision and personalized medicine and patient-reported outcomes.", "The rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation in healthcare is highlighting the importance of health data-driven\u00a0management\u00a0as a geostrategic lever. From this point of view, the progress made by the United States and China requires a strong European response to develop a responsible vision which adopts an approach aiming at the positive regulation of AI in healthcare.", "This research aimed to validate an Emotion Regulation Training program cultivating resilience, strengthening interpersonal communication, and enhancing emotional intelligence. A community sample of 104 participants were assigned to either an intervention (n\u2009=\u200951) or nonactive control (n\u2009=\u200953) group matched by age and gender. In addition, data were gathered via a cognitive performance test conducted pre- and postmeasurement in a subset of the larger sample (n\u2009=\u200919 intervention, n\u2009=\u200919 control). Results revealed reappraisal significantly increased in the intervention group, which was associated with a decrease in depressive symptomology, worry, and suppression, and a concurrent increase in overall mental well-being, supporting the validation of the Emotion Regulation Training program.", "Objectives The goal of this paper was first to review the contributions of Dr. Camille Laurin in the development of psychiatric services at Albert-Pr\u00e9vost, and more specifically the role he played in promoting psychoanalysis as a modality of thinking which informs the various therapeutic measures with psychic caring and therapeutic relationship as a main focus. Psychoanalysis and psychodynamic psychotherapy are currently taught; this teaching is informed by the contemporary challenges posed by the evidence-based medicine, the neuroscience and the recent technological developments in the field of communication. Methods In the first section of this article, a biographical research was completed. In the second section, a brief review of literature was conducted for each topic discussed. Results Dr. Camille Laurin played a major role in the development of psychoanalytic thinking at Albert-Pr\u00e9vost. His heritage is still alive, mainly in the different courses and training activities offered at the Psychotherapy Center of this institution. The efficacy of the psychodynamic psychotherapy as a treatment has now been confirmed for many years. Even if neuroscience and psychoanalysis are two totally different fields of investigation, each of those disciplines can benefit from an open dialogue. The development of new communication technologies and artificial intelligence could eventually modify the practice of psychotherapy. Conclusion Psychoanalysis in its basic theoretical tenets are still widely taught to psychiatric students who mostly apply its principles when they practice psychodynamic psychotherapy. Dr. Camille Laurin played a significant role in promoting this approach at Albert-Pr\u00e9vost and more generally at the Department of psychiatry and addictions of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.", "Previous research in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) suggests that visual episodic memory impairment may emerge before analogous verbal episodic memory impairment. The current study examined working memory (WM) test performance in MCI to assess whether patients present with greater visual versus verbal WM impairment. WM performance was also assessed in relation to hippocampal occupancy (HO), a ratio of hippocampal volume to ventricular dilation adjusted for demographic variables and intracranial volume.\nJak et\u00a0al. (2009) (The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 17, 368-375) and Edmonds, Delano-Wood, Galasko, Salmon, & Bondi (2015) (Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,\u00a047(1), 231-242) criteria classify patients into four groups: little to no cognitive impairment (non-MCI); subtle cognitive impairment (SCI); amnestic MCI (aMCI); and a combined mixed/dysexecutive MCI (mixed/dys MCI). WM was assessed using co-normed Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) Digit Span Backwards and Wechsler Memory Scale-IV (WMS-IV) Symbol Span Z-scores.\nBetween-group analyses found worse WMS-IV Symbol Span and WAIS-IV Digit Span Backwards performance for mixed/dys MCI compared to non-MCI patients. Within-group analyses found no differences for non-MCI patients; however, all other groups scored lower on WMS-IV Symbol Span than WAIS-IV Digit Span Backwards. Regression analysis with HO as the dependent variable was statistically significant for WMS-IV Symbol Span performance. WAIS-IV Digit Span Backwards performance failed to reach statistical significance.\nWorse WMS-IV Symbol Span performance was observed in patient groups with measurable neuropsychological impairment and better WMS-IV Symbol Span performance was associated with higher HO ratios. These results suggest that visual WM may be particularly sensitive to emergent illness compared to analogous verbal WM tests.", "The digital transformation is already under way in our health system. The deployment of\u00a0data-driven management\u00a0and artificial intelligence supports the transition towards treatment methods oriented more towards chronic diseases. Understanding the ethical issues associated with this transformation is a key priority for the future of our health system.", "The aim of the present study was to determine the lowest cut-off value for albuminuria levels, which can be used to detect diabetic kidney disease (DKD) using the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data for US adults were used, and participants were classified as having diabetes or prediabetes based on a self-report and physiological measures. The study dataset comprised 942 diabetes and 524 prediabetes samples. This study clarified the significance of the lower albuminuria (UACR) levels, which can detect DKD, using an artificial intelligence-based rule extraction approach. The diagnostic rules (15 concrete rules) for both samples were extracted using a recursive-rule eXtraction (Re-RX) algorithm with continuous attributes (continuous Re-RX) to discriminate between prediabetes and diabetes datasets. Continuous Re-RX showed high test accuracy (77.56%) and a large area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (75%), which derived the two cut-off values (6.1 mg/g Cr and 71.00 mg/g Cr) for the lower albuminuria level in the UACR to detect early development of DKD. The early cut-off values for normoalbuminuria (NA) and microalbuminuria (MA) will be determined to help detect CKD and DKD, and to detect diabetes before MA develop and to prevent diabetic complications.", "As the research on artificial intelligence booms, there is broad interest in brain-inspired computing using novel neuromorphic devices. The potential of various emerging materials and devices for neuromorphic computing has attracted extensive research efforts, leading to a large number of publications. Going forward, in order to better emulate the brain's functions, its relevant fundamentals, working mechanisms, and resultant behaviors need to be re-visited, better understood, and connected to electronics. A systematic overview of biological and artificial neural systems is given, along with their related critical mechanisms. Recent progress in neuromorphic devices is reviewed and, more importantly, the existing challenges are highlighted to hopefully shed light on future research directions.", "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our digital healthcare system is seen as a significant strategy to contain Australia's rising healthcare costs, support clinical decision making, manage chronic disease burden and support our ageing population. With the increasing roll-out of 'digital hospitals', electronic medical records, new data capture and analysis technologies, as well as a digitally enabled health consumer, the Australian healthcare workforce is required to become digitally literate to manage the significant changes in the healthcare landscape. To ensure that new innovations such as AI are inclusive of clinicians, an understanding of how the technology will impact the healthcare professions is imperative.\nIn order to explore the complex phenomenon of healthcare professionals' understanding and experiences of AI use in the delivery of healthcare, an integrative review inclusive of quantitative and qualitative studies was undertaken in June 2018.\nOne study met all inclusion criteria. This study was an observational study which used a questionnaire to measure healthcare professional's intrinsic motivation in adoption behaviour when using an artificially intelligent medical diagnosis support system (AIMDSS).\nThe study found that healthcare professionals were less likely to use AI in the delivery of healthcare if they did not trust the technology or understand how it was used to improve patient outcomes or the delivery of care which is specific to the healthcare setting. The perception that AI would replace them in the healthcare setting was not evident. This may be due to the fact that AI is not yet at the forefront of technology use in healthcare setting. More research is needed to examine the experiences and perceptions of healthcare professionals using AI in the delivery of healthcare.", "The information generated through drug profiling can be used to infer a common source between one or several seizures as well as drug trafficking routes to provide insights into drug markets. Although well established, it is time-consuming and ineffective to compare all drug profiles manually. In recent years, there has been a push to automate processes to enable a more efficient comparison of illicit drug specimens. Various chemometric methods have been employed to compare and interpret forensic case data promptly. The intelligence that is produced can be used by decision-makers to disrupt or reduce the impact of illicit drug markets. This review highlights the most common chemometric techniques used in drug profiling and more specifically, the most efficient comparison metrics and pattern recognition techniques outlined in the literature.", "Humans are fundamentally social beings, and the relationships we form with others are crucial for our well-being. Research across a variety of domains has established the association between a variety of interpersonal factors and health outcomes, including quality-of-life. However, there is a need for a more integrative, holistic analysis of these variables and how they relate to one another.\nUndergraduate students (n\u2009=\u20091456) from four universities across the United States completed self-report measures of their quality-of-life and a variety of interpersonal factors identified as important predictors across the literature. We examined zero-order correlations between these measures and quality-of-life, estimated a path model to look at unique variance accounted for by each, and finally used network analysis to examine the network of direct and indirect associations among these variables and quality-of-life.\nLoneliness had the strongest association with quality-of-life across all analyses. When examining the unique association between quality-of-life and each interpersonal variable, six remained statistically significant: loneliness, social support, social connectedness, emotional intelligence, intimacy with one's romantic partner, and empathic concern. These results were supported by the network model, which found direct associations between quality-of-life and these six variables as well as indirect associations with all other interpersonal variables in the model.\nResults from this research suggest that interpersonal factors in general, and loneliness in particular, are strongly associated with quality-of-life. Future research is needed to establish the direction of these effects and examine for whom these findings are generalizable.", "Access to otolaryngology is limited by lengthy wait lists and lack of specialists, especially in rural and remote areas. The objective of this study was to use an automated machine learning approach to build a computer vision algorithm for otoscopic diagnosis capable of greater accuracy than trained physicians. This algorithm could be used by primary care providers to facilitate timely referral, triage, and effective treatment.\nOtoscopic images were obtained from Google Images (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA), from open access repositories, and within otolaryngology clinics associated with our institution. After preprocessing, 1,366 unique images were uploaded to the Google Cloud Vision AutoML platform (Google Inc.) and annotated with one or more of 14 otologic diagnoses. A consensus set of labels for each otoscopic image was attained, and a multilabel classifier architecture algorithm was trained. The performance of the algorithm on an 89-image test set was compared to the performance of physicians from pediatrics, emergency medicine, otolaryngology, and family medicine.\nFor all diagnoses combined, the average precision (positive predictive value) of the algorithm was 90.9%, and the average recall (sensitivity) was 86.1%. The algorithm made 79 correct diagnoses with an accuracy of 88.7%. The average physician accuracy was 58.9%.\nWe have created a computer vision algorithm using automated machine learning that on average rivals the accuracy of the physicians we tested. Fourteen different otologic diagnoses were analyzed. The field of medicine will be changed dramatically by artificial intelligence within the next few decades, and physicians of all specialties must be prepared to guide that process.\nNA Laryngoscope, 130:1408-1413, 2020.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) are separate neurodevelopmental disorders that are both characterized by difficulties in social cognition and social functioning. Due to methodological confounds, the degree of similarity in social cognitive impairments across these two disorders is currently unknown. This study therefore conducted a comprehensive comparison of social cognitive ability in ASD and SCZ to aid efforts to develop optimized treatment programs.\nIn total, 101 individuals with ASD, 92 individuals with SCZ or schizoaffective disorder, and 101 typically developing (TD) controls, all with measured intelligence in the normal range and a mean age of 25.47 years, completed a large battery of psychometrically validated social cognitive assessments spanning the domains of emotion recognition, social perception, mental state attribution, and attributional style.\nBoth ASD and SCZ performed worse than TD controls, and very few differences were evident between the two clinical groups, with effect sizes (Cohen's d) ranging from 0.01 to 0.34. For those effects that did reach statistical significance, such as greater hostility in the SCZ group, controlling for symptom severity rendered them non-significant, suggesting that clinical distinctions may underlie these social cognitive differences. Additionally, the strength of the relationship between neurocognitive and social cognitive performance was of similar, moderate size for ASD and SCZ.\nFindings largely suggest comparable levels of social cognitive impairment in ASD and SCZ, which may support the use of existing social cognitive interventions across disorders. However, future work is needed to determine whether the mechanisms underlying these shared impairments are also similar or if these common behavioral profiles may emerge via different pathways.", "Robotic therapy is a useful method applied during rehabilitation of stroke patients (to regain motor functions). To ensure active participation of the patient, assistance-as-needed is provided during robotic training. However, most existing studies are based on a predetermined desired trajectory, which significantly limits the use of this method for more complex scenarios. In this paper, artificial intelligence (AI) agents are introduced to enhance the robot so that a knee exoskeleton can be autonomously controlled. A new assist-as-needed (AAN) method is proposed, where the subjects and agents cooperatively control movements. An electromyographic (EMG)-controlled knee exoskeleton with an interesting screen game is developed. Two different AI agents, modular pipeline and deep Q-network, are introduced; both can control the exoskeleton to play the screen game independently. The human-robot cooperative control is studied with two different assistant strategies, i.e., fixed assistant ratio and AAN. Eight healthy subjects participated in the initial experiment, and four assistant modes were studied. The game scores obtained by the two agents were significantly higher than those obtained by healthy subjects (EMG control), indicating that using the agents to assist stroke rehabilitation is possible. The AAN method demonstrated a better performance than the fixed assistant ratio method, indicated by the higher integral muscle activation level and participant score. Compared to a fully active control (EMG control) and fully fixed guidance (AI control), human-robot cooperative control had significantly higher integral muscle activation levels, i.e., the subjects were more involved and motivated during training. Using AI agents to power rehabilitation robots is a promising way to realize AAN rehabilitation.", "Objective: To assess whether CI programming by means of a software application using artificial intelligence (AI), FOX\u00ae, may improve cochlear implant (CI) performance. Patients: Two adult CI recipients who had mixed auditory results with their manual fitting were selected for an AI-assisted fitting. Even after 17 months CI experience and 19 manual fitting sessions, the first subject hadn't developed open set word recognition. The second subject, after 9 months of manual fitting, had developed good open set word recognition, but his scores remained poor at soft and loud presentation levels. Main outcome measure(s): Cochlear implant fitting parameters, pure tone thresholds, bisyllabic word recognition, phonemic discrimination scores and loudness scaling curves. Results: For subject 1, a first approach trying to optimize the home maps by means of AI-proposed adaptations was not successful whereas a second approach based on the use of Automaps (an AI approach based on universal, i.e. population based group statistics) during 3 months allowed the development of open set word recognition. For subject 2, the word recognition scores improved at soft and loud intensities with the AI suggestions. The AI-suggested modifications seem to be atypical. Conclusions: The two case studies illustrate that adults implanted with manual CI fitting may experience an improvement in their auditory results with AI-assisted fitting.", "The dropout rate of Chinese elementary school students after 2007 rose again. Little research to date has identified individual differences in pathways of academic engagement to discern those at risk of disengagement and dropout from schools, as well as the longitudinal linkages between cognitive beliefs with academic engagement.\nExamine the developmental trajectories of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural engagement, and assess relations between the implicit theory of intelligence and academic self-efficacy and the development of academic engagement.\nWe recruited 532, 450, and 415 elementary students to rate on self-report scales in April 2016 (T1), October 2016 (T2), and April 2017 (T3), respectively. Trajectories of academic engagement were analysed by using a multiple-process growth mixture model, and levels of entity theory of intelligence and academic self-efficacy between engagement groups were compared by using analysis of variance.\nWe categorized the students into four groups: persistent (71.24%), climbing (6.01%), descending (16.54%), and struggling engagement (6.20%) groups. Within each group, the levels of academic self-efficacy from T1 to T3 demonstrated a consistent trend with the engagement trajectory; the levels of the implicit theory of intelligence over time showed the reverse trend.\nAttention should be given more on the students from the descending and struggling groups. The implicit theory of intelligence and academic self-efficacy showed different longitudinal associations with engagement trajectories.", "People are often influenced by past costs in their current decision-making, thus succumbing to a well-known bias recognized as the sunk cost effect. A recent study showed that the sunk cost effect is attenuated in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the study only addressed one situation of utilization decision by focusing on the choice between similar attractive alternatives with different levels of sunk costs. Thus, it remains unclear how individuals with ASD behave under sunk costs in different types of decision situations, particularly progress decisions, in which the decision-maker allocates additional resources to an initially chosen alternative. The sunk cost effect in progress decisions was estimated using an economic task designed to assess the effect of the past investments on current decision-making. Twenty-four individuals with ASD and 21 age-, sex-, smoking status-, education-, and intelligence quotient-level-matched typical development (TD) subjects were evaluated. The TD participants were more willing to make the second incremental investment if a previous investment was made, indicating that their decisions were influenced by sunk costs. However, unlike the TD group, the rates of investments were not significantly increased after prior investments in the ASD group. The results agree with the previous evidence of a reduced sensitivity to context stimuli in individuals with ASD and help us obtain a broader picture of the impact of sunk costs on their decision-making. Our findings will contribute to a better understanding of ASD and may be useful in addressing practical implications of their socioeconomic behavior.", "The traditionally promulgated perspectives of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) as rare, indolent tumours are blunt and have been outdated for the last 2 decades. Clear increments in their incidence over the past decades render them increasingly clinically relevant, and at initial diagnosis many present with nodal and/or distant metastases (notably hepatic). The molecular pathogenesis of these tumours is increasingly yet incompletely understood. Those arising from the small bowel (SB) or pancreas typically occur sporadically; the latter may occur within the context of hereditary tumour predisposition syndromes. NENs can also be associated with endocrinopathy of hormonal hypersecretion. Tangible advances in the development of novel biomarkers, functional imaging modalities and therapy are especially applicable to this sub-set of tumours. The management of SB and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NET) may be challenging, and often comprises a multidisciplinary approach wherein surgical, medical, interventional radiological and radiotherapeutic modalities are implemented. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of SB and pancreatic NETs. Moreover, we provide an outlook of the future in these tumour types which will include the development of precision oncology frameworks for individualised therapy, multi-analyte predictive biomarkers, artificial intelligence-derived clinical decision support tools and elucidation of the role of the microbiome in NEN development and clinical behaviour.", "Over the last 15 years, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has progressively evolved to become an indispensable tool in cardiology. It is a non-invasive technique that enables objective and functional assessment of myocardial tissue. Recent innovations in magnetic resonance imaging scanner technology and parallel imaging techniques have facilitated the generation of T1 and T2 parametric mapping to explore tissue characteristics. The emergence of strain imaging has enabled cardiologists to evaluate cardiac function beyond conventional metrics. Significant progress in computer processing capabilities and cloud infrastructure has supported the growth of artificial intelligence in CMR imaging. In this review article, we describe recent advances in T1/T2 mapping, myocardial strain, and artificial intelligence in CMR imaging.", "To evaluate clinical and radiologic presentation, and neurologic outcome of pediatric posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).\nThe study included 24 children (14 males and 10 females) diagnosed with PRES who were prospectively followed for 2 years. They were evaluated using Wechsler Intelligence Scale, electroencephalograph (EEG), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nThe mean age of the studied patients at the time of diagnosis of PRES was 6 years (\u00b12.2). Chemotherapy for cancer represented 66.7% of the causes of PRES in the studied children, followed by renal disorders and immunosuppressive agents for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Twenty-seven attacks of PRES were reported as 3 children developed a second attack of PRES. Normal intelligence quotient was found in 95.8% of studied children after PRES. Residual abnormalities in follow-up MRI were demonstrated in 3 children. Epilepsy and residual MRI lesions were reported in 2 of the 3 children with recurrent PRES. Residual lesions in follow-up MRI and epilepsy were more significantly reported after recurrent PRES (P < .05).\nNeoplastic, renal disorders and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation represent the main disorders associated with PRES in children. Chemotherapeutic drugs, immunosuppressants, and hypertension are the main risk factors for pediatric PRES. The outcome of pediatric PRES is good, but long-term neurologic sequelae can occur, mainly epilepsy and residual MRI abnormalities. Recurrence of PRES is infrequently reported in children receiving chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive drugs. Recurrent PRES is a risk factor for long-term neurologic sequelae.", "Precise optical diagnosis of colorectal polyps could improve the cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy and reduce polypectomy-related complications. However, it is difficult for community-based non-experts to obtain sufficient diagnostic performance. Artificial intelligence-based systems have been developed to analyze endoscopic images; they identify neoplasms with high accuracy and low interobserver variation. We performed a multi-center study to determine the diagnostic accuracy of EndoBRAIN, an artificial intelligence-based system that analyzes cell nuclei, crypt structure, and microvessels in endoscopic images, in identification of colon neoplasms.\nThe EndoBRAIN system was initially trained using 69,142 endocytoscopic images, taken at 520-fold magnification, from patients with colorectal polyps who underwent endoscopy at 5 academic centers in Japan from October 2017 through March 2018. We performed a retrospective comparative analysis of the diagnostic performance of EndoBRAIN vs that of 30 endoscopists (20 trainees and 10 experts); the endoscopists assessed images from 100 cases produced via white-light microscopy, endocytoscopy with methylene blue staining, and endocytoscopy with narrow-band imaging. EndoBRAIN was used to assess endocytoscopic, but not white-light, images. The primary outcome was the accuracy of EndoBrain in distinguishing neoplasms from non-neoplasms, compared with that of endoscopists, using findings from pathology analysis as the reference standard.\nIn analysis of stained endocytoscopic images, EndoBRAIN identified colon lesions with 96.9% sensitivity (95% CI, 95.8%-97.8%), 100% specificity (95% CI, 99.6%-100%), 98% accuracy (95% CI, 97.3%-98.6%), a 100% positive-predictive value (95% CI, 99.8%-100%), and a 94.6% negative-predictive (95% CI, 92.7%-96.1%); these values were all significantly greater than those of the endoscopy trainees and experts. In analysis of narrow-band images, EndoBRAIN distinguished neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions with 96.9% sensitivity (95% CI, 95.8-97.8), 94.3% specificity (95% CI, 92.3-95.9), 96.0% accuracy (95% CI, 95.1-96.8), a 96.9% positive-predictive value, (95% CI, 95.8-97.8), and a 94.3% negative-predictive value (95% CI, 92.3-95.9); these values were all significantly higher than those of the endoscopy trainees, sensitivity and negative-predictive value were significantly higher but the other values are comparable to those of the experts.\nEndoBRAIN accurately differentiated neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions in stained endocytoscopic images and endocytoscopic narrow-band images, when pathology findings were used as the standard. This technology has been authorized for clinical use by the Japanese regulatory agency and should be used in endoscopic evaluation of small polyps more widespread clinical settings. UMIN clinical trial no: UMIN000028843.", "Computer technology is ubiquitous and relied upon in virtually all professional activities including neurosurgery, which is why it is surprising that it is not the case for orthopaedic surgery with fewer than 5% of surgeons using available computer technology in their procedures. In this review, we explore the evolution and background of Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS), delving into the basic principles behind the technology and the changes in the discussion on the subject throughout the years and the impact these discussions had on the field. We found evidence that industry had an important role in driving the discussion at least in knee arthroplasty-a leading field of CAOS-with the ratio between patents and publications increased from approximately 1:10 in 2004 to almost 1:3 in 2014. The adoption of CAOS is largely restrained by economics and ergonomics with sceptics challenging the accuracy and precision of navigation during the early years of CAOS moving to patient functional improvements and long term survivorship. Nevertheless, the future of CAOS remains positive with the prospect of new technologies such as improvements in image-guided surgery, enhanced navigation systems, robotics and artificial intelligence.", "Artificially intelligent tools have given us the capability to use technology to address ever more complex challenges. What are the capabilities, challenges, and hazards of incorporating and developing this technology for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)? Artificial Intelligence can be defined as the capability of a machine to imitate human intelligence. The goal of artificial intelligence is to create machines that can use characteristics of human intelligence to solve problems and adapt to a changing environment. Harnessing the capabilities of AI tools has the potential to accelerate progress in serving individuals with complex communication needs. In this article, we discuss components of AI, including: (a) knowledge representation, (b) reasoning, (c) natural language processing, (d) machine learning, (e) computer vision, and (f) robotics. For each AI component, we delve into the implications, promise, and precautions of that component for AAC.", "In this scientific report, a new technique of artificial intelligence which is based on k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), named as PSO-KNN, was developed and proposed for estimating blast-induced ground vibration (PPV). In the proposed PSO-KNN, the hyper-parameters of the KNN were searched and optimized by the PSO. Accordingly, three forms of kernel function of the KNN were used, Quartic (Q), Tri weight (T), and Cosine (C), which result in three models and abbreviated as PSO-KNN-Q, PSO-KNN-T, and PSO-KNN-C models. The valid of the proposed models was surveyed through comparing with those of benchmarks, random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and an empirical technique. A total of 152 blasting events were recorded and analyzed for this aim. Herein, maximum explosive per blast delay (W) and the distance of PPV measurement (R), were used as the two input parameters for predicting PPV. RMSE, R2, and MAE were utilized as performance indicators for evaluating the models' accuracy. The outcomes instruct that the PSO algorithm significantly improved the efficiency of the PSO-KNN-Q, PSO-KNN-T, and PSO-KNN-C models. Compared to the three benchmarks models (i.e., RF, SVR, and empirical), the PSO-KNN-T model (RMSE\u2009=\u20090.797, R2\u2009=\u20090.977, and MAE\u2009=\u20090.385) performed better; therefore, it can be introduced as a powerful tool, which can be used in practical blasting for reducing unwanted elements induced by PPV in surface mines.", "The purpose of this study was to develop a deep-learning framework for the diagnosis of chronic otitis media (COM) based on temporal bone computed tomography (CT) scans.\nA total of 562 COM patients with 672 temporal bone CT scans of both ears were included. The final dataset consisted of 1147 ears, and each of them was assigned with a ground truth label from one of the 3 conditions: normal, chronic suppurative otitis media, and cholesteatoma. A random selection of 85% dataset (n = 975) was used for training and validation. The framework contained two deep-learning networks with distinct functions: a region proposal network for extracting regions of interest from 2-dimensional CT slices; and a classification network for diagnosis of COM based on the extracted regions. The performance of this framework was evaluated on the remaining 15% dataset (n = 172) and compared with that of 6 clinical experts who read the same CT images only. The panel included 2 otologists, 3 otolaryngologists, and 1 radiologist.\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the artificial intelligence model in classifying COM versus normal was 0.92, with sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (91.4%) exceeding the averages of clinical experts (81.1% and 88.8%, respectively). In a 3-class classification task, this network had higher overall accuracy (76.7% versus 73.8%), higher recall rates in identifying chronic suppurative otitis media (75% versus 70%) and cholesteatoma (76% versus 53%) cases, and superior consistency in duplicated cases (100% versus 81%) compared with clinical experts.\nThis article presented a deep-learning framework that automatically extracted the region of interest from two-dimensional temporal bone CT slices and made diagnosis of COM. The performance of this model was comparable and, in some cases, superior to that of clinical experts. These results implied a promising prospect for clinical application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of COM based on CT images.", "The incorporation of telemedicine and artificial intelligence for early screening and assessment of severity of life-style disorders has a great potential for better assessment in a busy outpatient clinic and thereby curtail down the related morbidities. A computer based algorithm based upon standardized questionnaire (from established assessment tools) is designed to assess the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). In addition the incorporation of basic screening questions of anamnesis help in suggesting a probable diagnosis of sleep related disorder as well. The overall data at our center has been analyzed to establish the existing pattern of sleep related disorders. Of 850 healthy subjects screened, prevalence of snoring was 20.47% while OSAS was seen in 4.20% (N\u2009=\u200925) in males and 2.64% (N\u2009=\u20098) in females. The parasomnia was most prevalent (14.71%), followed by insomnia (10.24%), periodic leg movement (6.59%), bruxism (1.65%) and narcolepsy (0.59%). Hypertension, laryngopharyngeal reflux and obesity were the common co-morbidities in OSAS while family history of hypertension and diabetes were common in snorers. A significant association with OSA was seen with diabetes mellitus, neck circumference and nasal obstruction, while, obesity and apnoeic episodes were more significantly associated with OSA than snorers. Increased waist to hip ratio was appreciated in both the OSAS and snorers. The algorithm based online assessment is likely to diagnose the occult clinical cases as well as assess the risk of OSAS. In routine outpatient clinic, a clinician may better assess the patient morbidity with a comprehensive availability of symptoms and moreover enhance the post-treatment compliance. In addition a smartphone based computerized assessment for general population may be designed for other lifestyle disorders as well.", "The aim of this position paper is to provide a brief overview of the current status of cardiovascular modelling and of the processes required and some of the challenges to be addressed to see wider exploitation in both personal health management and clinical practice. In most branches of engineering the concept of the digital twin, informed by extensive and continuous monitoring and coupled with robust data assimilation and simulation techniques, is gaining traction: the Gartner Group listed it as one of the top ten digital trends in 2018. The cardiovascular modelling community is starting to develop a much more systematic approach to the combination of physics, mathematics, control theory, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science and advanced engineering methodology, as well as working more closely with the clinical community to better understand and exploit physiological measurements, and indeed to develop jointly better measurement protocols informed by model-based understanding. Developments in physiological modelling, model personalisation, model outcome uncertainty, and the role of models in clinical decision support are addressed and 'where-next' steps and challenges discussed.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly being extended across health systems with multiple cases of its use already reported. The most operational technique is machine learning with image recognition in imaging. Solutions derived from this approach, as well as other applications of AI, are presented in two major fields: cancer management and geriatric care.", "As more artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced mammography screening tools enter the clinical market, greater focus will be placed on external validation in diverse patient populations. In this viewpoint, we outline lessons learned from prior efforts in this field, the need to validate algorithms on newer screening technologies and diverse patient populations, and conclude by discussing the need for a framework for continuous monitoring and recalibration of these AI tools. Sufficient validation and continuous monitoring of emerging AI tools for breast cancer screening will require greater stakeholder engagement and the creation of shared policies and guidelines.", "Schizotypy, a putative schizophrenia endophenotype, has been associated with brain-structural variations partly overlapping with those in psychotic disorders. Variations in precuneus structure have been repeatedly reported, whereas the involvement of fronto-striatal networks - as in schizophrenia - is less clear. While shared genetic architecture is thought to increase vulnerability to environmental insults, beneficial factors like general intelligence might buffer their effect.\nTo further investigate the role of fronto-striatal networks in schizotypy, we examined the relationship of voxel- and surface-based brain morphometry and a measure of schizotypal traits (Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, with subscores Cognitive-Perceptual, Interpersonal, Disorganised) in 115 healthy participants [54 female, mean age (s.d.) = 27.57(8.02)]. We tested intelligence (MWT-B) as a potential moderator.\nWe found a positive association of SPQ Cognitive-Perceptual with putamen volume (p = 0.040, FWE peak level-corrected), moderated by intelligence: with increasing IQ, the correlation of SPQ Cognitive-Perceptual and striatal volume decreased (p = 0.022). SPQ Disorganised was positively correlated with precentral volume (p = 0.013, FWE peak level-corrected). In an exploratory analysis (p < 0.001, uncorrected), SPQ total score was positively associated with gyrification in the precuneus and postcentral gyrus, and SPQ Disorganised was negatively associated with gyrification in the inferior frontal gyrus.\nOur findings support the role of fronto-striatal networks for schizotypal features in healthy individuals, and suggest that these are influenced by buffering factors like intelligence. We conclude that protective factors, like general cognitive capacity, might attenuate the psychosis risk associated with schizotypy. These results endorse the idea of a continuous nature of schizotypy, mirroring similar findings in schizophrenia.", "Industrial robots are a strategic future technology and an important part of the development of artificial intelligence, and they are a necessary means for the intelligent transformation of manufacturing industry. Based on global industrial robot trade data from 1998 to 2017, this paper applies the dynamic complex network analysis method to reveal the spatial and temporal variation characteristics and trade status evolution of the global industrial robot trade network. The results show that the global industrial robot network density has steadily increased, and the industrial robot trade has been characterized by 'diversification'. The number of major industrial robot exporters in the world is increasing, and the import market is increasingly diversified. The export market structure is relatively tight, the centrality of the global industrial robot trade network shows a downward trend, and the dissimilarity of the 'core-edge' clusters decreases year by year. The trade status of 'catch-up' countries represented by China has rapidly increased. However, Japan, Germany, and Italy are still in the central position of the industrial robot trade. Moreover, trade of the 'catch-up' countries' is dominated by imports, and exports of industrial robot products are insufficient. Finally, policy suggestions are provided according to the results.", "Using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in different medical fields, especially emergency medicine is rapidly growing. In this paper, studies conducted in the recent years on using artificial intelligence in emergency medicine have been collected and assessed. These studies belonged to three categories: prediction and detection of disease; prediction of need for admission, discharge and also mortality; and machine learning based triage systems. In each of these categories, the most important studies have been chosen and accuracy and results of the algorithms have been briefly evaluated by mentioning machine learning techniques and used datasets.", "Recent decades have witnessed the genesis and progressive application of intelligent machines and computer programs that have the ability to process information and execute cognitive functions similar to those of human logic and reasoning such as problem solving and decision making. That is artificial intelligence (AI) in a nutshell as envisioned by John McCarthy, \"the father of AI\". Healthcare has welcomed AI, giving rise to collaborations such as the Moorfields Eye Hospital and Google's DeepMind division in the screening and predicting of retinal disease. The use of AI by the maxillofacial surgical fraternity is, however, limited. We wish to highlight the fact that surgeons are uniquely positioned to help drive these innovations rather than passively waiting for the technology to become useful.", "Acute appendicitis is one of the major causes for emergency surgery in childhood and adolescence. Appendectomy is still the therapy of choice, but conservative strategies are increasingly being studied for uncomplicated inflammation. Diagnosis of acute appendicitis remains challenging, especially due to the frequently unspecific clinical picture. Inflammatory blood markers and imaging methods like ultrasound are limited as they have to be interpreted by experts and still do not offer sufficient diagnostic certainty. This study presents a method for automatic diagnosis of appendicitis as well as the differentiation between complicated and uncomplicated inflammation using values/parameters which are routinely and unbiasedly obtained for each patient with suspected appendicitis. We analyzed full blood counts, c-reactive protein (CRP) and appendiceal diameters in ultrasound investigations corresponding to children and adolescents aged 0-17 years from a hospital based population in Berlin, Germany. A total of 590 patients (473 patients with appendicitis in histopathology and 117 with negative histopathological findings) were analyzed retrospectively with modern algorithms from machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). The discovery of informative parameters (biomarker signatures) and training of the classification model were done with a maximum of 35% of the patients. The remaining minimum 65% of patients were used for validation. At clinical relevant cut-off points the accuracy of the biomarker signature for diagnosis of appendicitis was 90% (93% sensitivity, 67% specificity), while the accuracy to correctly identify complicated inflammation was 51% (95% sensitivity, 33% specificity) on validation data. Such a test would be capable to prevent two out of three patients without appendicitis from useless surgery as well as one out of three patients with uncomplicated appendicitis. The presented method has the potential to change today's therapeutic approach for appendicitis and demonstrates the capability of algorithms from AI and ML to significantly improve diagnostics even based on routine diagnostic parameters.", "Making sense of the external world is vital for multiple domains of cognition, and so it is crucial that object recognition is maintained across the lifespan. We investigated age differences in perceptual and conceptual processing of visual objects in a population-derived sample of 85 healthy adults (24-87 years old) by relating measures of object processing to cognition across the lifespan. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded during a picture naming task to provide a direct measure of neural activity, that is not confounded by age-related vascular changes. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate neural responsivity for each individual, namely the capacity to represent visual or semantic information relating to the pictures. We find that the capacity to represent semantic information is linked to higher naming accuracy, a measure of task-specific performance. In mature adults, the capacity to represent semantic information also correlated with higher levels of fluid intelligence, reflecting domain-general performance. In contrast, the latency of visual processing did not relate to measures of cognition. These results indicate that neural responsivity measures relate to naming accuracy and fluid intelligence. We propose that maintaining neural responsivity in older age confers benefits in task-related and domain-general cognitive processes, supporting the brain maintenance view of healthy cognitive ageing.", "Research has suggested that individuals who play a musical instrument throughout adulthood have better preserved executive function. However, mixed results have been found for associations between musical activity and visuo-spatial abilities, and less is known about associations with fluid intelligence. We explored differences between musicians (N\u00a0=\u00a030) and non-musicians (N\u00a0=\u00a030) aged 60-93\u00a0years old across a range of neuropsychological measures of cognitive function. Musicians performed significantly better than non-musicians on all domains, which remained after adjusting for age, gender, educational history, languages spoken and physical activity. As a cross-sectional comparison, the results should not be overstated; however, they are consistent with findings suggesting learning a musical instrument throughout the life course may be associated with cognitive benefits. Identifying potential lifestyle factors that have cognitive benefits in later life, such as musical experience, is an important step in developing intervention strategies for cognitive aging.", "Stochastic mechanistic epidemiological models largely contribute to better understand pathogen emergence and spread, and assess control strategies at various scales (from within-host to transnational scale). However, developing realistic models which involve multi-disciplinary knowledge integration faces three major challenges in predictive epidemiology: lack of readability once translated into simulation code, low reproducibility and reusability, and long development time compared to outbreak time scale. We introduce here EMULSION, an artificial intelligence-based software intended to address those issues and help modellers focus on model design rather than programming. EMULSION defines a domain-specific language to make all components of an epidemiological model (structure, processes, parameters\u2026) explicit as a structured text file. This file is readable by scientists from other fields (epidemiologists, biologists, economists), who can contribute to validate or revise assumptions at any stage of model development. It is then automatically processed by EMULSION generic simulation engine, preventing any discrepancy between model description and implementation. The modelling language and simulation architecture both rely on the combination of advanced artificial intelligence methods (knowledge representation and multi-level agent-based simulation), allowing several modelling paradigms (from compartment- to individual-based models) at several scales (up to metapopulation). The flexibility of EMULSION and its capability to support iterative modelling are illustrated here through examples of progressive complexity, including late revisions of core model assumptions. EMULSION is also currently used to model the spread of several diseases in real pathosystems. EMULSION provides a command-line tool for checking models, producing model diagrams, running simulations, and plotting outputs. Written in Python 3, EMULSION runs on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. It is released under Apache-2.0 license. A comprehensive documentation with installation instructions, a tutorial and many examples are available from: https://sourcesup.renater.fr/www/emulsion-public.", "Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are the two most common neurodevelopmental disorders observed in childhood. The DSM-5 accepts a combined diagnosis of ADHD and ASD, while the DSM-IV did not. The aim of this study was to identify and evaluate the adaptive profile of children and adolescents with a diagnosis of comorbid ADHD and ASD, in comparison with adaptive functioning in subjects with a diagnosis of only ASD or ADHD. Materials and Methods: Ninety-one children (77 boys, 14 girls), aging from 3.1 to 13.4 years (mean age: 8.3 \u00b1 7.2), who met the criteria for a diagnosis of ASD and/or ADHD were enrolled. A neuropsychological evaluation involving cognitive and adaptive assessment was conducted using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Second Edition (ADOS-2), the Conners' Parent Rating Scale - Revised: Long Version (CPRS-R), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition or the Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales - Extended Revised, the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale - Second Edition (VABS-II). Conclusion: As to the adaptive skills in the three groups evaluated, a worse general profile was ascertained in the ASD and in ASD plus ADHD groups in comparison with respect to the ADHD-only group. With VABS-II evaluation, we found significant differences among the three groups across all domains and combined scores: Communication (F = 18.960; p < 0.001), Socialization (F = 25.410; p < 0.001), Daily Living Skills (F = 19.760; p < 0.001), Motor (F = 9.615; p < 0.001), and Adaptive behavior composite [ABC] (F = 29.370; p < 0.001). Implications of neurodevelopmental double diagnosis such as ASD plus ADHD are discussed.", "Knowledge of intelligence is essential for interpreting cognitive performance following traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Test of Premorbid Functioning (ToPF), a word reading test co-normed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 4th Edition (WAIS-IV), was examined as a tool for estimating premorbid intelligence in persons with a history of TBI. Fifty-two participants with mild, moderate, or severe TBI were administered the ToPF and WAIS-IV between two weeks and 19\u2009months post-injury. The independent ability of the ToPF/demographic score and the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) to predict WAIS-IV Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) was examined, as were discrepancies between ToPF and WAIS-IV scores within and between participants. The ToPF/demographic predicted FSIQ accounted for a significant proportion of variability in actual FSIQ, above and beyond that accounted for by education or time since injury. ToPF and WAIS-IV scores did not differ by injury severity. In our sample, the ToPF/demographic predicted FSIQ underestimated intelligence in a substantial portion of our participants (31%), particularly in those with high average to superior intelligence. Finally, VCI scores were more predictive of actual FSIQ than the ToPF/demographic predicted FSIQ. The ToPF frequently underestimated post-injury intelligence and is therefore not accurately measuring premorbid intelligence in our sample, particularly in those with above average to superior intelligence. Clinicians are encouraged to administer the entire WAIS-IV, or at minimum the VCI subtests, for a more accurate measure of intelligence in those with above average intelligence and history of TBI.", "To date, numbers of studies have indicated the important role of fine manual dexterity in typical and special populations. However, the relevant studies in Down's syndrome (DS) population is still limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the determinants of manual dexterity in adolescents and young adults with DS.\nThirty participants with DS (22 males, 8 females, aged 13-31) were screened by anthropometric variables (i.e. sex, chronological age, verbal intelligence, body mass index), levels of physical activity, and sleep disorders, and were administered the Purdue Pegboard Test and the Choice Reaction Time Test. Measures of correlation, t-test and multiple regression model were used for data analysis.\nIt was indicated that sex and sleep-related disorders during the day explained 37.2% of the variance in the performance of the Purdue Pegboard Test. The additional of 9.7% can be explained the variance by adding reaction time test performance. Verbal intelligence had the negatively relation with the performance of non-Dominant Hand and Bimanual subtests of the Purdue Pegboard Test.\nThis study suggested that sex, sleep disorder, and neuromotor function may be the important determinants of fine manual dexterity performance in adolescents and young adults with DS. In addition, the level of intelligence might also exert the effect on fine motor development in this population. In order to design effective interventions and optimize manual performance in individuals with DS, these possible determinants should be considered. Future research should be replicated with large sample size, different age groups, and validated measures of finger size, physical activity and sleep behaviors.", "Mapping the structure of the mammalian brain at cellular resolution is a challenging task and one that requires capturing key anatomical features at the appropriate level of analysis. Although neuroscientific methods have managed to provide significant insights at the micro and macro level, in order to obtain a whole-brain analysis at a cellular resolution requires a meso-scopic approach. A number of methods can be currently used to detect and count cells, with, nevertheless, significant limitations when analyzing data of high complexity. To overcome some of these constraints, we introduce a fully automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based method for whole-brain image processing to Detect Neurons in different brain Regions during Development (DeNeRD). We demonstrate a high performance of our deep neural network in detecting neurons labeled with different genetic markers in a range of imaging planes and imaging modalities.", "Although computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is widely used in mammography, conventional CAD programs that use prompts to indicate potential cancers on the mammograms have not led to an improvement in diagnostic accuracy. Because of the advances in machine learning, especially with use of deep (multilayered) convolutional neural networks, artificial intelligence has undergone a transformation that has improved the quality of the predictions of the models. Recently, such deep learning algorithms have been applied to mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). In this review, the authors explain how deep learning works in the context of mammography and DBT and define the important technical challenges. Subsequently, they discuss the current status and future perspectives of artificial intelligence-based clinical applications for mammography, DBT, and radiomics. Available algorithms are advanced and approach the performance of radiologists-especially for cancer detection and risk prediction at mammography. However, clinical validation is largely lacking, and it is not clear how the power of deep learning should be used to optimize practice. Further development of deep learning models is necessary for DBT, and this requires collection of larger databases. It is expected that deep learning will eventually have an important role in DBT, including the generation of synthetic images.", "Nanoparticle bioreactivity critically depends upon interaction between proteins and nanomaterials (NM). The formation of the \"protein corona\" (PC) is the effect of such nanoprotein interactions. PC has a wide usage in pharmaceuticals, drug delivery, medicine, and industrial biotechnology. Therefore, a detailed in-vitro, in-vivo, and in-silico understanding of nanoprotein interaction is fundamental and has a genuine contemporary appeal. NM surfaces can modify the protein conformation during interaction, or NMs themselves can lead to self-aggregations. Both phenomena can change the whole downstream bioreactivity of the concerned nanosystem. The main aim of this review is to understand the mechanistic view of NM-protein interaction and recapitulate the underlying physical chemistry behind the formation of such complicated macromolecular assemblies, to provide a critical overview of the different models describing NM induced structural and functional modification of proteins. The review also attempts to point out the current limitation in understanding the field and highlights the future scopes, involving a plausible proposition of how artificial intelligence could be aided to explore such systems for the prediction and directed design of the desired NM-protein interactions.", "The continuous development of electron devices towards the trend of \"More than Moore\" requires functional diversification that can collect data (sensors) and store (memories) and process (computing units) information. Considering the large occupation proportion of image data in both data center and edge devices, a device integration with optical sensing and data storage and processing is highly demanded for future energy-efficient and miniaturized electronic system. Two-dimensional (2D) materials and their heterostructures have exhibited broadband photoresponse and high photoresponsivity in the configuration of optical sensors and showed fast switching speed, multi-bit data storage, and large ON/OFF ratio in memory devices. In addition, its ultrathin body thickness and transfer process at low temperature allow 2D materials to be heterogeneously integrated with other existing materials system. In this paper, we overview the state-of-the-art optoelectronic random-access memories (ORAMs) based on 2D materials, as well as ORAM synaptic devices and their applications in neural network and image processing. The ORAM devices potentially enable direct storage/processing of sensory data from external environment. We also provide perspectives on possible directions of other neuromorphic sensor design (e.g., auditory and olfactory) based on 2D materials towards the future smart electronic systems for artificial intelligence.", "Stereotypies are frequently reported in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but remain one of the less explained phenomena. We aimed to describe, through a systematic review and a meta-analysis, the prevalence of motor stereotypies in ASD and study the factors that influence this prevalence. Our literature search included MEDLINE, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases. Quality and risk of bias were assessed. Thirty-seven studies were included and the median prevalence of motor stereotypies in ASD was 51.8%, ranging from 21.9% to 97.5%. The most frequent determinants associated with a higher number of stereotypies in ASD were a younger age, lower intelligence quotient, and a greater severity of ASD. Moreover, gender did not seem to influence the prevalence of stereotypies. Meta-analytic analysis showed that lower IQ and autism diagnosis (independent of IQ) are associated with a higher prevalence of motor stereotypies (odds ratio = 2.5 and 4.7, respectively). Limitations of the reviewed literature include the use of convenience samples, with small sizes and heterogeneous inclusion criteria, and the predominance of high-functioning autism individuals.", "When a cognitive ability is assessed repeatedly, test scores and ability estimates are often observed to increase across test sessions. This phenomenon is known as the retest (or practice) effect. One explanation for retest effects is that situational test anxiety interferes with a testee's performance during earlier test sessions, thereby creating systematic measurement bias on the test items (interference hypothesis). Yet, the influence of anxiety diminishes with test repetitions. This explanation is controversial, since the presence of measurement bias during earlier measurement occasions cannot always be confirmed. It is argued that people from the lower end of the ability spectrum become aware of their deficits in test situations and therefore report higher anxiety (deficit hypothesis). In 2014, a structural equation model was proposed that specifically allows the comparison of these two hypotheses with regard to explanatory power for the negative anxiety-ability correlation found in cross-sectional assessments. We extended this model for usage in longitudinal studies to investigate the impact of test anxiety on test performance and on retest effects. A latent neighbor-change growth curve was implemented into the model that enables an estimation of retest effects between all pairs of successive test sessions. Systematic restrictions on model parameters allow testing the hypothetical reduction in anxiety interference over the test sessions, which can be compared to retest effect sizes. In an empirical study with seven measurement occasions, we found that a substantial reduction in interference upon the second test session was associated with the largest retest effect in a figural matrices test, which served as a proxy measure for general intelligence. However, smaller retest effects occurred up to the fourth test administration, whereas evidence for anxiety-induced measurement bias was only produced for the first two test sessions. Anxiety and ability were not negatively correlated at any time when the interference effects were controlled for. Implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed.", "Ambient intelligence is a new paradigm in the Internet of Things (IoT) world that brings smartness to living environments to make them more sensitive; adaptive; and personalized to human needs. A critical area where ambient intelligence can be used is health and social care; where it can improve and sustain the quality of life without increasing financial costs. The adoption of this new paradigm for health and social care largely depends on the technology deployed (sensors and wireless networks), the software used for decision-making and the security, privacy and reliability of the information. IoT sensors and wearables collect sensitive data and must respond in a near real-time manner to input changes. An IoT security framework is meant to offer the versatility and modularization needed to sustain such applications. Our framework was designed to easily integrate with different health and social care applications, separating security tasks from functional ones and being designed with independent modules for each layer (Cloud, gateway and IoT device), that offer functionalities relative to that layer.", "Academic learning is the main source of stress among adolescents and is associated with mental health problems; finding its determinants helps to know the risk factors that influence stress.\nThe main aim of the study was to assess the educational stress and their predictors among adolescent girls.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted in ten colleges involving adolescent girls pursuing preuniversity and university studies at Dharwad city, India.\nThe study included 314 randomly selected adolescent girls aged between 16 and 19 years. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Data were collected by employing random sampling technique. Self-administered questionnaires were administered which included sociodemographic data sheet, personality inventory, intelligence quotient (IQ) assessment, and educational stress scale for adolescents.\nMean educational stress was 50.04 \u00b1 10.82 (range 16-80). There was a significant association between educational stress and religion, father education, number of siblings, combination of subjects, type of personality, and IQ. Regression analysis revealed that number of siblings and extrovert neuroticism personality negatively predicted stress (beta = -0.115, P = 0.037; beta = -0.242, P = 0.001) and considered as protective factors. Introvert neuroticism, Hindu religion, illiterate father, and commerce combination of subjects positively predicted stress among adolescent girls (beta = 0.160, P = 0.026; beta = 0.119, P = 0.028; beta = 0.125, P = 0.017; and beta = 0.278, P < 0.001) and considered as risk factors.\nFindings help in better understanding of educational stress factors among adolescent girls and consider them while developing stress prevention programs.", "A key government priority, artificial intelligence (IA) in healthcare is a real opportunity for nursing professionals. Faced with the daily difficulties encountered, AI could bring a new perspective to nursing care in psychiatry and free up time for professionals which they can then spend with the patient. More training and a multi-disciplinary approach are required.", "Professionalism is the foundation of the doctor-patient relationship with emotional competency at its core. This competency is based on emotional intelligence (EI), contributing to effective work performance. As EI is reasonably new in health professions education in India, this study was conducted to assess the effect of reflection and peer feedback on EI scores among undergraduate medical students and explore facilitating and hindering factors for augmenting EI.\nThis pre- and post interventional study was conducted among 94 final-year (Part I) medical students from a rural medical college in Central India. Baseline assessment of EI scores was done using a self-reported validated EI scale, and then, a mini-workshop was conducted to sensitize students on EI and to train them in writing reflection and giving peer feedback. Between the pretest and posttest, students were asked to write weekly reflection and take monthly feedback from the \"peer\" of their choice. Posttest assessment was done at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Force-field analysis was undertaken with 10 students each with highest and lowest EI scores to assess facilitating and hindering factors.\nThere was a significant improvement (P < 0.0001) in the EI scores at each subsequent time point from baseline. Students who were male, from nuclear families and considered themselves spiritual had significantly higher median EI scores. Students reported self-motivation, social support, and openness to learn new things as enabling forces for augmenting EI. Hindering factors were time constraint and lack of mutual trust in the relationship between students.\nBased on the findings, it can be concluded that personal introspection methods such as self-reflection and peer feedback help to improve the EI of undergraduate students. Therefore, it is imperative that the students are trained in these skills for building their emotional competencies.", "EGD is the most vital procedure for the diagnosis of upper GI lesions. We aimed to compare the performance of unsedated ultrathin transoral endoscopy (U-TOE), unsedated conventional EGD (C-EGD), and sedated C-EGD with or without the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) system.\nIn this prospective, single-blind, 3-parallel-group, randomized, single-center trial, 437 patients scheduled to undergo outpatient EGD were randomized to unsedated U-TOE, unsedated C-EGD, or sedated C-EGD, and each group was then divided into 2 subgroups: with or without the assistance of an AI system to monitor blind spots during EGD. The primary outcome was the blind spot rate of these 3 groups with the assistance of AI. The secondary outcomes were to compare blind spot rates of unsedated U-TOE, unsedated, and sedated C-EGD with or without the assistance of AI, respectively, and the concordance between AI and the endoscopists' review.\nThe blind spot rate with AI-assisted sedated C-EGD was significantly lower than that of unsedated U-TOE and unsedated C-EGD (3.42% vs 21.77% vs 31.23%, respectively; P\u00a0< .05). The blind spot rate of the AI subgroup was lower than that of the control subgroup in all 3 groups (sedated C-EGD: 3.42% vs 22.46%, P\u00a0< .001; unsedated U-TOE: 21.77% vs 29.92%, P\u00a0< .001; unsedated C-EGD: 31.23% vs 42.46%, P\u00a0< .001).\nThe blind spot rate of sedated C-EGD was the lowest among the 3 types of EGD, and the addition of AI had a maximal effect on sedated C-EGD. (Clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR1900020920.).", "Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as deep learning (DL) for computational imaging usually require to experimentally collect a large set of labeled data to train a neural network. Here we demonstrate that a practically usable neural network for computational imaging can be trained by using simulation data. We take computational ghost imaging (CGI) as an example to demonstrate this method. We develop a one-step end-to-end neural network, trained with simulation data, to reconstruct two-dimensional images directly from experimentally acquired one-dimensional bucket signals, without the need of the sequence of illumination patterns. This is in particular useful for image transmission through quasi-static scattering media as little care is needed to take to simulate the scattering process when generating the training data. We believe that the concept of training using simulation data can be used in various DL-based solvers for general computational imaging.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evolving rapidly in healthcare, and various AI applications have been developed to solve some of the most pressing problems that health organizations currently face. It is crucial for health leaders to understand the state of AI technologies and the ways that such technologies can be used to improve the efficiency, safety, and access of health services, achieving value-based care. This article provides a guide to understand the fundamentals of AI technologies (ie, machine learning, natural language processing, and AI voice assistants) as well as their proper use in healthcare. It also provides practical recommendations to help decision-makers develop an AI strategy that can support their digital healthcare transformation.", "In chronic psychosis, reduced trust is associated with a neural insensitivity to social reward and reduced theory of mind (ToM). Here we investigate whether these mechanisms could underlie emerging social impairments in early psychosis. Twenty-two participants with early psychosis and 25 controls (male, 13-19\u00a0years) participated in two interactive trust games against a cooperative and unfair partner. Region of interest neuroimaging analyses included right caudate, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), involved in reward and ToM processing. Both groups showed similar levels of trust (i.e. investments). However, individuals with psychosis failed to activate the caudate differentially in response to cooperation and unfairness while making decisions to trust. During cooperative returns, patients showed reduced and controls increased caudate activation. Patients demonstrated greater rTPJ activation than controls, possibly pointing towards compensatory mechanisms. Effects were associated with Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence vocabulary scores. No group differences emerged in mPFC activation. Early psychosis is associated with an aberrant neural sensitivity to social reward. This could foster reduced social motivation and social isolation. Absent behavioural differences in early, relative to chronic psychosis could indicate that trust is achieved through increased compensatory demand on ToM.", "This study examined the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI) in relation to other WAIS-IV indices, overall test battery mean (OTBM), and impairment (IMP) in an outpatient rehabilitation setting. Participants (N\u2009=\u2009329) were 35% female and 88% Caucasian with average age and education of 42.9 (SD\u2009=\u200913.5) and 13.6 (SD\u2009=\u20092.4) years, respectively. Participants were grouped by diagnosis and validity: traumatic brain injury (TBI; n\u2009=\u2009176; 39% mild), cerebrovascular accident (CVA; n\u2009=\u200952), other neurologic and psychiatric conditions (OTH; n\u2009=\u200949), and questionable performance validity (QPV; n\u2009=\u200952). OTBM was calculated from non-WAIS-IV tests; IMP was dichotomously defined as four or more non-WAIS-IV scores below cutoff (\u226435\u2009T). Significant group differences were observed on CPI, WAIS-IV indices, OTBM, and IMP. CPI significantly contributed (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.51) to a linear regression model predicting OTBM (R2\u2009=\u2009.63) with education and GAI as covariates. A logistic regression model with IMP as the outcome and education, GAI, and CPI as predictors correctly classified 80% of cases with area under the curve of .86. A previously identified cutoff (CPI\u2009<\u200984) correctly classified 65-78% of clinical groups categorized by IMP. A novel cutoff (CPI \u2264 80) differentiated clinical participants with history of mild TBI from the QPV group with sensitivity of 44.2% and specificity of 89.7%. CPI showed incremental validity in predicting OTBM and IMP and warrants further study as a useful clinical addition to other WAIS-IV indices.", "By\u00a0integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to their practice, healthcare professions will evolve towards more efficient patient management and better quality of care. These changes require new competencies to which all professionals must be trained. A methodology to quantify the impact of AI on healthcare occupations can be used to support and anticipate these changes.", "While artificial intelligence (AI) may have raised concerns, these questions are now making way for in-depth discussions on how to take advantage of its potential to ensure advances for patients. From this point of view, AI can constitute a real lever for strengthening the doctor-patient relationship, subject to a certain number of conditions.", "This review aims to provide a comprehensive recapitulation of the evolution in the field of cardiac rhythm monitoring, shedding light in recent progress made in multilead ECG systems and wearable devices, with emphasis on the promising role of the artificial intelligence and computational techniques in the detection of cardiac abnormalities.", "Natural language is ubiquitous in the workflow of medical imaging. Radiologists create and consume free text in their daily work, some of which can be amenable to enhancements through automatic processing. Recent advancements in deep learning and \"artificial intelligence\" have had a significant positive impact on natural language processing (NLP). This article discusses the history of how researchers have extracted data and encoded natural language information for analytical processing, starting from NLP's humble origins in hand-curated, linguistic rules. The evolution of medical NLP including vectorization, word embedding, classification, as well as its use in automated speech recognition, are also explored. Finally, the article will discuss the role of machine learning and neural networks in the context of significant, if incremental, improvements in NLP.", "Artificial intelligence and its applications in healthcare inevitably raise ethical questions.

Whether the current limitations can be overcome is an open question, but critical to answer, given the implications for society.", "The problem of air pollution is a persistent issue for mankind and becoming increasingly serious in recent years, which has drawn worldwide attention. Establishing a scientific and effective air quality early-warning system is really significant and important. Regretfully, previous research didn't thoroughly explore not only air pollutant prediction but also air quality evaluation, and relevant research work is still scarce, especially in China. Therefore, a novel air quality early-warning system composed of prediction and evaluation was developed in this study. Firstly, the advanced data preprocessing technology Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ICEEMDAN) combined with the powerful swarm intelligence algorithm Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the efficient artificial neural network Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) formed the prediction model. Then the predictive results were further analyzed by the method of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, which offered intuitive air quality information and corresponding measures. The proposed system was tested in the Jing-Jin-Ji region of China, a representative research area in the world, and the daily concentration data of six main air pollutants in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang for two years were used to validate the accuracy and efficiency. The results show that the prediction model is superior to other benchmark models in pollutant concentration prediction and the evaluation model is satisfactory in air quality level reporting compared with the actual status. Therefore, the proposed system is believed to play an important role in air pollution control and smart city construction all over the world in the future.", "The biomedical data landscape is fragmented with several isolated, heterogeneous data and knowledge sources, which use varying formats, syntaxes, schemas, and entity notations, existing on the Web. Biomedical researchers face severe logistical and technical challenges to query, integrate, analyze, and visualize data from multiple diverse sources in the context of available biomedical knowledge. Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles may aid toward Web-scale semantic processing and data integration in biomedicine. The biomedical research community has been one of the earliest adopters of these technologies and principles to publish data and knowledge on the Web as linked graphs and ontologies, hence creating the Life Sciences Linked Open Data (LSLOD) cloud. In this paper, we provide our perspective on some opportunities proffered by the use of LSLOD to integrate biomedical data and knowledge in three domains: (1) pharmacology, (2) cancer research, and (3) infectious diseases. We will discuss some of the major challenges that hinder the wide-spread use and consumption of LSLOD by the biomedical research community. Finally, we provide a few technical solutions and insights that can address these challenges. Eventually, LSLOD can enable the development of scalable, intelligent infrastructures that support artificial intelligence methods for augmenting human intelligence to achieve better clinical outcomes for patients, to enhance the quality of biomedical research, and to improve our understanding of living systems.", "Binary skutterudite-type IrP3 possesses a unique structural configuration that exhibits unusual electronic, thermoelectric, and dynamical properties and can be applied in thermoelectric generators; IrP3 has unique square (P4) rings stacked with a relatively loose arrangement and thus has been expected to exhibit fascinating evolution in the bonding patterns and electronic properties under high pressure. Herein, we systematically investigated the global energetically stable structures of IrP3 under ambient- and high-pressure conditions using the swarm intelligence-based structure searching technique in combination with first-principles calculations. Our theoretical prediction shows that the skutterudite-type structure with the Im3[combining macron] symmetry is most stable under ambient conditions. An orthorhombic structure with the Pmma space group was predicted to be energetically superior to the Im3[combining macron] phase above 47.60 GPa. The abrupt volume collapse at the corresponding phase boundaries even reached 14.67%, stemming from the abrupt collapse of large voids in the Im3[combining macron] phase. To explore the possibility of the occurrence of pressure-induced metallization and superconducting states under compressive conditions, the electronic band structures were investigated. Our results showed that the Im3[combining macron] phase was a narrow-gap semiconductor with the band gap of 1.04 eV, whereas the high-pressure Pmma IrP3 was a metallic phase with the superconducting transition temperature of 2.40 K. The current results are beneficial for the further understanding of other skutterudite-type compounds under high pressure.", "The aim of this study was to measure emotional intelligence in nurses in Japan, and to elucidate the characteristics of mental health nurses. Anonymous, self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 206 nurses working in three psychiatric hospitals and two internal medicine hospitals in Japan. The number of participants included in the analysis was 159 (valid response rate, 77.2%), of which 87 were mental health nurses. Emotional intelligence was measured using the Japanese version of the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale. In the analysis, the emotional intelligence of mental health nurses and internal medicine nurses was compared using a t-test. The results of a t-test comparing emotional intelligence scale scores between the mental health nurses and internal medicine nurses showed that the total mean score and Self-Emotions Appraisal score were significantly lower in mental health nurses than in internal medicine nurses. The self-awareness of mental health nurses was significantly lower than that of nurses in other fields (P < 0.001, Cohen's d: 0.65). The results of this study provide a basis for future research on the emotional intelligence of nurses in Japan. Development of an emotional intelligence scale based on the characteristics of Japanese nurses will be important regarding nurses' assessment of their own emotions and the emotions of others. The kinds of people nurses are involved with and the content of their support for others also need to be clarified.", "Adequate tumor detection is critical in complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) to reduce cancer recurrence, but up to 20% of bladder tumors are missed by standard white light cystoscopy. Deep learning augmented cystoscopy may improve tumor localization, intraoperative navigation, and surgical resection of bladder cancer. We aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm for augmented cystoscopic detection of bladder cancer. Patients undergoing cystoscopy/TURBT were recruited and white light videos were recorded. Video frames containing histologically confirmed papillary urothelial carcinoma were selected and manually annotated. We constructed CystoNet, an image analysis platform based on convolutional neural networks, for automated bladder tumor detection using a development dataset of 95 patients for algorithm training and five patients for testing. Diagnostic performance of CystoNet was validated prospectively in an additional 54 patients. In the validation dataset, per-frame sensitivity and specificity were 90.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.3-91.6%) and 98.6% (95% CI, 98.5-98.8%), respectively. Per-tumor sensitivity was 90.9% (95% CI, 90.3-91.6%). CystoNet detected 39 of 41 papillary and three of three flat bladder cancers. With high sensitivity and specificity, CystoNet may improve the diagnostic yield of cystoscopy and efficacy of TURBT. PATIENT SUMMARY: Conventional cystoscopy has recognized shortcomings in bladder cancer detection, with implications for recurrence. Cystoscopy augmented with artificial intelligence may improve cancer detection and resection.", "Learning and memory are two intertwined cognitive functions of the human brain. This paper shows how a family of biologically-inspired self-organizing neural networks, known as fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory (fusion ART), may provide a viable approach to realizing the learning and memory functions. Fusion ART extends the single-channel Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) model to learn multimodal pattern associative mappings. As a natural extension of ART, various forms of fusion ART have been developed for a myriad of learning paradigms, ranging from unsupervised learning to supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, multimodal learning, reinforcement learning, and sequence learning. In addition, fusion ART models may be used for representing various types of memories, notably episodic memory, semantic memory and procedural memory. In accordance with the notion of embodied intelligence, such neural models thus provide a computational account of how an autonomous agent may learn and adapt in a real-world environment. The efficacy of fusion ART in learning and memory shall be discussed through various examples and illustrative case studies.", "Echocardiographic quantification of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) relies on either manual or automated identification of endocardial boundaries followed by model-based calculation of end-systolic and end-diastolic LV volumes. Recent developments in artificial intelligence resulted in computer algorithms that allow near automated detection of endocardial boundaries and measurement of LV volumes and function. However, boundary identification is still prone to errors limiting accuracy in certain patients. We hypothesized that a fully automated machine learning algorithm could circumvent border detection and instead would estimate the degree of ventricular contraction, similar to a human expert trained on tens of thousands of images.\nMachine learning algorithm was developed and trained to automatically estimate LVEF on a database of >50\u2009000 echocardiographic studies, including multiple apical 2- and 4-chamber views (AutoEF, BayLabs). Testing was performed on an independent group of 99 patients, whose automated EF values were compared with reference values obtained by averaging measurements by 3 experts using conventional volume-based technique. Inter-technique agreement was assessed using linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Consistency was assessed by mean absolute deviation among automated estimates from different combinations of apical views. Finally, sensitivity and specificity of detecting of EF \u226435% were calculated. These metrics were compared side-by-side against the same reference standard to those obtained from conventional EF measurements by clinical readers.\nAutomated estimation of LVEF was feasible in all 99 patients. AutoEF values showed high consistency (mean absolute deviation =2.9%) and excellent agreement with the reference values: r=0.95, bias=1.0%, limits of agreement =\u00b111.8%, with sensitivity 0.90 and specificity 0.92 for detection of EF \u226435%. This was similar to clinicians' measurements: r=0.94, bias=1.4%, limits of agreement =\u00b113.4%, sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.87.\nMachine learning algorithm for volume-independent LVEF estimation is highly feasible and similar in accuracy to conventional volume-based measurements, when compared with reference values provided by an expert panel.", "To assess and improve the quality of oral healthcare, we must first agree on what constitutes good care. Currently there is no internationally accepted definition for quality of oral healthcare. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to establish a working definition for quality of oral healthcare that would help to advance further improvements in the field of quality improvement in oral healthcare. The development of the working definition included a 3-step approach: 1) literature screening; 2) expert-based compilation of an initial list of topics, leaning on the National Academy of Medicine framework for quality of care; and 3) a World Caf\u00e9 with voting, which took place during the annual general meeting of the International Association for Dental Research in 2018. Following this approach, the collective intelligence of involved participants yielded a comprehensive list of items, prioritized by relevance. The resulting working definition comprises 7 domains\u2014patient safety, effectiveness, efficiency, patient-centeredness, equitability, timeliness, access to care\u2014and 30 items, which together characterize quality of oral healthcare. This aspirational working definition provides the potential to facilitate further conversations and activities aiming at quality improvement in oral healthcare.\nThis special communication describes the development of a working definition for quality of oral healthcare. The findings of this study are intended to raise awareness of the relevance of quality improvement initiatives in oral healthcare. The working definition described here has the potential to facilitate further conversations and activities aiming at quality improvement in oral healthcare.", "The digital transformation of society has a tremendous impact on both medicine and healthcare. The generation and processing of continuously growing amounts of digital data can be used to facilitate new approaches in research, particularly for healthcare research of common diseases such as urolithiasis.\nPresentation of the design of the German medical informatics initiative (MI-I) and the resulting possibilities for healthcare research in the field of urolithiasis.\nFor a meaningful utilization patient data must be readily available for research purposes and suitable methods for the analysis, interpretation and utilization must be developed. The aim of the German MI\u2011I is to make patient data collected during hospitalization available for research. The formation of so-called data integration centers will create a\u00a0digital network that will facilitate the utilization and exchange of data between institutions. Advanced artificial intelligence algorithms will be used for analysis of the immense amounts of data. In May 2019 the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research boosted funding for the set-up of a\u00a0digital nationwide registry on urolithiasis where the data foundation is to be generated based on the digital infrastructure of the MI\u2011I. The registry is intended to answer questions from the three relevant areas: \"impact of the disease on individuals and society\" (e.g. limitations in the quality of life and ability to work, treatment costs), \"identification of further risk factors\" (e.g. personalized medicine, especially taking account of lifestyle and nutrition, development of a\u00a0risk score) and \"evaluation of various treatment approaches\" (which is the best treatment for an individual patient?).", "As artificial intelligence methods for the diagnosis of disease advance, we aimed to evaluate machine learning in the predictive task of distinguishing between malignant and benign breast lesions on an independent clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset within a single institution for subsequent use as a computer aid for radiologists.\nComputer analysis was conducted on consecutive dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) studies from 1483 breast cancer and 496 benign patients who underwent MRI examinations between February 2015 and October 2017; with the age ranges of the cancer and benign patients being 19 to 77 and 16 to 76\u2009years old, respectively. Cases were separated into a training dataset (years 2015 & 2016; 1444 cases) and an independent testing dataset (year 2017; 535 cases) based solely on MRI examination date. After radiologist indication of the lesion, the computer automatically segmented and extracted radiomic features, which were subsequently merged with a support-vector machine (SVM) to yield a lesion signature. Area under the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) served as the primary figure of merit in the statistical evaluation for this clinical classification task.\nIn the task of distinguishing malignant and benign breast lesions DCE-MRI, the trained predictive model yielded an AUC value of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.858, 0.922) on the independent image set. AUC values of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.845, 0.926) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.837, 0.940) were obtained for mass lesions only and non-mass lesions only, respectively. Compared with actual clinical management decisions, the predictive model achieved 99.5% sensitivity with 9.6% fewer recommended biopsies.\nOn an independent, consecutive clinical dataset within a single institution, a trained machine learning system yielded promising performance in distinguishing between malignant and benign breast lesions.", "This article reflects on the changing nature of health information access and the transition of focus from electronic health records (EHRs) to personal health records (PHRs) along with the challenges and need for alignment of national initiatives for EHR and PHR in the National Health Service (NHS) of the UK. The importance of implementing integrated EHRs as a route to enhance the quality of health delivery has been increasingly understood. EHRs, however, carry several limitations that include major fragmentation through multiple providers and protocols throughout the NHS. Questions over ownership and control of data further complicate the potential for fully utilising records. Analysing the previous initiatives and the current landscape, we identify that adopting a patient health record system can empower patients and allow better harmonisation of clinical data at a national level. We propose regional PHR 'hubs' to provide a universal interface that integrates digital health data at a regional level with further integration at a national level. We propose that these PHR hubs will reduce the complexity of connections, decrease governance challenges and interoperability issues while also providing a safe platform for high-quality scalable and sustainable digital solutions, including artificial intelligence across the UK NHS, serving as an exemplar for other countries which wish to realise the full value of healthcare records.", "Knowing that your parent or caregiver will be there for you in times of emotional need and distress is a core aspect of the human experience of feeling loved and being securely attached. In contrast, an insecure attachment pattern is found in many antisocial youth and is related to less sensitive caregiving. Such youth are often distrustful of adults and authority figures, and are at high risk of poor outcomes. As they become adults, they require extensive health, social and economic support, costing society ten times more than their well-adjusted peers. However, it is not known whether insecure attachment itself is associated with higher costs in at-risk youth, independently of potential confounders, nor whether cost differences are already beginning to emerge early in adolescence.\nSample: A total of 174 young people followed up aged 9-17\u00a0years (mean 12.1, SD 1.8): 85 recruited with moderate antisocial behaviour (80th percentile) from a school screen aged 4-6\u00a0years; 89 clinically referred with very high antisocial behaviour (98th percentile) aged 3-7 years.\nCosts by detailed health economic and service-use interview; attachment security to mother and father from interview; diagnostic interviews for oppositional and conduct problems; self-reported delinquent behaviour.\nCosts were greater for youth insecurely attached to their mothers (secure \u00a36,743, insecure \u00a310,199, p\u00a0=\u00a0.001) and more so to fathers (secure \u00a31,353, insecure \u00a313,978, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). These differences remained significant (mother p\u00a0=\u00a0.019, father p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) after adjusting for confounders, notably family income and education, intelligence and antisocial behaviour severity.\nAttachment insecurity is a significant predictor of public cost in at-risk youth, even after accounting for covariates. Since adolescent attachment security is influenced by caregiving quality earlier in childhood, these findings add support to the public health case for early parenting interventions to improve child outcomes and reduce the financial burden on society.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning, convolutional neural networks and big data has been increasingly effective in the diagnosis and treatment of multiple primary pulmonary nodules. In comparison to previous imaging systems, AI measures more objective parameters such as three-dimensional (3D) volume, probability of malignant nodules, and possible pathological patterns, making the access to the properties of nodules more objective. In our retrospective study, a total of 53 patients with synchronous and metachronous multiple pulmonary nodules were enrolled of which 33 patients were confirmed by pathological tests to have primary binodules, and nine to have primary trinodules. A total of 15 patients had only one focus removed. The statistical results showed that the agreement in the AI diagnosis and postoperative pathological tests was 88.8% in identifying benign or malignant lesions. In addition, the probability of malignancy of benign lesions, preinvasive lesions (AAH, AIS) and invasive lesions (MIA, IA) was totally different (49.40\u00b138.41% vs 80.22\u00b113.55% vs 88.17\u00b117.31%). The purpose of our study was to provide references for the future application of AI in the diagnosis and follow-up of multiple pulmonary nodules. AI may represent a relevant diagnostic aid that shows more accurate and objective results in the diagnosis of multiple pulmonary nodules, reducing the time required for interpretation of results by directly displaying visual information to doctors and patients and together with the clinical conditions of MPLC patients, offering plans for follow-up and treatment that may be more beneficial and reasonable for patients. Despite the great application potential in pneumosurgery, further research is needed to verify the accuracy and range of the application of AI.", "Estimating premorbid general cognitive functioning is an essential component to the neuropsychological evaluation process. The North American Adult Reading Test (NAART) is a method to predict premorbid general cognitive functioning based on word reading skills developed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), which is currently in its fourth edition (WAIS-IV). The Test of Premorbid Function (TOPF) was developed using the WAIS-IV, based on the same method as the NAART, to estimate premorbid intellectual ability. There is a paucity of research comparing estimates of premorbid general intellectual ability between the NAART and TOPF. This study evaluated the clinical utility of premorbid estimates of FSIQ derived from the NAART and TOPF in a sample of 101 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Differences between NAART-derived premorbid FSIQs and TOPF simple demographic predicted FSIQs were significant (p\u2009<\u2009.001) with large effect sizes. NAART estimated premorbid FSIQ (M\u2009=\u2009104.04, SD\u2009=\u20098.42) was significantly greater than TOPF premorbid estimates (M\u2009=\u200999.83, SD\u2009=\u20099.26). Results suggested NAART-derived estimates of premorbid FSIQ may be more accurate than TOPF-based estimates, which likely underestimated premorbid FSIQ in this sample of patients with epilepsy. Limitations and future directions are discussed.", "Emotional intelligence is a social skill that controls stress and affects one's ability to cope with the demands and environmental pressures; it so can improve professional competence in health care providers such as nursing students. Training on emotional intelligence increases the mental health and influences the mutual relationships, stress, depression and aggression. This study aimed to determine the effect of emotional intelligence skills training program on the stress and academic success of nursing students in a higher education health complex.\nThis study is a quasi-experimental study with an educational intervention. The participants included 100 students of nursing selected by stratified random sampling from both genders. They were randomly categorized into two intervention and control groups including 50 subjects, respectively. We used Meyer and Salvia model in Emotional Intelligence training in the intervention group. During the training sessions in the intervention group, the control group did not receive any intervention. Academic stress and professional competence in both groups were measured before and two weeks after the experiment. SPSS version 21 was used to analyze the data, using Paired t-test, independent t-test, Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney and Chi-Square tests.\nThe mean age of the participants was 20\u2009\u00b1\u20092.14 years old. According to the results, the mean difference of the changes in the professional competence (P<0.001), total academic stress (P<0.001), and the four areas of academic stress such as emotional response (P<0.001), physical response (P<0.001) and physiological response (p<0.001) were significant. The intervention group, as compared with the control group, showed no significant effect on the other factors of academic stress such as frustration, conflict, academic pressure, changes and self-imposed stress.\nThe education of emotional intelligence components can improve the efficiency of nursing care services and professional competence due to deceased stress.", "Introduction: At present, cancer imaging examination relies mainly on manual reading of doctors, which requests a high standard of doctors' professional skills, clinical experience, and concentration. However, the increasing amount of medical imaging data has brought more and more challenges to radiologists. The detection of digestive system cancer (DSC) based on artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a solution for automatic analysis of medical images and assist doctors to achieve high-precision intelligent diagnosis of cancers. Areas covered: The main goal of this paper is to introduce the main research methods of the AI based detection of DSC, and provide relevant reference for researchers. Meantime, it summarizes the main problems existing in these methods, and provides better guidance for future research. Expert commentary: The automatic classification, recognition, and segmentation of DSC can be better realized through the methods of machine learning and deep learning, which minimize the internal information of images that are difficult for humans to discover. In the diagnosis of DSC, the use of AI to assist imaging surgeons can achieve cancer detection rapidly and effectively and save doctors' diagnosis time. These can lay the foundation for better clinical diagnosis, treatment planning and accurate quantitative evaluation of DSC.", "Automatic segmentation of retinal images is an important task in computer-assisted medical image analysis for the diagnosis of diseases such as hypertension, diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy, and arteriosclerosis. Among the diseases, diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of vision detachment, can be diagnosed early through the detection of retinal vessels. The manual detection of these retinal vessels is a time-consuming process that can be automated with the help of artificial intelligence with deep learning. The detection of vessels is difficult due to intensity variation and noise from non-ideal imaging. Although there are deep learning approaches for vessel segmentation, these methods require many trainable parameters, which increase the network complexity. To address these issues, this paper presents a dual-residual-stream-based vessel segmentation network (Vess-Net), which is not as deep as conventional semantic segmentation networks, but provides good segmentation with few trainable parameters and layers. The method takes advantage of artificial intelligence for semantic segmentation to aid the diagnosis of retinopathy. To evaluate the proposed Vess-Net method, experiments were conducted with three publicly available datasets for vessel segmentation: digital retinal images for vessel extraction (DRIVE), the Child Heart Health Study in England (CHASE-DB1), and structured analysis of retina (STARE). Experimental results show that Vess-Net achieved superior performance for all datasets with sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy (Acc) of 80.22%, 98.1%, 98.2%, and 96.55% for DRVIE; 82.06%, 98.41%, 98.0%, and 97.26% for CHASE-DB1; and 85.26%, 97.91%, 98.83%, and 96.97% for STARE dataset.", "Since the advent of recombinant DNA technology, expectations (and trepidations) about the potential for altering genes and controlling our biology at the fundamental level have been sky high. These expectations have gone largely unfulfilled. But though the dream (or nightmare) of being able to control our biology is still far off, gene editing research has made enormous strides toward potential clinical use. This paper argues that when it comes to determining permissible uses of gene editing in one important medical context-germline intervention in reproductive medicine-issues about enhancement and eugenics are, for the foreseeable future, a red herring. Current translational goals for gene editing research involve a different kind of editing than would be required to achieve manipulation of complex traits such as intelligence, and there are more pressing (and unresolved) questions that need attention if clinical use of gene editing in reproductive medicine ever becomes a possibility.", "Very preterm birth is associated with attention deficits that interfere with academic performance. A better understanding of attention processes is necessary to support very preterm born children. This study examined voluntary and involuntary attentional control in very preterm born adolescents by measuring saccadic eye movements. Additionally, these control processes were related to symptoms of inattention, intelligence, and academic performance. Participants included 47 very preterm and 61 full-term born 13-years-old adolescents. Oculomotor control was assessed using the antisaccade and oculomotor capture paradigm. Very preterm born adolescents showed deficits in antisaccade but not in oculomotor capture performance, indicating impairments in voluntary but not involuntary attentional control. These impairments mediated the relation between very preterm birth and inattention, intelligence, and academic performance.", "Previous studies have identified an inverse association between melanoma and smoking; however, data from population-based studies are scarce.\nTo determine the association between smoking and socioeconomic (SES) on the risk of development of melanoma. Furthermore, we sought to determine the implications of smoking and SES on survival.\nWe conducted a population-based case-control study. Cases were identified from the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit (WCISU) during 2000-2015 and controls from the general population. Smoking and SES were obtained from data linkage with other national databases. The association of smoking status and SES on the incidence of melanoma were assessed using binary logistic regression. Multivariate survival analysis was performed on a melanoma cohort using a Cox proportional hazard model using survival as the outcome.\nDuring 2000-2015, 9636 patients developed melanoma. Smoking data were obtained for 7124 (73\u00b79%) of these patients. There were 26\u00a0408 controls identified from the general population. Smoking was inversely associated with melanoma incidence [odds ratio (OR) 0\u00b770,\u00a095% confidence interval (CI) 0\u00b765-0\u00b776]. Smoking was associated with an increased overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1\u00b730, 95% CI 1\u00b709-1\u00b755], but not associated with melanoma-specific mortality. Patients with higher SES had an increased association with melanoma incidence (OR 1\u00b758,\u00a095% CI 1\u00b744-1\u00b773). Higher SES was associated with an increased chance of both overall (HR 0\u00b767, 95% CI 0\u00b756-0\u00b781) and disease-specific survival (HR 0\u00b769, 95% CI 0\u00b753-0\u00b790).\nOur study has demonstrated that smoking appeared to be associated with reduced incidence of melanoma. Although smoking increases overall mortality, no association was observed with melanoma-specific mortality. Further work is required to determine if there is a biological mechanism underlying this relationship or an alternative explanation, such as survival bias. What's already known about this topic? Previous studies have been contradictory with both negative and positive associations between smoking and the incidence of melanoma reported. Previous studies have either been limited by publication bias because of selective reporting or underpowered. What does this study add? Our large study identified an inverse association between smoking status and melanoma incidence. Although smoking status was negatively associated with overall disease survival, no significant association was noted in melanoma-specific survival. Socioeconomic status remains closely associated with melanoma. Although higher socioeconomic populations are more likely to develop the disease, patients with lower socioeconomic status continue to have a worse prognosis.", "Humans are able to master a variety of knowledge and skills with ongoing learning. By contrast, dramatic performance degradation is observed when new tasks are added to an existing neural network model. This phenomenon, termed catastrophic forgetting, is one of the major roadblocks that prevent deep neural networks from achieving human-level artificial intelligence. Several research efforts (e.g., lifelong or continual learning algorithms) have proposed to tackle this problem. However, they either suffer from an accumulating drop in performance as the task sequence grows longer, or require storing an excessive number of model parameters for historical memory, or cannot obtain competitive performance on the new tasks. In this letter, we focus on the incremental multitask image classification scenario. Inspired by the learning process of students, who usually decompose complex tasks into easier goals, we propose an adversarial feature alignment method to avoid catastrophic forgetting. In our design, both the low-level visual features and high-level semantic features serve as soft targets and guide the training process in multiple stages, which provide sufficient supervised information of the old tasks and help to reduce forgetting. Due to the knowledge distillation and regularization phenomena, the proposed method gains even better performance than fine-tuning on the new tasks, which makes it stand out from other methods. Extensive experiments in several typical lifelong learning scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy on new tasks and performance preservation on old tasks.", "Nutrition during the first 3\u2009years of life is critical to neurodevelopment. Native populations experience poverty, inequality, and food insecurity. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between feeding during infancy and cognitive performance in schoolchildren of rural indigenous communities in Riobamba, Ecuador.\nThirty-seven schoolchildren (5-6\u2009years) were recruited. We determined duration of exclusive breastfeeding, weaning age, age of cow's milk incorporation, daily intake of cow's milk, age of solid and liquid incorporation, and sociocultural and anthropometric parameters. Verbal, manipulative, and total intelligence quotients were evaluated with Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence.\nMeans of verbal, manipulative, and total intelligence quotient scores were 86.46\u2009\u00b1\u200911.55, 96.39\u2009\u00b1\u20099.96, and 89.25\u2009\u00b1\u200910.43, respectively. Children were exclusively breastfed until 6.83\u2009\u00b1\u20093.97\u2009months and weaned at 17.17\u2009\u00b1 5.58\u2009months. Age of cow's milk incorporation was 12.58\u2009\u00b1\u20096.06\u2009months, with a daily intake of 737.50\u2009\u00b1\u2009417.50\u2009mL. Solids were incorporated at 10.11\u2009\u00b1 4.43\u2009months and liquids at 7.72\u2009\u00b1\u20093.30\u2009months. Positive associations between duration of exclusive breastfeeding and manipulative (unadjusted: \u03c1 = .545, P = .006; r = .491, P = .028; adjusted for children's body mass index, and ethnicity and educational level of mothers: r = .522, P = .041) and total (unadjusted: \u03c1 = .483, P = .017; adjusted: r = .572, P = .036) intelligence quotients were found. Frequency of children with manipulative (\u03c72 [2] = 7.093, P = .029) and total (\u03c72 [2] = 7.198, P = .027) intelligence quotient \u226590 was higher in those exclusively breastfed >6\u2009months. Furthermore, schoolchildren in the >6\u2009months group had better manipulative (101.75\u2009\u00b1\u20099.08 vs 89.71\u2009\u00b1\u20098.56, P = .038) and total (94.50\u2009\u00b1 11.89 vs 84.86\u2009\u00b1\u20095.05, P = .036) intelligence quotient than those in the <6\u2009months group, independent of anthropometric and sociocultural factors.\nLonger exclusive breastfeeding was related to better total intelligence quotient in rural indigenous schoolchildren.", "Prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is associated with developmental compromises in verbal intelligence and social skills in childhood. Our aim was to evaluate whether a multifeature Mismatch Negativity (MMN) paradigm assessing semantic and emotional components of linguistic and emotional processing would be useful to detect possible alterations in early auditory processing of newborns with prenatal AED exposure.\nData on AED exposure, pregnancy outcome, neuropsychological evaluation of the mothers, information on maternal epilepsy type, and a structured neurological examination of the newborn were collected prospectively. Blinded to AED exposure, we compared a cohort of 36 AED-exposed with 46 control newborns at the age of two weeks by measuring MMN with a multifeature paradigm with six linguistically relevant deviant sounds and three emotionally uttered sounds.\nFrontal responses for the emotionally uttered stimulus Happy differed significantly in the exposed newborns compared with the control newborns. In addition, responses to sounds with or without emotional component differed in newborns exposed to multiple AEDs compared with control newborns or to newborns exposed to only one AED.\nThese preliminary findings suggest that prenatal AED exposure may alter early processing of emotionally and linguistically relevant sound information.", "We tested whether the reliability and validity of psychological testing underlying an expert's opinion influenced judgments made by judges, attorneys, and mock jurors.\nWe predicted that the participants would judge the expert's evidence more positively when it had high validity and high reliability.\nIn Experiment 1, judges (N = 111) and attorneys (N = 95) read a summary of case facts and proffer of expert testimony on the intelligence of a litigant. The psychological testing varied in scientific quality; either there was (a) blind administration (i.e., the psychologist did not have an expectation for the test result) of a highly reliable test, (b) nonblind administration (i.e., the psychologist did have an expectation for the test result) of a highly reliable test, or (c) blind administration of a test with low reliability. In a trial simulation (Experiment 2), we varied the scientific quality of the intelligence test and whether the cross-examination addressed the scientific quality of the test.\nThe variations in scientific quality did not influence judges' admissibility decisions nor their ratings of scientific quality nor did it influence attorneys' decisions about whether to move to exclude the evidence. Attorneys' ratings of scientific quality were sensitive to variations in reliability but not the testing conditions. Scientifically informed cross-examinations did not help mock jurors (N = 192) evaluate the validity or the reliability of a psychological test.\nCross-examination was an ineffective method for educating jurors about problems associated with nonblind testing and reliability, which highlights the importance of training judges to evaluate the quality of expert evidence.

Nine experts from the disciplines involved in breast disease management\u00a0-\u00a0including physicists and radiologists\u00a0-\u00a0convened a meeting on June 3, 2019 to discuss the evidence for the use of this technology in plenary and focused sessions. Prior to the meeting, the group performed a literature review on predefined topics. This paper presents the consensus reached by this working group on recommendations for the future use of AI in breast screening and related research topics.", "This paper presents a study based on data analysis of the sarcopenia level in older adults. Sarcopenia is a prevalent pathology in adults of around 50 years of age, whereby the muscle mass decreases by 1 to 2% a year, and muscle strength experiences an annual decrease of 1.5% between 50 and 60 years of age, subsequently increasing by 3% each year. The World Health Organisation estimates that 5-13% of individuals of between 60 and 70 years of age and 11-50% of persons of 80 years of age or over have sarcopenia. This study was conducted with 166 patients and 99 variables. Demographic data was compiled including age, gender, place of residence, schooling, marital status, level of education, income, profession, and financial support from the State of Baja California, and biochemical parameters such as glycemia, cholesterolemia, and triglyceridemia were determined. A total of 166 patients took part in the study, with an average age of 77.24 years. The purpose of the study was to provide an automatic classifier of sarcopenia level in older adults using artificial intelligence in addition to identifying the weight of each variable used in the study. We used machine learning techniques in this work, in which 10 classifiers were employed to assess the variables and determine which would provide the best results, namely, Nearest Neighbors (3), Linear SVM (Support Vector Machines) (C = 0.025), RBF (Radial Basis Function) SVM (gamma = 2, C = 1), Gaussian Process (RBF (1.0)), Decision Tree (max_depth = 3), Random Forest (max_depth=3, n_estimators = 10), MPL (Multilayer Perceptron) (alpha = 1), AdaBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis). Feature selection determined by the mean for the variable ranking suggests that Age, Systolic Arterial Hypertension (HAS), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Number of chronic diseases (ECNumber), and Sodium are the five most important variables in determining the sarcopenia level, and are thus of great importance prior to establishing any treatment or preventive measure. Analysis of the relationships existing between the presence of the variables and classifiers used in moderate and severe sarcopenia revealed that the sarcopenia level using the RBF SVM classifier with Age, HAS, MNA, ECNumber, and Sodium variables has 82'5 accuracy, a 90'2 F1, and 82'8 precision.", "A reformed approach to health care tackles health at its roots. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in those exposed to them may contribute significantly to the root causes of many diseases of lifestyle. ACEs are traumatic experiences, such as physical and emotional abuse and exposure to risky family environments. In 1998, a ground-breaking study found that nearly 70% of Americans experience at least 1 ACE in their lifetime, and graded exposure is associated with the presence of mental health disorders, heart disease, cancer, and other chronic diseases. Over the past 20 years, evidence has demonstrated further disease risk, outcomes, and epigenetic underpinnings in children and adults with ACEs. Building resilience-the capacity to adapt in healthy ways to traumatic experiences-through lifestyle modification offers potential to combat the negative health effects associated with ACEs. Emerging research demonstrates resilience is cultivated through individual skills (emotional intelligence, coping, and fostering healthy lifestyle choices), and nurturing supportive relationships. Being mindful of the impact and prevalence of ACEs and diversity of individuals' experiences in society will help build resilience and combat the root cause of chronic disease. This review aims to cultivate that awareness and will discuss 3 objectives: to discuss the effects and hypothesized pathophysiological underpinnings of traumatic experiences in childhood on health and wellbeing throughout life, to present ways we can promote resilience in our daily lives and patient encounters, and to demonstrate how advocacy for the reduction of ACEs and promotion of resilient, trauma-informed environments are fundamental to health care reform.", "Over the last few years the field of radiomics has been gaining ground in the field of nuclear medicine and in multimodality imaging. Within this context, numerous studies have exploited the potential interest of radiomics in clinical practice, within the diagnostic field as well as in prognostic and predictive modeling of patient response. Although these studies have showed some interesting results, there are also persistent conflicting conclusions. Most of these studies suffer from consistently low number of patients, lack of external dataset-based validation of most frequently single center determined models and non-standardized calculation of radiomics features. In the future, clear identification of the most pertinent applications of clinical utilization in combination with multi-center studies will allow more concrete clinical applications of radiomics to be identified. In addition, the recent interest of artificial intelligence which can completely change the current paradigm of radiomics use in clinical practice needs to be integrated within this framework. This paper highlights the main areas of radiomics applications considered up to date and provides an insight on the main issues and potential solutions in order to allow a potential future integration in clinical practice.", "A great diversity of factors contribute to the pathogenesis of autism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Early detection is known to correlate with improved long term outcomes. There is therefore intense scientific interest in the pathogenesis of and early prediction of autism. Recent reports suggest that epigenetic alterations may play a vital role in disease pathophysiology. We conducted an epigenome-wide analysis of newborn leucocyte (blood spot) DNA in autism as defined at the time of sample collection. Our goal was to investigate the epigenetic basis of autism and identification of early biomarkers for disease prediction. Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay was performed to measure DNA methylation level in 14 autism cases and 10 controls. The accuracy of cytosine methylation for autism detection using six different Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches including Deep-Learning (DL) was determined. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was further used to interrogate autism pathogenesis by identifying over-represented biological pathways. We found highly significant dysregulation of CpG methylation in 230 loci (249 genes). DL yielded an AUC (95% CI)\u202f=\u202f1.00 (0.80-1.00) with 97.5% sensitivity and 100.0% specificity for autism detection. Epigenetic dysregulation was identified in several important candidate genes including some previously linked to autism development e.g.: EIF4E, FYN, SHANK1, VIM, LMX1B, GABRB1, SDHAP3 and PACS2. We observed significant enrichment of molecular pathways involved in neuroinflammation signaling, synaptic long term potentiation, serotonin degradation, mTOR signaling and signaling by Rho-Family GTPases. Our findings suggest significant epigenetic role in autism development and epigenetic markers appeared highly accurate for newborn prediction.", "In recent studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperformed dermatologists in distinguishing dermoscopic images of melanoma and nevi. In these studies, dermatologists and artificial intelligence were considered as opponents. However, the combination of classifiers frequently yields superior results, both in machine learning and among humans. In this study, we investigated the potential benefit of combining human and artificial intelligence for skin cancer classification.\nUsing 11,444 dermoscopic images, which were divided into five diagnostic categories, novel deep learning techniques were used to train a single CNN. Then, both 112 dermatologists of 13 German university hospitals and the trained CNN independently classified a set of 300 biopsy-verified skin lesions into those five classes. Taking into account the certainty of the decisions, the two independently determined diagnoses were combined to a new classifier with the help of a gradient boosting method. The primary end-point of the study was the correct classification of the images into five designated categories, whereas the secondary end-point was the correct classification of lesions as either benign or malignant (binary classification).\nRegarding the multiclass task, the combination of man and machine achieved an accuracy of 82.95%. This was 1.36% higher than the best of the two individual classifiers (81.59% achieved by the CNN). Owing to the class imbalance in the binary problem, sensitivity, but not accuracy, was examined and demonstrated to be superior (89%) to the best individual classifier (CNN with 86.1%). The specificity in the combined classifier decreased from 89.2% to 84%. However, at an equal sensitivity of 89%, the CNN achieved a specificity of only 81.5% INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that the combination of human and artificial intelligence achieves superior results over the independent results of both of these systems.", "Due to the massive data sets available for drug candidates, modern drug discovery has advanced to the big data era. Central to this shift is the development of artificial intelligence approaches to implementing innovative modeling based on the dynamic, heterogeneous, and large nature of drug data sets. As a result, recently developed artificial intelligence approaches such as deep learning and relevant modeling studies provide new solutions to efficacy and safety evaluations of drug candidates based on big data modeling and analysis. The resulting models provided deep insights into the continuum from chemical structure to in vitro, in vivo, and clinical outcomes. The relevant novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recent modeling studies. In summary, the new advancement of artificial intelligence in the big data era has paved the road to future rational drug development and optimization, which will have a significant impact on drug discovery procedures and, eventually, public health.", "About one-fifth of patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). This study examined clinical and temperament profile of female adolescents with both disorders (AN+NSSI) as compared with peers with AN only.\nA consecutive sample of 73 female adolescents with AN (mean age: 13.77\u202fyears), who had been admitted to inpatient or day-hospital services, received clinical, cognitive, and temperament/character evaluations. Of them, 32 met DSM-5 criteria also for NSSI. Assessments included demographics, standard nutrition parameters, Youth Self-Report (YSR), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children IV (WISC-IV), Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).\nNo differences were detected between AN+NSSI and AN in demographics, body mass index, or age at onset of AN. AN+NSSI had higher rate of binging and purging, higher YSR scores for both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, lower total IQ, and lower Self-directedness and Cooperativeness scores.\nThese data suggest that adolescents with AN+NSSI have psychopathological, cognitive and overall character features that differ from patients with AN only. These characteristics may have implications for treatment and outcome.", "Despite the great media attention for artificial intelligence (AI), for many health care professionals the term and the functioning of AI remain a \"black box,\" leading to exaggerated expectations on the one hand and unfounded fears on the other. In this review, we provide a conceptual classification and a brief summary of the technical fundamentals of AI. Possible applications are discussed on the basis of a typical work flow in medical imaging, grouped by planning, scanning, interpretation, and reporting. The main limitations of current AI techniques, such as issues with interpretability or the need for large amounts of annotated data, are briefly addressed. Finally, we highlight the possible impact of AI on the nuclear medicine profession, the associated challenges and, last but not least, the opportunities.", "The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is widely used to evaluate cognitive decline in older individuals. Although, age and education-related norms have been published, the vast majority of diagnostic clinicians use the MoCA cutoff score to identify patients with cognitive impairment.\nTo identify whether the MoCA cutoff is too stringent for cognitively normal older adults.\nTwenty-seven participants aged 68 to 83 (mean = 75.07, standard deviation [SD] = 4.62), with high education level (mean = 17.14 years, SD = 3.21) underwent cognitive assessment once a year for 5 consecutive years. The cognitive assessment included MoCA; Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure test; Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Information and Digit Span Subtest; Trail Making Test; Verbal Fluency Test; and Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze all standardized scores as well as MoCA standardized and raw scores across all years.\nRepeated-measures ANOVA for MoCA raw scores yielded significant decline across the years (P < .05). From the second year and forward, the average MoCA total score was below the cutoff of 26/30. However, in substantial contrast, all other neuropsychological scores and the MoCA standardized scores were within the normal range and even above in all years.\nOur study demonstrates that the currently used MoCA cutoff is too high even for highly educated, cognitively normal older adults. Therefore, it is crucial to use the age- and education-related norms for the MoCA in order to avoid misdiagnosis of cognitive decline.", "Patients undergoing epilepsy surgery are on polytherapy. Drug tapering is usually done after 1 year in adults and after 6 months in children. Sometimes, drugs have to be altered during the perioperative period, which is more commonly seen in hemispherotomy (HS) patients. The present study was done to compare perioperative drug alterations between HS and temporal (TL) lobectomy patients.\nProspective analysis of postoperative HS and TL patients was done. Primary outcomes were drug number, dosage changes, and seizure outcome. Secondary outcome studied was a change in intelligence quotient (IQ) in the two groups.\nAt total of 71 patients were included. Perioperative drug stopping (clobazam - CLB) was needed in 3/38 patients in the HS group, due to sedation. Dosage was reduced in 23/38 (60.52%) in HS group, and in 2/33 (6%) in TL group P < 0.001. The most common drug was CLB, with reduction in 21/27 (77.77%) patients, with a mean reduction of 41.21 \u00b1 4.01%. Two patients required drug substitution in the HS group. About 64/71 (90.1%) patients achieved Class I outcome at a 1-year postoperative time point (TL - 90.9%, HS - 89.47%). There was no change in IQ in any of the groups.\nPerioperative drug alteration is often needed in the HS patients as compared to TL patients. Benzodiazepines have to be reduced to maintain alertness in the HS patients. The increased sedation postoperatively can be due to decreased cortical drive over the reticular activating system, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor denervation hypersensitivity, or increased activity of drugs over the remaining active hemisphere.", "This study was conducted to test a path model for the factors related to undergraduate nursing students' clinical practicum stress, based on Lazarus and Folkman's stress-coping model.\nThis study utilized a path analysis design. A total of 235 undergraduate nursing students participated in this study. The variables in the hypothetical path model consisted of clinical practicum, emotional intelligence, self-efficacy, Nun-chi, and nursing professionalism. We tested the fit of the hypothetical path model using SPSS/WIN 23.0 and AMOS 22.0.\nThe final model fit demonstrated a satisfactory statistical acceptance level: goodness-of-fit-index=.98, adjusted goodness-of-fit-index=.91, comparative fit index=.98, normed fit index=.95, Tucker-Lewis index=.92, and root mean square error of approximation=.06. Self-efficacy (\u03b2=-.22, p=.003) and Nun-chi behavior (\u03b2=-.17, p=.024) were reported as significant factors affecting clinical practicum stress, explaining 10.2% of the variance. Nursing professionalism (\u03b2=.20, p=.006) and self-efficacy (\u03b2=.45, p<.001) had direct effects on emotional intelligence, explaining 45.9% of the variance. Self-efficacy had indirect effects on Nun-chi understanding (\u03b2=.20, p<.001) and Nun-chi behavior (\u03b2=.09, p=.005) through emotional intelligence. Nursing professionalism had indirect effects on Nun-chi understanding (\u03b2=.09, p=.005) and Nun-chi behavior (\u03b2=.09, p=.005) through emotional intelligence. The variables for self-efficacy and nursing professionalism explained 29.1% of the Nun-chi understanding and 18.2% of the Nun-chi behavior, respectively.\nIn undergraduate nursing education, it is important to identify and manage factors that affect clinical practicum stress. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of Nun-chi, self-efficacy, emotional intelligence, and nursing professionalism in the development of an educational strategy for undergraduate nursing students.", "The association between hypothyroxinemia of prematurity with neurodevelopment was controversial.\nTo compare 5 year neurodevelopmental outcomes of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with hypothyroxinemia of prematurity against those without.\nRetrospective cohort study in a single tertiary neonatal centre of VLBW infants born between the year 2008 to 2011. Comparisons were made between all abnormal and normal thyroid function controls using cord thyroid function tests, thyroid function tests during admission and pre-discharge thyroid function test done at term equivalent age. At 2 years corrected age, Bayley scales of infant and toddler development-third edition and Vineland II adaptive behaviour scales (VABS) were collected. At 5 years, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III), Bracken School Readiness Assessment, VABS and Beery Test of Visual-Motor Integration were collected.\n110 subjects were studied at 2 years corrected age and 80 subjects at 5 years old. 29 infants had abnormal thyroid function test (10 infants with hypothyroxinemia of prematurity and 19 infants with transient thyroid abnormalities). There were no significant difference in the 2 years and 5 years developmental outcome between infants with and without hypothyroxinemia of prematurity (p-value>0.05); and between infants with and without transient thyroid abnormalities (p-value>0.05). There were no significant difference in neurological, visual and hearing impairment between infants with or without hypothyroxinemia of prematurity (p-value>0.05).\nHypothyroxinemia of prematurity or transient thyroid abnormalities in VLBW infants were not associated with poorer neurodevelopment and did not support the need for levothyroxine supplementation.", "The development of artificial intelligence has led researchers to study the ethical principles that should guide machine behavior. The challenge in building machine morality based on people's moral decisions, however, is accounting for the biases in human moral decision-making. In seven studies, this paper investigates how people's personal perspectives and decision-making modes affect their decisions in the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. Moreover, it determines the variations in people's moral decisions that can be attributed to the situational factors of the dilemmas. The reported studies demonstrate that people's moral decisions, regardless of the presented dilemma, are biased by their decision-making mode and personal perspective. Under intuitive moral decisions, participants shift more towards a deontological doctrine by sacrificing the passenger instead of the pedestrian. In addition, once the personal perspective is\u00a0made salient participants preserve the lives of that perspective, i.e. the passenger shifts towards sacrificing the pedestrian, and vice versa. These biases in people's moral decisions underline the social challenge in the design of a universal moral code for autonomous vehicles. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide directions for future research.", "We undertook this study in light of an uncontrolled rise of melanoma incidence and mortality rates in the United Kingdom (UK). We aim to assess the effectiveness of prevention and early melanoma diagnosis in the UK's National Health Service (NHS) in comparison to the Australian system that has limited the melanoma rise. We compare the prevention campaigns against skin cancer and the stage at which melanoma is diagnosed. We analyse key drivers of early diagnosis. Overall, Australia has performed better than the UK and provides an example for the UK's NHS for better preventing melanoma and diagnosing it. Technologies under development, such as tele-dermatology and artificial intelligence applications, could aid in making melanoma early diagnosis easier, more cost-efficient, and lessen the burden on health systems. Diagnoses also provide the data to help public health officials target prevention programs.", "Facilitation is common in the era of practice transformation. Much of the literature on practice facilitators focuses on the role of external facilitators who come into a practice to aid in practice transformation efforts. Our study sought to better understand the attributes of exemplary facilitators.\nWe conducted 10 structured interviews in four family medicine residencies.\nProgram directors easily identified internal staff who serve informally as exemplary facilitators. Despite varying jobs, they possess seven identifiable attributes within three broad domains: task orientation, relational skills, and emotional intelligence.\nGiven the increasing cost of practice transformation and the finite resources in many clinics, this study can help leaders identify current employees best suited for facilitation.", "Background and Purpose- Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the most common cause of vascular cognitive impairment, with a significant proportion of cases going on to develop dementia. We explore the extent to which diffusion tensor image segmentation technique (DSEG; which characterizes microstructural damage across the cerebrum) predicts both degree of cognitive decline and conversion to dementia, and hence may provide a useful prognostic procedure. Methods- Ninety-nine SVD patients (aged 43-89 years) underwent annual magnetic resonance imaging scanning (for 3 years) and cognitive assessment (for 5 years). DSEG-\u03b8 was used as a whole-cerebrum measure of SVD severity. Dementia diagnosis was based Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V criteria. Cox regression identified which DSEG measures and vascular risk factors were related to increased risk of dementia. Linear discriminant analysis was used to classify groups of stable versus subsequent dementia diagnosis individuals. Results- DSEG-\u03b8 was significantly related to decline in executive function and global cognition (P<0.001). Eighteen (18.2%) patients converted to dementia. Baseline DSEG-\u03b8 predicted dementia with a balanced classification rate=75.95% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.839. The best classification model included baseline DSEG-\u03b8, change in DSEG-\u03b8, age, sex, and premorbid intelligence quotient (balanced classification rate of 79.65%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.903). Conclusions- DSEG is a fully automatic technique that provides an accurate method for assessing brain microstructural damage in SVD from a single imaging modality (diffusion tensor imaging). DSEG-\u03b8 is an important tool in identifying SVD patients at increased risk of developing dementia and has potential as a clinical marker of SVD severity.", "The present study investigates skill transfer from Virtual Reality (VR) sports training to the real world, using the fast-paced sport of table tennis.\nA key assumption of VR training is that the learned skills and experiences transfer to the real world. Yet, in certain application areas, such as VR sports training, the research testing this assumption is sparse.\nReal-world table tennis performance was assessed using a mixed-model analysis of variance. The analysis comprised a between-subjects (VR training group vs control group) and a within-subjects (pre- and post-training) factor.\nFifty-seven participants (23 females) were either assigned to a VR training group (n = 29) or no-training control group (n = 28). During VR training, participants were immersed in competitive table tennis matches against an artificial intelligence opponent. An expert table tennis coach evaluated participants on real-world table tennis playing before and after the training phase. Blinded regarding participant's group assignment, the expert assessed participants' backhand, forehand and serving on quantitative aspects (e.g. count of rallies without errors) and quality of skill aspects (e.g. technique and consistency).\nVR training significantly improved participants' real-world table tennis performance compared to a no-training control group in both quantitative (p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.08) and quality of skill assessments (p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.10).\nThis study adds to a sparse yet expanding literature, demonstrating real-world skill transfer from Virtual Reality in an athletic task.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize the way in which medicine is practiced and thereby transform how healthcare is delivered. While in its nascence in terms of medical applications, it is imperative that the healthcare community plays an active role in helping co-design platforms for the future. This article outlines the Canadian context of AI development by touching on its history and current utility. It also outlines the importance of capital investment, sustainable design, and how Canada has a unique opportunity to be a global leader in AI infrastructure development.", "An increasing trend in funding towards artificial intelligence (AI) research in medicine has re-animated huge expectations for future applications. Obstetrics and gynaecology remain highly litigious specialities, accounting for a large proportion of indemnity payments due to poor outcomes. Several challenges have to be faced in order to improve current clinical practice in both obstetrics and gynaecology. For instance, a complete understanding of fetal physiology and establishing accurately predictive antepartum and intrapartum monitoring are yet to be achieved. In gynaecology, the complexity of molecular biology results in a lack of understanding of gynaecological cancer, which also contributes to poor outcomes. In this review, we aim to describe some important applications of AI in obstetrics and gynaecology. We also discuss whether AI can lead to a deeper understanding of pathophysiological concepts in obstetrics and gynaecology, allowing delineation of some grey zones, leading to improved healthcare provision. We conclude that AI can be used as a promising tool in obstetrics and gynaecology, as an approach to resolve several longstanding challenges; AI may also be a means to augment knowledge and assist clinicians in decision-making in a variety of areas in obstetrics and gynaecology.", "This study investigates the association between intelligence and brain power responses to a passive audiovisual stimulation. We measure the power of gamma-range steady-state responses (SSRs) as well as intelligence and other aspects of neurocognitive function in 40 healthy males born in 1953. The participants are a part of a Danish birth cohort study and the data therefore include additional information measured earlier in life. Our main power measure is the difference in power between a visual stimulation and a combined audiovisual stimulation. We hypothesize and establish empirically that the power measure is associated with intelligence. In particular, we find a highly significant correlation between the power measure and present intelligence scores. The association is robust to controlling for size-at-birth measures, length of education, speed of processing as well as a range of other potentially confounding factors. Interestingly, we find that intelligence scores measured earlier in life (childhood, youth, late midlife), are also correlated with the present-day power measure, suggesting a deep connection between intelligence and the power measure. Finally, we find that the power measure has a high sensitivity for detection of an intelligence score below the average.", "Medical decision-making is revolutionizing with the introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Yet, traditional algorithms using biomarkers to optimize drug treatment continue to be important and necessary. In this context, early diagnosis and rational antimicrobial therapy of sepsis and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are vital to prevent morbidity and mortality. In this study we report an original cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of using a procalcitonin (PCT)-based decision algorithm to guide antibiotic prescription for hospitalized sepsis and LRTI patients versus standard care. We conducted a CEA using a decision-tree model before and after the implementation of PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship (ABS) using real-world U.S. hospital-specific data. The CEA included societal and hospital perspectives with the time horizon covering the length of hospital stay. The main outcomes were average total costs per patient, and numbers of patients with Clostridium difficile and antibiotic resistance (ABR) infections. We found that health care with the PCT decision algorithm for hospitalized sepsis and LRTI patients resulted in shorter length of stay, reduced antibiotic use, fewer mechanical ventilation days, and lower numbers of patients with C. difficile and ABR infections. The PCT-guided health care resulted in cost savings of $25,611 (49% reduction from standard care) for sepsis and $3630 (23% reduction) for LRTI, on average per patient. In conclusion, the PCT decision algorithm for ABS in sepsis and LRTI might offer cost savings in comparison with standard care in a U.S. hospital context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first health economic analysis on PCT implementation using U.S. real-world data. We suggest that future CEA studies in other U.S. and worldwide settings are warranted in the current age when PCT and other decision algorithms are increasingly deployed in precision therapeutics and evidence-based medicine.", "Physical activity (PA) can be a mechanism that develops emotions. Emotional intelligence (EI) is related to significant public health and psychological benefits. However, there is little information about the relationships between PA and EI dimensions: emotional attention, clarity, and repair. This study examined the possible relationships between these variables in undergraduate students from Madrid. As a secondary aim, sex differences in PA domains and EI dimensions were examined.\nA total of 2960 (21.34\u2009\u00b1\u20094.34\u2009years) undergraduate students from Madrid (Spain) fulfilled the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24) and Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). We used a MANOVA to compare EI and PA levels according to sex. Different linear regressions were conducted to calculate the PA and age prediction power based on EI.\nWe found a significant association between EI dimensions and PA levels, although these relationships were small. Fully adjusted linear regression showed that sex and leisure-time PA (LTPA) were associated of emotional attention (r2c\u2009=\u2009.025). Sex, age, and LTPA were associated of emotional repair (r2c\u2009=\u2009.024). There were statistically significant differences in EI by sex (p\u2009\u2264\u2009.001; \u03b72p = .039), with higher scores in emotional attention for women (p\u2009\u2264\u2009.001) and emotional clarity (p\u2009\u2264\u2009.001) and repair (p\u2009\u2264\u2009.001) for men. PA levels differed according to sex (p\u2009\u2264\u2009.001; \u03b72p = .038). Men show higher scores in LTPA levels (p\u2009=\u2009.002) and occupational PA (p\u2009\u2264\u2009.001).\nUndergraduate students with higher levels of LTPA showed a better score on EI, specifically in emotional attention and emotional repair. However, these associations and the predictive power of LTPA regarding emotional attention and emotional repair were weak. Men engaged in more LTPA and occupational PA and had higher emotional clarity and emotional repair than women. However, women had higher emotional attention.", "We offer a friendly criticism of May's fantastic book on moral reasoning: It is overly charitable to the argument that moral disagreement undermines moral knowledge. To highlight the role that reasoning quality plays in moral judgments, we review literature that he did not mention showing that individual differences in intelligence and cognitive reflection explain much of moral disagreement. The burden is on skeptics of moral knowledge to show that moral disagreement arises from non-rational origins.", "Zimbabwe faces an uncertain future for condom funding and potential condom insecurity as international donors prioritize creating more self-sustaining markets and the government identifies how to best ensure access and uptake. We tested the impact of an intensive intervention on demand and supply after a price increase to the social marketed condom, Protector Plus. The study occurred during a deteriorating economy and pressure to reach sustainability quickly. We highlight where strategic donor investments can impact condom programming and markets.\nWe randomized ten purposively selected districts in Zimbabwe and assigned them to two study groups to test the impact of an intensive social marketing intervention. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental study conducted within a larger market strengthening context. We tracked sales of Protector Plus and distribution of the public sector condom monthly. We conducted baseline and follow-up surveys among consumers and traders, and used the difference-in-difference method to test the intervention's impact on condom preferences and brand equity.\nProtector Plus sales rebounded to previous levels after the price increase. We detected no significant difference in sales between the experimental and control districts. Among traders, there were no significant differences in brand preference for Protector Plus attributed to the intervention. Among consumers, there was a significant increase in emotional attachment and beliefs about condom efficacy in the experimental districts.\nStudy findings demonstrate where international donor and government investments can impact condom programming and condom markets. Broader findings from the intervention highlight where investments can improve condom coverage, cost recovery, and collaboration between the public, social marketing, and commercial sectors. Strategic investments for strengthening condom markets include: consumer research to segment markets, willingness to pay studies to set price points, distribution system improvements to increase efficiency, intensive demand generation to increase demand and use, market facilitation across sectors, and market intelligence to inform decision making. When a disciplined social marketing approach is used, the market benefits: subsidies can be better targeted, branded products can appeal to the right audiences, and room can be made for the commercial sector to enter the market.", "Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a prevalent, neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 2% to 5% of children, which is characterised by fine and gross motor problems. Children with DCD have been shown to be less fit and physically active than other children; however, the direction of causality is unknown as previous studies have typically been done in older children when the differences in fitness and physical activity are already present. The aim of the Coordination and Activity Tracking in Children (CATCH) study is to specifically address the issue of precedence by recruiting a large sample of children in early childhood.\nCATCH comprises a community-based sample of parents and children 4 to 5 years of age divided into two groups: at risk for DCD (rDCD; n=287) and typically developing (TD; n=301). Inclusion in the rDCD group required a score at or below the 16th percentile on a standardised test of motor coordination and a score above 70 on a standardised test of intelligence.\nChildren in the rDCD group contained a higher proportion of males (67% vs 48%, \u03c72=21.9, p<0.001). Children in the rDCD group had lower mean IQs, aerobic and musculoskeletal fitness than children in the TD group (p<0.001 for all). There were no differences observed between groups for body composition or physical activity. Parent characteristics did not differ, with one exception: partners of reporting parents of rDCD children were less likely to hold a university degree (44% vs 57%, \u03c72=7.4, p=0.004). According to parent report, rDCD children experienced more problems in self-care, school and leisure activities (p<0.001 for all).\nChildren are being followed up annually for 3 years. At each follow-up, motor coordination testing is repeated, and data are collected on physical activity, fitness and social-emotional problems.", "Due to the rapid technological evolution and communications accessibility, data generated from different sources of information show an exponential growth behavior. That is, volume of data samples that need to be analyzed are getting larger, so the methods for its processing have to adapt to this condition, focusing mainly on ensuring the computation is efficient, especially when the analysis tools are based on computational intelligence techniques. As we know, if you do not have a good control of the handling of the volume of the data, some techniques that are based on learning iterative processes could represent an excessive load of computation and could take a prohibitive time in trying to find a solution that could not come close to desired. There are learning methods known as full batch, online and mini-batch, and they represent a good strategy to this problem since they are oriented to the processing of data according to the size or volume of available data samples that require analysis. In this first approach, synthetic datasets with a small and medium volume were used, since the main objective is to define its implementation and in experimentation phase through regression analysis obtain information that allows us to assess the performance and behavior of different learning methods under distinct conditions. To carry out this study, a Mamdani based neuro-fuzzy system with center-of-sets defuzzification with support of multiple inputs and outputs was designed and implemented that had the flexibility to use any of the three learning methods, which were implemented within the training process. Finally, results show that the learning method with best performances was Mini-Batch when compared to full batch and online learning methods. The results obtained by mini-batch learning method are as follows; mean correlation coefficient [Formula: see text] with 0.8268 and coefficient of determination [Formula: see text] with 0.7444, and is also the method with better control of the dispersion between the results obtained from the 30 experiments executed per each dataset processed.", "Living longer with sustainable quality of life is becoming increasingly important in aging populations. Understanding associative biological mechanisms have proven daunting, because of multigenicity and population heterogeneity. Although Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) could help, na\u00efve adoption is ill advised. We hold the view that model organisms are better suited for big-data analytics but might lack relevance because they do not immediately reflect the human condition. Resolving this hurdle and bridging the human-model organism gap will require some finesse. This includes improving signal:noise ratios by appropriate contextualization of high-throughput data, establishing consistency across multiple high-throughput platforms, and adopting supporting technologies that provide useful in silico and in vivo validation strategies.", "Subjective well-being (SWB) is a basic component of the health of children and adolescents. Studies of SWB in gifted students are scarce and show contradictory results. Some researchers consider these groups to be vulnerable, and according to some reports they are more often involved in situations of harassment as victims and/or harassers. Emotional intelligence (EI) is related to SWB and can be a protective factor in these situations. However, the underlying mechanism remains relatively unexplored, especially in the affective dimension of SWB. The present study develops and tests a model for the mediating role of mood in the relationship between EI and SWB. The participants were 273 Spanish students aged 8 to 18 years, distributed into two samples: sample 1, gifted students, and sample 2, unidentified students. The results showed that (1) gifted students exhibited lower scores in EI (specifically, in clarity) and SWB (specifically, in positive experiences) and higher scores on the sadness dimension of mood states and that (2) EI was positively related to SWB, and mood was a significant mediator in the relationship between EI and SWB. The mediating role of the positive mood is given in both groups; however, the negative mood only mediates this relationship in gifted students. The results are discussed, theoretical and practical contributions to the literature are proposed, and implications for parents and teachers are suggested.", "Twin registries have developed as a valuable resource for the study of many aspects of disease and society over the years in many different countries. A number of these registries include large numbers of twins with data collected at varying information levels for twin cohorts over the past several decades. More recent expansion of twin datasets has allowed for the collection of genetic data, together with many other levels of 'omic' information along with multiple demographic, physiological, health outcomes and other measures typically used in epidemiologic research. Other twin data sources outside these registries reflect research interests in particular aspects of disease or specific phenotypic assessment. Twin registries have the potential to play a key role in many aspects of the artificial intelligence/machine learning-driven projects of the future and will continue to keep adapting to the changing research landscape.", "Preterm childbirth increases the risk of developmental problems. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of temperament and attention on the cognition of school-age children who were born preterm, controlling for socioeconomic variables.\nThe sample was composed of 50 six-year-old children who were born preterm with very low birth weight. The children were evaluated using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) and the Cancellation Attention Test. The mothers were interviewed using the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ). Statistical multiple linear regression analyses were performed.\n70% of the children presented average or above-average full intellectual quotient (IQ). In the attention total score, 74% of the children were also within the average range or above. High verbal IQ associated with high maternal schooling explained 73% variability of the full IQ. High attention and maternal schooling, associated with children's temperament with more effortful control, explained 35% variability of the verbal IQ. High attention, associated with high maternal schooling and socioeconomic level, explained 37% variability of the performance IQ. The neonatal clinical variables (gestational age, birth weight, 5th-minute Apgar, and length of stay in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and hospital) were not predictors of cognitive outcomes.\nThe majority of the children who were born preterm presented average or above-average cognitive and attentional performances at school age, demonstrating potential resources for learning. Taken together, attention and temperament, associated with maternal schooling and socioeconomic status, were predictors of cognitive outcomes of children born preterm at school age.", "Recently, digital health has gained the attention of physicians, patients, and healthcare industries. Digital health, a broad umbrella term, can be defined as an emerging health area that uses brand new digital or medical technologies involving genomics, big data, wearables, mobile applications, and artificial intelligence. Digital health has been highlighted as a way of realizing precision medicine, and in addition is expected to become synonymous with health itself with the rapid digitization of all health-related data. In this article, we first define digital health by reviewing the diverse range of definitions among academia and government agencies. Based on these definitions, we then review the current status of digital health, mainly in Korea, suggest points that are missing from the discussion or ought to be added, and provide future directions of digital health in clinical practice by pointing out certain key points.", "The 'precision medicine' refers to the generation of identification and classification criteria for advanced taxonomy of patients, exploiting advanced models to infer optimized clinical decisions for each disease phenotype.\nThe current article reviews new advances in the past 18 months on the microbiomics science intended as new discipline contributing to advanced 'precision medicine'. Recently published data highlight the importance of multidimensional data in the description of deep disease phenotypes, including microbiome and immune profiling, and support the efficacy of the systems medicine to better stratify patients, hence optimizing diagnostics, clinical management and response to treatments.\nThe articles referenced in this review help inform the reader on new decision-support systems that can be based on multiomics patients' data including microbiome and immune profiling. These harmonized and integrated data can be elaborated by artificial intelligence to generate optimized diagnostic pipelines and clinical interventions.", "Treatment planning is an essential step of the radiotherapy workflow. It has become more sophisticated over the past couple of decades with the help of computer science, enabling planners to design highly complex radiotherapy plans to minimize the normal tissue damage while persevering sufficient tumor control. As a result, treatment planning has become more labor intensive, requiring hours or even days of planner effort to optimize an individual patient case in a trial-and-error fashion. More recently, artificial intelligence has been utilized to automate and improve various aspects of medical science. For radiotherapy treatment planning, many algorithms have been developed to better support planners. These algorithms focus on automating the planning process and/or optimizing dosimetric trade-offs, and they have already made great impact on improving treatment planning efficiency and plan quality consistency. In this review, the smart planning tools in current clinical use are summarized in 3 main categories: automated rule implementation and reasoning, modeling of prior knowledge in clinical practice, and multicriteria optimization. Novel artificial intelligence-based treatment planning applications, such as deep learning-based algorithms and emerging research directions, are also reviewed. Finally, the challenges of artificial intelligence-based treatment planning are discussed for future works.", "The wearable smart detection of body biomolecules and biomarkers is being of significance in the practical fields. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a product of some enzyme-catalyzed biomolecular reactions. The detection of H2O2 could reflect the concentration information of the enzyme reaction biomolecule substrate such as glucose. A high-performance berlin green (BG) carbon ink for monitoring H2O2 was prepared in this work. And we have successfully developed the wearable smartsensors for detecting H2O2 and glucose based on one-step fabricated BG arrays by screen-printing technology. Comparing with other detection methods, these sensors are wearable, movable, flexible and biocompatible for monitoring biomolecules. As a result, the sensors exhibited good sensitivity, specificity, stability and reproductivity towards H2O2 and glucose. Additionally, there also received stable response after near one hundred times stretching and thousands of bending. Moreover, the wearable sensors could be easily remotely controlled by a smart phone, when integrated with wireless into the device. In prospective studies, the one-step fabricated wearable smartsensors is of great significance in developing a straightforward, highly-efficient and low-cost method for actual detection of biomolecules reflecting body health status, and would potentially be applied in the artificial intelligence (AI) fields.", "To evaluate the clinical usefulness of the Korean Developmental Screening Test (K-DST) via comparison with Korean Ages and Stages Questionnaire (K-ASQ) for the diagnosis of developmental delay in pediatric patients.\nThe K-DST and K-ASQ were used to screen pediatric patients who visited the hospital for evaluation and diagnosis of delayed development. Korean Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II (K-BSID-II) or Korean Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence III (K-WPPSI-III) were used for the standardized assessment. Moreover, the final clinical diagnosis was confirmed by three expert physicians (rehabilitation doctor, psychiatrist, and neurologist). The sensitivity and specificity of each screening tool for the final diagnosis were investigated and correlated with standardized assessments.\nA total of 145 pediatric consultations were conducted, which included 123 developmental disorders (40 autism spectrum disorders, 46 global developmental delay/intellectual disability, and 37 developmental language disorders) and another 22 that were not associated with any such disorders. The sensitivity and specificity of K-DST based on the final clinical diagnosis were 82.9% and 90.9%, respectively, which were not significantly different from that of K-ASQ (83.7% and 77.3%). Both K-DST and K-ASQ showed good correlation with K-BSID-II and K-WPPSI-III. No significant difference was found between the K-DST and K-ASQ measures.\nK-DST is an excellent screening tool and is expected to replace K-ASQ with high validity.", "The aims were to estimate the association between intelligence measured in young adulthood and risk of alcohol use disorders (AUD) in men and to investigate the potential modification of this association by psychiatric disorders, parental AUD and parental psychiatric disorders.\nProspective cohort study based on a linkage of intelligence test scores from draft board examinations and register data on AUD diagnoses during 36 years of follow-up.\nDenmark.\n3287 Danish men from the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort (born 1959-1961) who appeared before the draft board at a mean age of 18.7 years.\nFirst registration with AUD during follow-up was the primary outcome. Information on AUD was based on diagnoses retrieved from national hospital and outpatient treatment registers, defined according to the International Classification of Diseases.\n361 (11.0%) men were registered with AUD during follow-up. Low intelligence scores were associated with increased odds of AUD adjusting for parental AUD, parental psychiatric disorders, maternal smoking during pregnancy, birth weight, maternal age at birth, parity and childhood socioeconomic position (OR per SD decrease in intelligence=1.69, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.92). Separate analyses indicated significant interaction (p<0.001) between intelligence and psychiatric disorders. The adjusted OR per SD decrease in intelligence score was 2.04 (95% CI 1.67 to 2.49) in men without other psychiatric disorders whereas the OR was 1.21 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.46) in men with other psychiatric disorders. No interaction was found between intelligence and parental AUD or between intelligence and parental psychiatric disorders.\nThe association between intelligence in young adulthood and AUD is modified by other psychiatric disorders as low intelligence is primarily a risk factor for men without other psychiatric disorders. Future studies should take other psychiatric disorders into account when investigating associations between intelligence and AUD.", "Drug-resistant epilepsy is the main risk factor for future intellectual disability in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. Clinical epileptic seizures are often preceded by electroencephalographic changes, which provide an opportunity for preventive treatment. We evaluated the neuropsychologic and epilepsy outcomes at school age in children with tuberous sclerosis complex who received preventive antiepileptic treatment in infancy.\nWe performed a prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial with 14 infants diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis complex in whom serial electroencephalographic recordings were performed and preventive treatment with vigabatrin initiated when active epileptic discharges were detected. An age-matched control group consisted of 31 infants with tuberous sclerosis complex in whom treatment with vigabatrin was given only after onset of clinical seizures. Results of clinical assessment of epilepsy and cognitive outcomes were analyzed.\nAll patients in the preventive group (n\u00a0=\u00a014) and 25 of 31 patients in the standard treatment group were followed through minimum age five years, median 8.8 and 8.0\u00a0years in the preventive and standard groups, respectively. The median intelligence quotient was 94 for the preventive group when compared with 46 for the standard group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.03). Seven of 14 patients (50%) in the preventive group never had a clinical seizure when compared with one of 25 patients (5%) in the standard treatment group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001).\nThis study provides evidence that preventive antiepileptic treatment in infants with tuberous sclerosis complex improves long-term epilepsy control and cognitive outcome at school age.", "Correlation of pathology reports with radiology examinations has long been of interest to radiologists and helps to facilitate peer learning. Such correlation also helps meet regulatory requirements, ensures quality, and supports multidisciplinary conferences and patient care. Additional offshoots of such correlation include evaluating for and ensuring concordance of pathology results with radiology interpretation and procedures as well as ensuring specimen adequacy after biopsy. For much of the history of radiology, this correlation has been done manually, which is time consuming and cumbersome and provides coverage of only a fraction of radiology examinations performed. Electronic storage and indexing of radiology and pathology information laid the foundation for easier access and for the development of automated artificial intelligence methods to match pathology information with radiology reports. More recent techniques have resulted in near comprehensive coverage of radiology examinations with methods to present results and solicit feedback from end users. Newer deep learning language modeling techniques will advance these methods by providing more robust automated and comprehensive radiology-pathology correlation with the ability to rapidly, flexibly, and iteratively tune models to site and user preference.", "Experimental research of cutting force components during dry face milling operations are presented in the paper. The study was provided when milling of ductile cast iron alloyed with copper and its austempered ductile iron after the proper austempering process. In the study, virtual instrumentation designed for cutting forces components monitoring was used. During the research, orthogonal cutting forces components versus time were monitored and relationship of cutting forces components versus speed, feed and depth of cut were determined by artificial neural network and response surface methodology. An analysis was made regarding the consistency of the measured cutting forces and the values obtained from the model supported by an artificial neural network for the investigated interval of the cutting regime. Based on the results, an analysis of the feasibility of the application of austempered ductile iron in the industrial sector with the aspect of machinability as well as the application of the models based on artificial intelligence, was given. At the end of the presentation, the influence of the aforementioned cutting regimes on cutting force components is presented as well.", "Skin is the largest organ of the human body and can perceive and respond to complex environmental stimulations. Recently, the development of electronic skin (E-skin) for the mimicry of the human sensory system has drawn great attention due to its potential applications in wearable human health monitoring and care systems, advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-machine interfaces. Tactile sense is one of the most important senses of human skin that has attracted special attention. The ability to obtain unique functions using diverse assembly processible methods has rapidly advanced the use of graphene, the most celebrated two-dimensional material, in electronic tactile sensing devices. With a special emphasis on the works achieved since 2016, this review begins with the assembly and modification of graphene materials and then critically and comprehensively summarizes the most advanced material assembly methods, device construction technologies and signal characterization approaches in pressure and strain detection based on graphene and its derivative materials. This review emphasizes on: (1) the underlying working principles of these types of sensors and the unique roles and advantages of graphene materials; (2) state-of-the-art protocols recently developed for high-performance tactile sensing, including representative examples; and (3) perspectives and current challenges for graphene-based tactile sensors in E-skin applications. A summary of these cutting-edge developments intends to provide readers with a deep understanding of the future design of high-quality tactile sensing devices and paves a path for their future commercial applications in the field of E-skin.", "Rapid technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) methods have fueled explosive growth in decision tools being marketed by a rapidly growing number of companies. AI developments are being driven largely by computer scientists, informaticians, engineers, and businesspeople, with much less direct participation by radiologists. Participation by radiologists in AI is largely restricted to educational efforts to familiarize them with the tools and promising results, but techniques to help them decide which AI tools should be used in their practices and to how to quantify their value are not being addressed. This article focuses on the role of radiologists in imaging AI and suggests specific ways they can be engaged by (1) considering the clinical need for AI tools in specific clinical use cases, (2) undertaking formal evaluation of AI tools they are considering adopting in their practices, and (3) maintaining their expertise and guarding against the pitfalls of overreliance on technology.", "Today, there are a lack of studies focusing on the relationship between occupational complexity and executive functioning. This is noteworthy since executive functions are core aspects of cognitive processing. The present study was aimed to investigate if three occupational complexity factors (with data, people, and things) of main lifetime occupation were related to performance in executive tasks (inhibition, switching, updating). We analyzed cross-sectional data that were available for 225 participants aged 50-75 years. Results from structural equation models showed that higher complexity levels of working with data were related to lower error rates in the updating component of cognitive control. In addition, higher rates of complexity working with people was associated with lower error rates in task-switching, which also persisted after adjustment of fluid intelligence. Complexity with things, however, was not related to performance in the executive tasks. Future studies would benefit from a longitudinal design to investigate if the results from this study also hold in the long term and to further investigate the directionality between factors.", "One of the ways in which modern radiology is manifesting itself in higher education and research is through the increasing importance of scientific mobility. This article seeks to provide an overview and a prospective of radiology fellows in their last year of training about the current trends and policy tools for promoting mobility among young radiologists, especially inside the European Union. Nowadays, the need to promote international cooperation is even greater to ensure that the best evidence-based medical practices become a common background of a next cross-border generation of radiologists. Organisations such as the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) are called upon to play as guarantors of the training of young radiologists building know-how and world-class excellence. Today, it is not just being certified radiologist that matters, the place where the training was done plays an important role in enhancing chances when applying for a high-level job or fellowship. The article argues that the mobility of radiology trainees is an indispensable prerequisite to face new challenges, including the application of artificial intelligence to medical imaging, which will require a large multicentre collaboration.", "Diabetes is a global eye health issue. Given the rising in diabetes prevalence and ageing population, this poses significant challenge to perform diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening for these patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning and deep learning have been adopted by various groups to develop automated DR detection algorithms. This article aims to describe the state-of-art AI DR screening technologies that have been described in the literature, some of which are already commercially available. All these technologies were designed using different training datasets and technical methodologies. Although many groups have published robust diagnostic performance of the AI algorithms for DR screening, future research is required to address several challenges, for examples medicolegal implications, ethics, and clinical deployment model in order to expedite the translation of these novel technologies into the healthcare setting.\n\u6458\u8981: \u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u6027\u7684\u773c\u79d1\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898, \u968f\u7740\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u75c5\u7387\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u53e3\u8001\u9f84\u5316, \u5bf9\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8(DR)\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5f88\u591a\u56e2\u961f\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd(AI)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5, \u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60(ML)\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60(DL)\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4bDR\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u73b0\u5df2\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684AI\u7b5b\u67e5DR\u6280\u672f, \u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u5df2\u7ecf\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u90fd\u662f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bb8\u591a\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eAI\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u7b5b\u67e5DR\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd, \u4f46\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218, \u4f8b\u5982\u5bf9\u6cd5\u533b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd, \u52a0\u901f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u5411\u533b\u7597\u673a\u6784\u8f6c\u5316\u6240\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b49\u7b49\u3002.", "Currently, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology, particularly machine learning (ML), has become a reality in clinical practice. Since the end of the last century, several ML algorithms have been introduced for a wide range of common imaging tasks, not only for diagnostic purposes but also for image acquisition and postprocessing. AI is now recognized to be a driving initiative in every aspect of radiology. There is growing evidence of the advantages of AI in radiology creating seamless imaging workflows for radiologists or even replacing radiologists. Most of the current AI methods have some internal and external disadvantages that are impeding their ultimate implementation in the clinical arena. As such, AI can be considered a portion of a business trying to be introduced in the health care market. For this reason, this review analyzes the current status of AI, and specifically ML, applied to radiology from the scope of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis.", "The serotonin system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa (AN). A recent report proposed that body image distortion (BID), a core symptom of AN, may relate to abnormalities of the serotonin system, especially the serotonin transporter (5HTT). Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of underweight patients with active AN reported alterations in serotonin receptors, but not 5HTT. Here, we aimed to disclose the clinicopathophysiology of AN by focusing on 5HTT and cognitive functions, including BID, in groups with active AN. Twenty-two underweight female patients with AN (12 restricting-type AN (ANR); 10 binge-eating/purging-type AN (ANBP)) and 20 age-matched healthy female subjects underwent PET with a 5HTT radioligand [11C]DASB. The binding potential (BPND) of [11C]DASB was estimated semiquantitatively, and clinical data from Raven's colored progressive matrices for general intelligence, the Stroop test for focused attention, the Iowa gambling task for decision making and a dot-probe task designed for BID were compared with the levels of BPND in different groups. [11C]DASB BPND was significantly decreased in the medial parietal cortex in patients with AN and in the dorsal raphe in patients with ANR compared with healthy subjects (p\u202f<\u202f.05 corrected). Patients with ANR showed a significantly negative correlation between [11C]DASB BPND in the dorsal raphe and performance on the dot-probe task (p\u202f<\u202f.05 corrected). While reduced 5HTT in the medial parietal cortex (the somatosensory association area) is pathophysiologically important in AN in general, additional 5HTT reduction in the dorsal raphe as seen in ANR is implicated for the clinicopathophysiological relevance.", "Nuclear cardiology has unique advantages compared to other modalities, since the image analysis is already much more automated compared to what is currently clinically performed for CT, MR, or echocardiography imaging. The diverse image and clinical data available to assess coronary disease function, perfusion, flow, and associated CT data provide new opportunities, but logistically these additional assessments increase the overall complexity of SPECT/PET reporting, necessitating additional expertise and time. The advances in artificial intelligence software can be leveraged to obtain comprehensive risk predictions and diagnoses from all available data. They will allow nuclear cardiology to retain competitive edge compared to other modalities and improve its overall clinical utility. These tools will enhance diagnosis and risk prediction beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of data by physicians.", "Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and \u03b2-thalassemia trait (\u03b2-TT) are the most common types of microcytic hypochromic anemias. The similarity and the nature of anemia-related symptoms pose a foremost challenge for discriminating between IDA and \u03b2-TT. Currently, advances in technology have gave rise to computer-based decision-making systems. Therefore, advances in artificial intelligence have led to the emergence of intelligent systems and the development of tools that can assist physicians in the diagnosis and decision-making.\nThe aim of the present study was to develop a neural network based model (Artificial Neural Network) for accurate and timely manner of differential diagnosis of IDA and \u03b2-TT in comparison with traditional methods.\nIn this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) model as the first precise intelligent method was developed for differential diagnosis of IDA and \u03b2-TT. Data set was retrieved from Complete Blood Count (CBC) test factors of 268 individuals referred to Padad private clinical laboratory at Ahvaz, Iran in 2018. ANN models with different topologies were developed and CBC indices were examined for diagnosis of IDA and \u03b2-TT. The proposed model was simulated using MATLAB software package version 2018. The results showed the best network architecture based on the advanced multilayer algorithm (4 input factors, 70 neurons with acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy). Finally, the results obtained from ANN diagnostic model was compared to existing discriminating indexes.\nThe results of this model showed that the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of the proposed diagnostic system were 92.33%, 93.13%, and 92.5%, respectably; i.e. the model could diagnose frequent occurrence of IDA in patients with \u03b2-TT.\nThe results and evaluation of the developed model showed that the proposed neural network model has a proper accuracy and generalizability based on the initial factors of CBC testing compared to existing methods. This model can replace the high-cost methods and discriminating indices to distinguish IDA from \u03b2-TT and assist in accurate and timely manner diagnosis.", "To establish and validate a universal artificial intelligence (AI) platform for collaborative management of cataracts involving multilevel clinical scenarios and explored an AI-based medical referral pattern to improve collaborative efficiency and resource coverage.\nThe training and validation datasets were derived from the Chinese Medical Alliance for Artificial Intelligence, covering multilevel healthcare facilities and capture modes. The datasets were labelled using a three-step strategy: (1) capture mode recognition; (2) cataract diagnosis as a normal lens, cataract or a postoperative eye and (3) detection of referable cataracts with respect to aetiology and severity. Moreover, we integrated the cataract AI agent with a real-world multilevel referral pattern involving self-monitoring at home, primary healthcare and specialised hospital services.\nThe universal AI platform and multilevel collaborative pattern showed robust diagnostic performance in three-step tasks: (1) capture mode recognition (area under the curve (AUC) 99.28%-99.71%), (2) cataract diagnosis (normal lens, cataract or postoperative eye with AUCs of 99.82%, 99.96% and 99.93% for mydriatic-slit lamp mode and AUCs >99% for other capture modes) and (3) detection of referable cataracts (AUCs >91% in all tests). In the real-world tertiary referral pattern, the agent suggested 30.3% of people be 'referred', substantially increasing the ophthalmologist-to-population service ratio by 10.2-fold compared with the traditional pattern.\nThe universal AI platform and multilevel collaborative pattern showed robust diagnostic performance and effective service for cataracts. The context of our AI-based medical referral pattern will be extended to other common disease conditions and resource-intensive situations.", "The relative importance of different factors in the development of human skills has been extensively discussed. Research on expertise indicates that focused practice may be the sole determinant of skill, while intelligence researchers underline the relative importance of abilities at even the highest level of skill. There is indeed a large body of research that acknowledges the role of both factors in skill development and retention. It is, however, unknown how intelligence and practice come together to enable the acquisition and retention of complex skills across the life span. Instead of focusing on the 2 factors, intelligence and practice, in isolation, here we look at their interplay throughout development. In a longitudinal study that tracked chess players throughout their careers, we show that both intelligence and practice positively affect the acquisition and retention of chess skill. Importantly, the nonlinear interaction between the 2 factors revealed that more intelligent individuals benefited more from practice. With the same amount of practice, they acquired chess skill more quickly than less intelligent players, reached a higher peak performance, and arrested decline in older age. Our research demonstrates the futility of scrutinizing the relative importance of highly intertwined factors in human development.", "Despite a growing number of studies on bilingual advantages in executive functions (EF), their findings have been inconsistent. To shed light on this issue, we aimed to address both the conceptual and methodological limitations that have prevailed in the literature: failure to consider diverse bilingual experiences when assessing bilingual advantages or to address the task impurity problems that can arise with EF tasks. Drawing on the adaptive control hypothesis and control process model of code-switching, we adopted theory-driven and latent variable approaches to examine the relations between bilingual interactional contexts and EF. By administering 9 EF tasks to 175 bilingual participants over multiple sessions, we found that bilinguals' dual-language context significantly predicted the latent variable of task-switching, while a dense code-switching context significantly predicted 2 latent variables of inhibitory control and goal maintenance. These findings remained robust after controlling for potential confounds of demographics, socioeconomic status, nonverbal intelligence, and unintended language-switching tendency. Our study suggests that bilingual interactional context is a key language experience that modulates bilingual advantages in EF.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ultrasound is becoming more mature and getting closer to routine clinical applications in recent times because of an increased need for efficient and objective acquisition and evaluation of ultrasound images. Because ultrasound images involve operator-, patient-, and scanner-dependent variations, the adaptation of classical machine learning methods to clinical applications becomes challenging. With their self-learning ability, deep-learning (DL) methods are able to harness exponentially growing graphics processing unit computing power to identify abstract and complex imaging features. This\u00a0has given rise to tremendous opportunities such as providing robust and generalizable AI models for improving image acquisition, real-time assessment of image quality, objective diagnosis and detection of diseases, and optimizing ultrasound clinical workflow. In this report, the authors review current DL approaches and research directions in rapidly advancing ultrasound technology and present their outlook on future directions and trends for DL techniques to further improve diagnosis, reduce health care cost, and optimize ultrasound clinical workflow.", "Injuries exert an enormous impact on athletes and teams. This is seen especially in professional soccer, with a marked negative impact on team performance and considerable costs of rehabilitation for players. Existing studies provide some preliminary understanding of which factors are mostly associated with injury risk, but scientific systematic evaluation of the potential of statistical models in forecasting injuries is still missing. Some factors raise the risk of a sport injury, but there are also elements that predispose athletes to sports injuries. The biological mechanisms involved in non-contact musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries are poorly understood. Genetic risk factors may be associated with susceptibility to injuries, and may exert marked influence on recovery times. Athletes are complex systems, and depend on internal and external factors to attain and maintain stability of their health and their performance. Organisms, participants or traits within a dynamic system adapt and change when factors within that system change. Scientists routinely predict risk in a variety of dynamic systems, including weather, political forecasting and projecting traffic fatalities and the last years have started the use of predictive models in the human health industry. We propose that the use of artificial intelligence may well help in assessing risk and help to predict the occurrence of sport injuries.", "Molecular docking is an established in silico structure-based method widely used in drug discovery. Docking enables the identification of novel compounds of therapeutic interest, predicting ligand-target interactions at a molecular level, or delineating structure-activity relationships (SAR), without knowing a priori the chemical structure of other target modulators. Although it was originally developed to help understanding the mechanisms of molecular recognition between small and large molecules, uses and applications of docking in drug discovery have heavily changed over the last years. In this review, we describe how molecular docking was firstly applied to assist in drug discovery tasks. Then, we illustrate newer and emergent uses and applications of docking, including prediction of adverse effects, polypharmacology, drug repurposing, and target fishing and profiling, discussing also future applications and further potential of this technique when combined with emergent techniques, such as artificial intelligence.", "Personal genomic information benefits from accumulated big data and its application is no longer limited to scientific research. Presently, it is undergoing the transformation to daily medical practice. Systematic arrangement, archiving and rational utilization of disease-related genomic information is an important foundation of future precision medicine. Hemoglobinopathy is prevalent in southern China, but its molecular pathological basis has racial specificity. To facilitate clinical diagnosis and genetic screening of hemoglobinopathy in southern China, we established the LOVD gene data management system for the variation and phenotype spectrum of hemoglobinopathy. Then we designed an integrated and efficient on-line auxiliary accurate diagnosis and risk assessment system in order to assist clinicians to make comprehensive diagnosis and genetic counseling in a short time based on cloud standardized annotated library of specific hemoglobinopathy variants and diagnostic repository. The methodology and experience of improving the clinical decision-making efficiency of diseases with big data and artificial intelligence technology can be used as an example in the clinical and preventive application of other diseases.", "In 1959, Maroteaux and Lamy initially designated pseudoachondroplasia as a distinct dysplasia different from achondroplasia the most common form of skeletal dysplasia. Pseudoachondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the collagen oligomeric matrix protein gene (COMP) gene on chromosome 19p13.1-p12 encoding the COMP. The COMP gene mutations result in rendering the articular and growth plate cartilages incapable of withstanding routine biomechanical loads with resultant deformity of the joints. The purpose of the study was to characterize the typical orthopaedic findings in pseudoachondroplasia.\nThe charts and radiographs of 141 patients with pseudoachondroplasia were analyzed. This cohort, to our knowledge, represents the largest group of patients describing the typical orthopaedic manifestations of pseudoachondroplasia.\nPatients with pseudoachondroplasia have normal craniofacial appearance with normal intelligence. Short stature is not present at birth and generally appears by two to four years of age. The condition is a form of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and the long bones are characterized by dysplastic changes in the epiphysis, metaphysis and vertebral bodies. Radiographically the long bones have altered the appearance and structure of the epiphyses with small irregularly formed or fragmented epiphyses or flattening. The metaphyseal regions of the long bones show flaring, widening or 'trumpeting'. The cervical (89%) and thoracic and lumbar vertebrae show either platyspondyly, ovoid, 'cod-fish' deformity or anterior 'beaking'. Kyphosis (28%), scoliosis (58%) and lumbar lordosis (100%) are commonly seen. The femoral head and acetabulum are severely dysplastic (100%). The knees show either genu valgum (22%), genu varum (56%) or 'windswept' deformity (22%).\nMost commonly these distortions of the appendicular and the axial skeleton lead to premature arthritis particularly of the hips and often the knees not uncommonly in the 20- to 30-year-old age group.\nIII.", "Measures of general cognitive and adaptive ability in adults with Down syndrome (DS) used by previous studies vary substantially. This review summarises the different ability measures used previously, focusing on tests of intelligence quotient (IQ) and adaptive behaviour (AB), and where possible examines floor effects and differences between DS subpopulations. We aimed to use information regarding existing measures to provide recommendations for individual researchers and the DS research community.\nNineteen studies reporting IQ test data met inclusion for this review, with 17 different IQ tests used. Twelve of these IQ tests were used in only one study while five were used in two different studies. Eleven studies reporting AB test data met inclusion for this review, with seven different AB tests used. The only AB scales to be used by more than one study were the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scale (VABS; used by three studies) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 2nd Edition (VABS-II; used by two studies). A variety of additional factors were identified which make comparison of test scores between studies problematic, including different score types provided between studies (e.g. raw scores compared to age-equivalent scores) and different participant inclusion criteria (e.g. whether individuals with cognitive decline were excluded). Floor effects were common for IQ tests (particularly for standardised test scores). Data exists to suggest that floor effects may be minimised by the use of raw test scores rather than standardised test scores. Raw scores may, therefore, be particularly useful in longitudinal studies to track change in cognitive ability over time.\nStudies assessing general ability in adults with DS are likely to benefit from the use of both IQ and AB scales. The DS research community may benefit from the development of reporting standards for IQ and AB data, and from the sharing of raw study data enabling further in-depth investigation of issues highlighted by this review.", "Differences in Conflict-Based Play Behavior, Socio-Emotional and Cognitive Development of Preterm Children Compared to Full-Term Children at Preschool Age Preterm children are at increased risk for socio-emotional and cognitive developmental difficulties at preschool age. This study investigates whether preterm children (n = 50) at the age of five years show different socio-emotional competencies in conflict situations and in the corresponding conflict resolution capacity in comparison to full-term children (n = 50). For this purpose, the MacArthur Story Stem Battery was used as the central examination method. In addition, parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire to obtain information about the children's behavior; moreover, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Third Edition was applied to examine cognitive development. The parental reports did not reveal any behavioral differences between preterm and term children. However, significant group differences regarding their play behavior were detected. In their narratives, preterm children included content themes of interpersonal conflict and dysregulation more frequently compared to term born controls. Concerning empathic and moral themes and narrative coherence, no group difference could be detected. This could indicate that preterm children show no clinically manifest behavioral disorders at preschool age, but differences concerning intrapsychic experience compared to controls. In addition, preterm children had significantly lower IQ scores than term-born controls. Gestational age was a significant predictor of IQ and hyperactivity and attention problems. The results clarify the need for long term clinical follow up of preterm children and should be used to provide more specific care and support.\nZusammenfassung Fr\u00fchgeborene stellen eine Risikogruppe f\u00fcr sozioemotionale und kognitive Entwicklungsauff\u00e4lligkeiten im Vorschulalter dar. In der vorliegenden Studie wird untersucht, ob sich Fr\u00fchgeborene (n = 50) im Alter von f\u00fcnf Jahren in ihrer sozioemotionalen Kompetenz im Spielverhalten in Konfliktsituationen und in der entsprechenden Konfliktl\u00f6sung von Termingeborenen (n = 50) unterscheiden. Zentrales Untersuchungsinstrument hierf\u00fcr ist die MacArthur Story Stem Battery. Ferner wird das kindliche Verhalten mit der Elternversion des Strenghts and Difficulties Questionnaire erfasst und der kognitive Entwicklungsstand anhand der Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence \u2013 Third Edition untersucht. Fr\u00fchgeborene unterschieden sich im Vergleich zu Termingeborenen laut Elterneinsch\u00e4tzung nicht in ihrem beobachtbaren Verhalten, dagegen deutlich hinsichtlich konfliktbasierter Spielnarrative. Bei Fr\u00fchgeborenen waren die Geschichtenerg\u00e4nzungen vermehrt gepr\u00e4gt durch interpersonelle Konfliktthemen sowie Dysregulationsthemen. Keine bedeutsamen Gruppenunterschiede zeigten sich hinsichtlich einf\u00fchlsamer und moralischer Themen sowie der narrativen Koh\u00e4renz. Dies k\u00f6nnte darauf hinweisen, dass Fr\u00fchgeborene im Vorschulalter meist noch keine klinisch manifesten St\u00f6rungen im Verhalten, dennoch aber Unterschiede im innerpsychischen Erleben zeigen. Dar\u00fcber hinaus zeigten Fr\u00fchgeborene signifikant niedrigere kognitive Leistungen als Termingeborene. Das Gestationsalter war ein signifikanter Pr\u00e4diktor f\u00fcr das Abschneiden im Intelligenztest und f\u00fcr Hyperaktivit\u00e4ts- und Aufmerksamkeitsprobleme. Die Ergebnisse verdeutlichen die Notwendigkeit einer langfristigen Fr\u00fchgeborenennachsorge und sollen helfen, diese Risikokinder noch spezifischer betreuen und f\u00f6rdern zu k\u00f6nnen.", "This study examines the relationship between trait emotional intelligence (trait EI), support, and parental psychological control practices. Three hundred adolescents, between 11 and 13\u00a0years old, took part in the study (163 were males and 137 were females). Participants completed the Perceptions of Parents Scales for the parental support, the Dependency (DPC)- and Achievement (APC)-oriented Psychological Control Scales for the parental psychological control, and the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Child Form for the child's trait EI. Trait EI was related to parenting variables, and also, parental practices (both support and psychological control) predicted global trait EI in adolescents. Some gender-specific differences were found: both APC and DPC were negative predictors of trait EI in males, whereas only APC significantly predicted trait EI in females. Future longitudinal studies are needed to examine these results and to shed light on the processes involved in the development of trait EI. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on the subject? There exists strong evidence of the interaction between parenting practices and emotional development in children and adolescents. Therefore, parental psychological control is negatively correlated with peer support and self-esteem, and positively related to anxiety and aggressive behaviour in children. However, there is paucity on research examining the relationship between parenting and trait EI in children. What does this study adds? This study extends earlier work in this field and investigates whether there is a relationship between trait EI and parenting practices (parental support and psychological control) and whether it depends on child and parent gender. This study, therefore, aims to investigate, for the first time, parental factors that may, in addition to those constitutional, be related to trait EI in children. Specifically, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether parenting practices would predict adolescents' trait EI and whether these relations depend on the gender.", "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) facilitates neuronal growth and plasticity, and is crucial for learning and memory. Contactin-1 (CNTN1) is a member of the subfamily of neural immunoglobulin and is involved in the formation of axon connections in the developing nervous system. This cross-sectional study investigates whether BDNF and CNTN1 affect susceptibility to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A total of 136 drug-na\u00efve patients with ADHD (108 boys and 28 girls) and 71 healthy controls (45 boys and 26 girls) were recruited. Blood samples were obtained to measure the plasma levels of BDNF and CNTN1 in each child. We found that BDNF levels in the ADHD boys exceeded those in the control boys, but BDNF levels in the ADHD girls were lower than those in the control girls. Boys who had higher BDNF levels performed worse on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, but girls who had higher BDNF levels made fewer omission errors in the Conners' Continuous Performance Test. However, CNTN1 level did not differ significantly between patients and controls, and were not correlated to ADHD characteristics, regardless of gender. The findings suggest BDNF may influence sex-specific susceptibility to ADHD, but CNTN1 was not associated with ADHD pathophysiology.", "Video capsule endoscopy became a reality in 2001. This device enabled us to directly view the mucosa of the small intestine for the first time. The main indications for the video capsule remain the detection of small intestinal bleeding and iron deficiency anemia, diagnosis and management of Crohn's disease, and detection of tumors. The device is extraordinarily safe and can be used in the very young to the very old. However, there remain several areas of controversy and difficulty. These are covered in this article and include details of indications and contraindications, whether to prepare patients, whether or not to use simethicone and prokinetics. Detection of location of the capsule remains a major engineering challenge. Reading the videos reliably and quickly remains challenging. However, artificial intelligence and machine learning are already on the horizon to provide assistance. New uses for capsule endoscopy promise more accurate diagnosis and hence improved management of acute gastrointestinal bleeding. The colon capsule may eventually help those who refuse conventional colonoscopy, and robotically controlled capsules may be helpful in screening for serious disease in patients with upper abdominal complaints. The advent of the broadening use of video capsule endoscopy is, though it will be controversial, embraced by some and derided by others; such is the nature of technological development. In the long run, if the use of the video capsule, based on sound evidence-based studies, can be shown to improve the care of our patients and reduce the cost of health care, its use will continue to expand.", "Cortical development is characterized by distinct spatial and temporal patterns of maturational changes across various cortical shape measures. There is a growing interest in summarizing complex developmental patterns into a single index, which can be used to characterize an individual's brain age. We conducted this study with two primary aims. First, we sought to quantify covariation patterns for a variety of cortical shape measures, including cortical thickness, gray matter volume, surface area, mean curvature, and travel depth, as well as white matter volume, and subcortical gray matter volume. We examined these measures in a sample of 869 participants aged 5-18 from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) neurodevelopmental cohort using the Joint and Individual Variation Explained (Lock et\u00a0al., 2013) method. We validated our results in an independent dataset from the Nathan Kline Institute - Rockland Sample (NKI-RS; N\u202f=\u202f210) and found remarkable consistency for some covariation patterns. Second, we assessed whether covariation patterns in the brain can be used to accurately predict a person's chronological age. Using ridge regression, we showed that covariation patterns can predict chronological age with high accuracy, reflected by our ability to cross-validate our model in an independent sample with a correlation coefficient of 0.84 between chronologic and predicted age. These covariation patterns also predicted sex with high accuracy (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.85), and explained a substantial portion of variation in full scale intelligence quotient (R2\u202f=\u202f0.10). In summary, we found significant covariation across different cortical shape measures and subcortical gray matter volumes. In addition, each shape measure exhibited distinct covariations that could not be accounted for by other shape measures. These covariation patterns accurately predicted chronological age, sex and general cognitive ability. In a subset of NKI-RS, test-retest (<1 month apart, N\u202f=\u202f120) and longitudinal scans (1.22\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.29 years apart, N\u202f=\u202f77) were available, allowing us to demonstrate high reliability for the prediction models obtained and the ability to detect subtle differences in the longitudinal scan interval among participants (median and median absolute deviation of absolute differences between predicted age difference and real age difference\u202f=\u202f0.53\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.47 years, r\u202f=\u202f0.24, p-value\u202f=\u202f0.04).", "Whether maternal obesity and gestational weight gain (GWG) are associated with early-childhood development in low-income, urban, minority populations, and whether effects differ by child sex remain unknown. This study examined the impact of prepregnancy BMI and GWG on early childhood neurodevelopment in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns study. Maternal prepregnancy weight was obtained by self-report, and GWG was assessed from participant medical charts. At child age 3 years, the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) and Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Intelligence were completed. Sex-stratified linear regression models assessed associations between prepregnancy BMI and pregnancy weight gain z-scores with child PDI and MDI scores, adjusting for covariates. Of 382 women, 48.2% were normal weight before pregnancy, 24.1% overweight, 23.0% obese, and 4.7% underweight. At 3 years, mean scores on the PDI and MDI were higher among girls compared to boys (PDI: 102.3 vs. 97.2, P = 0.0002; MDI: 92.8 vs. 88.3, P = 0.0001). In covariate-adjusted models, maternal obesity was markedly associated with lower PDI scores in boys [b = -7.81, 95% CI: (-13.08, -2.55), P = 0.004], but not girls. Maternal BMI was not associated with MDI in girls or boys, and GWG was not associated with PDI or MDI among either sex (all-P > 0.05). We found that prepregnancy obesity was associated with lower PDI scores at 3 years in boys, but not girls. The mechanisms underlying this sex-specific association remain unclear, but due to elevated obesity exposure in urban populations, further investigation is warranted.", "There is a pressing need to identify markers of cognitive and neural decline in healthy late-midlife participants. We explored the relationship between cross-sectional structural brain-imaging derived phenotypes (IDPs) and cognitive ability, demographic, health and lifestyle factors (non-IDPs). Participants were recruited from the 1953 Danish Male Birth Cohort (N=193). Applying an extreme group design, members were selected in 2 groups based on cognitive change between IQ at age ~20y (IQ-20) and age ~57y (IQ-57). Subjects showing the highest (n=95) and lowest (n=98) change were selected (at age ~57) for assessments on multiple IDPs and non-IDPs. We investigated the relationship between 453 IDPs and 70 non-IDPs through pairwise correlation and multivariate canonical correlation analysis (CCA) models. Significant pairwise associations included positive associations between IQ-20 and gray-matter volume of the temporal pole. CCA identified a richer pattern - a single \"positive-negative\" mode of population co-variation coupling individual cross-subject variations in IDPs to an extensive range of non-IDP measures (r = 0.75, Pcorrected < 0.01). Specifically, this mode linked higher cognitive performance, positive early-life social factors, and mental health to a larger brain volume of several brain structures, overall volume, and microstructural properties of some white matter tracts. Interestingly, both statistical models identified IQ-20 and gray-matter volume of the temporal pole as important contributors to the inter-individual variation observed. The converging patterns provide novel insight into the importance of early adulthood intelligence as a significant marker of late-midlife neural decline and motivates additional study.", "Chalcogenide compounds are the main characters in a revolution in electronic memories. These materials are used to produce ultrafast ovonic threshold switches (OTSs) with good selectivity and moderate leakage current and phase-change memories (PCMs) with excellent endurance and short read/write times when compared with state-of-the-art flash-NANDs. The combination of these two electrical elements is used to fabricate nonvolatile memory arrays with a write/access time orders of magnitude shorter than that of state-of-the-art flash-NANDs. These devices have a pivotal role for the advancement of fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big-data. Chalcogenide films, at the moment, are deposited by using physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques that allow for fine control over the stoichiometry of solid solutions but fail in providing the conformality required for developing large-memory-capacity integrated 3D structures. Here we present conformal ALD chalcogenide films with control over the composition of germanium, antimony, and tellurium (GST). By developing a technique to grow elemental Te we demonstrate the ability to deposit conformal, smooth, composition-controlled GST films. We present a thorough physical and chemical characterization of the solids and an in-depth electrical test. We demonstrate the ability to produce both OTS and PCM materials. GeTe4 OTSs exhibit fast switching times of \u223c13 ns. Ge2Sb2Te5 ALD PCMs exhibit a wide memory window exceeding two orders of magnitude, short write times (\u223c100 ns), and a reset current density as low as \u223c107 A/cm2-performance matching or improving upon state-of-the-art PVD PCM devices.", "Antimycotics are substances to treat fungal infections, a frequent cause of death on intensive care units. It is of great importance to administer such drugs only to patients who actually need them, since the unnecessary application leads to the selection of multiresistent fungi, making future therapy more difficult, and represents a significant financial burden for the health care system. Within the scope of a prospective study, which analyses the premature discontinuation of the administration of unnecessary antifungal drugs, two software platforms for recruitment support were implemented and compared at the University Hospital Erlangen. Besides technical aspects, such as the necessary development time and query runtimes, their usability and user friendliness for the clinical users were compared. We found that the practical identification of patient cohorts is possible both with a full featured business intelligence application and with a low effort approach based on language constructs of the Arden Syntax. Furthermore, this pilot evaluation led to important insights related to the clinical documentation context and data quality issues. A comprehensive analysis of the clinical environment and documentation context is essential for the final decision on the tool to be used.", "In a context described as a challenge in parenting (having an autistic child), we sought to highlight the emotional skills that mothers gain as a result of interacting with their child, and how they then use these skills. Mothers of autistic children (n\u2009=\u2009136) and mothers of non-autistic children (n\u2009=\u2009139) responded to emotional intelligence, resilience, and coping scales. Comparisons revealed smaller differences between groups than expected. Nevertheless, mothers of autistic children showed greater resilience abilities than mothers of non-autistic children. Moreover, we noted differences between both groups regarding their use of emotional skills. Emotional intelligence is a resource that deserves to be explored in terms of its clinical implications, especially among the parents of autistic children.", "Sex and age have long been known to affect the ECG. Several biologic variables and anatomic factors may contribute to sex and age-related differences on the ECG. We hypothesized that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be trained through a process called deep learning to predict a person's age and self-reported sex using only 12-lead ECG signals. We further hypothesized that discrepancies between CNN-predicted age and chronological age may serve as a physiological measure of health.\nWe trained CNNs using 10-second samples of 12-lead ECG signals from 499\u2009727 patients to predict sex and age. The networks were tested on a separate cohort of 275\u2009056 patients. Subsequently, 100 randomly selected patients with multiple ECGs over the course of decades were identified to assess within-individual accuracy of CNN age estimation.\nOf 275\u2009056 patients tested, 52% were males and mean age was 58.6\u00b116.2 years. For sex classification, the model obtained 90.4% classification accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.97 in the independent test data. Age was estimated as a continuous variable with an average error of 6.9\u00b15.6 years (R-squared =0.7). Among 100 patients with multiple ECGs over the course of at least 2 decades of life, most patients (51%) had an average error between real age and CNN-predicted age of <7 years. Major factors seen among patients with a CNN-predicted age that exceeded chronologic age by >7 years included: low ejection fraction, hypertension, and coronary disease (P<0.01). In the 27% of patients where correlation was >0.8 between CNN-predicted and chronologic age, no incident events occurred over follow-up (33\u00b112 years).\nApplying artificial intelligence to the ECG allows prediction of patient sex and estimation of age. The ability of an artificial intelligence algorithm to determine physiological age, with further validation, may serve as a measure of overall health.", "Background Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder resulting in high phenylalanine (Phe) blood concentrations due to the deficiency of the hepatic enzyme Phe hydroxylase. High Phe levels are currently treated with diet, thus avoiding mental retardation, psychomotor delay, etc. The aim of this study was to find out the self-presentation of the disease by the patients. Methods A total number of 110 patients self-represented their disease: food allergy (Phe allergy) n\u2009=\u200934/110 (30.9%), health problems n\u2009=\u200931/110 (28.2%), severe health problems n\u2009=\u200926/110 (23.6%), very severe health problems n\u2009=\u200919/110 (17.3%). The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC III) psychometric test was utilized for the evaluation of IQ scores of each participant. A special questionnaire was used focusing on quality of life (QL), social discrimination (SD) and anxiety or depression (AD). Results IQ scores were found to be higher in food allergy self-represented patients than those of the other tested groups. The lowest IQ scores were observed in those who represented very severe disease. QL, SD and AD were not observed in the food allergy groups. On the contrary, those who self-presented as very severe diseased patients felt high a disturbance of QL, SD and AD. Conclusions The food allergy group seemed to be a very clever excuse for adhering to PKU treatment resulting in high IQ scores and absence of the mentioned upsets. In contrast, in the other groups of patients' IQ scores were found to be lower than that of food allergy group. Damage of QL, SD, AD were also apparent.", "Very long-term outcomes are rarely reported for patients with shunted pediatric hydrocephalus. This study aimed to determine the functional, social, and neurocognitive outcomes of such patients after transition to adulthood.\nAdult patients with pediatric hydrocephalus who underwent their first shunt operation between 1982 and 1992 were included. Functional, social, educational, working aspects, and verbal intelligence were evaluated. In patients with average or above average verbal intelligence, detailed neuropsychological testing was performed and memory, executive functioning, selective attention, and concentration were assessed.\nOverall, 137 patients underwent primary surgery because of pediatric hydrocephalus, 53 (38.7%) of whom died during the follow-up period. Of the 84 long-term survivors, 65 (77.4%) agreed to participate and were included for further analysis. Forty-five patients (69.2%) had completed secondary school, but only 34 (52.3%) were integrated in the open labor market. Although the verbal intelligence of 31 patients (47.7%) was within the normal range, 19 (29.2%) had a severe mental handicap. Shunt infections (P\u00a0= 0.0025), epilepsy (P < 0.0001), and the number of shunt operations (P\u00a0= 0.0082) were associated with reduced verbal intelligence. Most patients with average or above average verbal intelligence had deficits in detailed neuropsychological testing. In 23 patients, detailed neuropsychological testing was performed.\nThe overall long-term outcome of patients with shunted pediatric hydrocephalus is poor. These results highlight the importance of lifelong routine controls to avoid later complications. Further, repeated neuropsychological examinations might be important to understand the patient's special needs to optimize professional support.", "The Current Insights feature is designed to introduce life science educators and researchers to current articles of interest in other social science and education journals. In this installment, I highlight three diverse research studies: one exploring what researchers actually mean when they talk about relevance; one describing the relationships between instructor mindset about intelligence and performance gaps in the classroom; and the last describing a novel short intervention to reduce student's perceptions of costs.", "Neuronal activity can be modeled as a nonlinear dynamical system to yield measures of neuronal state and dysfunction. The electrical recordings of stem cell-derived neurons from individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and controls were analyzed using minimum embedding dimension (MED) analysis to characterize their dynamical complexity. MED analysis revealed a significant reduction in dynamical complexity in ASD neurons during differentiation, which was correlated to bursting and spike interval measures. MED was associated with clinical endpoints, such as nonverbal intelligence, and was correlated with 53 differentially expressed genes, which were overrepresented with ASD risk genes related to neurodevelopment, cell morphology, and cell migration. Spatiotemporal analysis also showed a prenatal temporal enrichment in cortical and deep brain structures. Together, we present dynamical analysis as a paradigm that can be used to distinguish disease-associated cellular electrophysiological and transcriptional signatures, while taking into account patient variability in neuropsychiatric disorders.", "Early exposure to inflammation in childhood is increasingly recognized as one of the major factors that hinder millions of children worldwide from meeting their full developmental potential. The current study examined the association between systemic inflammation and children's neural responses to facial stimuli and explored if this activity mediated the relation between inflammation and cognitive outcomes.\nTwo separate cohorts of children living in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh who are at high-risk for sustained inflammation were recruited in this study. The concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood samples served as our index of inflammation. Blood samples were collected once at 18 weeks for the younger (infant) cohort (N\u202f=\u202f125) and at 6, 18, 40, 53, and 104 weeks for the older (toddler) cohort (N\u202f=\u202f120). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were also recorded separately for the two cohorts: at 6 months for the younger cohort (N\u202f=\u202f48) and at 36 months for the older cohort (N\u202f=\u202f93), using a face-oddball paradigm in which standard and oddball faces were presented. Cognitive outcomes were evaluated with Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) at 27 months for the younger cohort (N\u202f=\u202f98) and with Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) at 48 months for the older cohort (N\u202f=\u202f124).\nFor the older toddler cohort, the P400 and Nc amplitude differences between the two types of stimuli were found to be associated with the frequency of elevated CRP such that more episodes of elevated CRP corresponded to smaller P400 and Nc differences between the two conditions. In addition, the P400 and Nc differences were both found to mediate the relation between inflammation and performance IQ scores. For the younger infant cohort, the participants showed differentiated N290 response to the two types of stimuli, but no association between the ERP response and CRP concentration was found.\nThese findings suggest that chronic systemic inflammation has a long-term impact on children's brain functioning and cognitive development. The neural circuitries associated with social attention and recognition memory of faces may be potential pathways by which inflammation exerts its effect on cognitive development.", "We undertook a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence-based software for identification of radiologic abnormalities (computer-aided detection, or CAD) compatible with pulmonary tuberculosis on chest x-rays (CXRs). We searched four databases for articles published between January 2005-February 2019. We summarized data on CAD type, study design, and diagnostic accuracy. We assessed risk of bias with QUADAS-2. We included 53 of the 4712 articles reviewed: 40 focused on CAD design methods (\"Development\" studies) and 13 focused on evaluation of CAD (\"Clinical\" studies). Meta-analyses were not performed due to methodological differences. Development studies were more likely to use CXR databases with greater potential for bias as compared to Clinical studies. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (median AUC [IQR]) were significantly higher: in Development studies AUC: 0.88 [0.82-0.90]) versus Clinical studies (0.75 [0.66-0.87]; p-value 0.004); and with deep-learning (0.91 [0.88-0.99]) versus machine-learning (0.82 [0.75-0.89]; p = 0.001). We conclude that CAD programs are promising, but the majority of work thus far has been on development rather than clinical evaluation. We provide concrete suggestions on what study design elements should be improved.", "The application of big data to the quality assurance of radiation therapy is multifaceted. Big data can be used to detect anomalies and suboptimal quality metrics through both statistical means and more advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence. The application of these methods to clinical practice is discussed through examples of guideline adherence, contour integrity, treatment delivery mechanics, and treatment plan quality. The ultimate goal is to apply big data methods to direct measures of patient outcomes for care quality. The era of big data and machine learning is maturing and the implementation for quality assurance promises to improve the quality of care for patients.", "This article discusses the role of several constructs, such as workplace relational civility (WRC), positive relational management (PRM), and emotional intelligence (EI), as possible primary preventive resources to effectively deal with interpersonal mistreatment in the workplace (i.e., incivility). Since women endure workplace incivility more frequently than men, their well-being is particularly at risk. Thus, the possibilities for further research and primary prevention interventions in line with the achievement of the fifth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 5) are discussed.", "To develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model based on texture analysis of high-resolution T2 weighted MR images able 1) to predict pathologic Complete Response (CR) and 2) to identify non-responders (NR) among patients with locally-advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT).\nFifty-five consecutive patients with LARC were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Patients underwent 3\u2009T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquiring T2-weighted images before, during and after CRT. All patients underwent complete surgical resection and histopathology was the gold standard. Textural features were automatically extracted using an open-source software. A sub-set of statistically significant textural features was selected and two AI models were built by training a Random Forest (RF) classifier on 28 patients (training cohort). Model performances were estimated on 27 patients (validation cohort) using a ROC curve and a decision curve analysis.\nSixteen of 55 patients achieved CR. The AI model for CR classification showed good discrimination power with mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.94) in the validation cohort. The discriminatory power for the NR classification showed a mean AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.71,0.92). Decision curve analysis confirmed higher net patient benefit when using AI models compared to standard-of-care.\nAI models based on textural features of MR images of patients with LARC may help to identify patients who will show CR at the end of treatment and those who will not respond to therapy (NR) at an early stage of the treatment.", "Electromagnetic Vibration Energy Harvesting (EM-VEH) is an attractive alternative to batteries as a power source for wireless sensor nodes that enable intelligence at the edge of the Internet of Things (IoT). Industrial environments in particular offer an abundance of available kinetic energy, in the form of machinery vibrations that can be converted into electrical power through energy harvesting techniques. These ambient vibrations are generally broadband, and multi-modal harvesting configurations can be exploited to improve the mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion. However, the additional challenge of energy conditioning (AC-to-DC conversion) to make the harvested energy useful brings into question what specific type of performance is to be expected in a real industrial application. This paper reports the operation of two practical IoT sensor nodes, continuously powered by the vibrations of a standard industrial compressor, using a multi-modal EM-VEH device, integrated with customised power management. The results show that the device and the power management circuit provide sufficient energy to receive and transmit data at intervals of less than one minute with an overall efficiency of about 30%. Descriptions of the system, test-bench, and the measured outcomes are presented.", "This paper presents an artificial intelligence-based ultrasound simulator suitable for medical simulation and clinical training. Particularly, we propose a machine learning approach to realistically simulate ultrasound images based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Using B-mode ultrasound images simulated by a known ultrasound simulator, Field II, an \"image-to-image\" ultrasound simulator was trained. Then, through evaluations, we found that the GAN-based simulator can generate B-mode images following Rayleigh scattering. Our preliminary study demonstrated that ultrasound B-mode images from anatomies inferred from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were feasible. While some image blurring was observed, ultrasound B- mode images obtained were both visually and quantitatively comparable to those obtained using the Field II simulator. It is also important to note that the GAN-based ultrasound simulator was computationally efficient and could achieve a frame rate of 15 frames/second using a regular laptop computer. In the future, the proposed GAN-based simulator will be used to synthesize more realistic looking ultrasound images with artifacts such as shadowing.", "The main objective of the present research is to analyze the relationship of levels of self-efficacy and anxiety, coping strategies, and emotional intelligence in Spanish university students. This study has a cross-sectional design. The sample was composed of 258 university students recruited from three academic areas. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate regression analyses were performed. Significant bivariate analysis showed a significant inverse correlation between self-efficacy and state anxiety (r = -0.340) and trait anxiety (r = -0.466). In addition, a direct correlation was found between self-efficacy and the coping strategies of problem-solving (r = 0.312), emotional expression (r = 0.133), cognitive restructuring (r = 0.195), social withdrawal (r = 0.103), and coping with a situation (r = 0.303), as well as with the emotional intelligence dimensions of emotional clarity (r = 0.397) and repair mood (r = 0.347). Multivariate regression analysis showed that trait anxiety, problem-solving, emotional expression, social withdrawal, and emotional clarity were significantly related to the dependent variable, predicting 39% of total variance on levels of general perceived self-efficacy. In conclusion, this paper contributes to a better understanding of the related factors to general perceived self-efficacy in undergraduate students.", "Introduction: It is widely accepted that major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with impairments in several cognitive domains in inpatients, but cognitive functioning has barely been systematically investigated in depressed outpatients. The aims of the present study were to examine cognitive functioning in depressed outpatients in comparison with healthy controls and to determine whether cognitive deficits vary as a function of different disorder characteristics and demographic variables. Method: We compared 103 outpatients with recurrent MDD in an acute phase of the illness with 103 healthy controls matched on age, gender, and education level using a neuropsychological battery covering the domains of processing speed, attention, memory, working memory, and executive functions. Results: Depressed outpatients were found to be impaired in all five assessed cognitive domains. These impairments varied as a function of the disorder characteristics, particularly severity of depression, intake of medication, age of depression onset, duration of current episode, and rumination as a psychological variable as well as age, premorbid intelligence, and education level as demographic variables. Conclusions: In the present study we tried to systematically investigate the impact of different disorder characteristics and demographic variables on the cognitive dysfunction of outpatients with MDD. The results indicate a moderate to severe cognitive impairment of outpatients with MDD and reveal an influence of different disease characteristics as well as demographics. These cognitive impairments may affect the course of the disease and should be considered in outpatient therapy.", "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) accounts for \u223c10% of dementia cases and is the most common cause of early-onset dementia. However, no well-validated instrument currently exists to measure knowledge about FTD. In this study, we used systematic scale development procedures to create a scale to measure knowledge of FTD based on a contemporary understanding of the disease.\nStandard scale development methods were used to create items and evaluate their psychometric properties. A total of 72 health care professionals and 102 caregivers of people with FTD responded to items measuring FTD knowledge, general dementia knowledge, crystallized intelligence, experience with FTD, and demographic information.\nThe Frontotemporal Dementia Knowledge Scale (FTDKS) contains 18 items that cover key, basic knowledge about FTD in the domains of risk factors, symptoms, course, caregiving, and treatment. The scale uses a 4-point True/False format with a Don't Know option and takes \u223c5 minutes to complete. In the current sample the FTDKS had good psychometric properties in terms of reliability and validity.\nThe FTDKS can be used with health care professionals and caregivers of people with FTD to assess their knowledge about the disease. The scale may be useful to evaluate knowledge in clinical care and educational program contexts.", "Whether severe obstetric complications (OCs), which harm neural function in offspring, contribute to impaired cognition found in psychiatric disorders is currently unknown. Here, we sought to evaluate how a history of severe OCs is associated with cognitive functioning, indicated by Intelligence Quotient (IQ).\nWe evaluated the associations of a history of OCs and IQ in 622 healthy controls (HC) and 870 patients on the schizophrenia (SCZ) - bipolar disorder (BIP) spectrum from the ongoing Thematically Organized Psychosis study cohort, Oslo, Norway. Participants underwent assessments using the NART (premorbid IQ) and the WASI (current IQ). Information about OCs was obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Multiple linear regression models were used for analysis.\nSevere OCs were equally common across groups. SCZ patients with OCs had lower performances on both premorbid and current IQ measures, compared to those without OCs. However, having experienced more than one co-occurring severe OC was associated with lower current IQ in all groups.\nSevere OCs were associated with lower IQ in the SCZ group and in the BIP and HC groups, but only if they had experienced more than one severe OC. Low IQ might be a neurodevelopmental marker for SCZ; wherein, severe OCs influence cognitive abilities and increase the risk of developing SCZ. Considering OCs as a variable of neurodevelopmental risk for severe mental illness may promote the development of neuroprotective interventions, improve outcome in vulnerable newborns and advance our ability to make clinical prognoses.", "Living organisms process information to interact and adapt to their surroundings with the goal of finding food, mating, or averting hazards. The structure of their environment has profound repercussions through both selecting their internal architecture and also inducing adaptive responses to environmental cues and stimuli. Adaptive collective behavior underpinned by specialized optimization strategies is ubiquitous in the natural world. We develop a minimal model of agents that explore their environment by means of sampling trajectories. The spatial information stored in the sampling trajectories is our minimal definition of a cognitive map. We find that, as cognitive agents build and update their internal, cognitive representation of the causal structure of their environment, complex patterns emerge in the system, where the onset of pattern formation relates to the spatial overlap of cognitive maps. Exchange of information among the agents leads to an order-disorder transition. As a result of the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry, a Goldstone mode emerges, which points at a collective mechanism of information transfer among cognitive organisms. These findings may be generally applicable to the design of decentralized, artificial-intelligence swarm systems.", "Forensic DNA phenotyping (FDP) technology represents a set of techniques that aim to predict physical features of criminal suspects, such as eye, skin and hair colour, and also ethnicity through the inference of biogeographic ancestry from their biological samples. In contrast to other forensic technologies, FDP is not used for identification purposes but valued for its potential intelligence value. Since features predicted by FDP relate to common traits shared by different population groups, critical voices highlight that this technology may (re)create dynamics of collectivisation of suspect populations. Looking at the criminal justice system, this paper aims to explore the diverse understandings of FDP by professionals working in forensic laboratories and by the members of police forces, alongside the automatic exchange of genetic profiles to fight cross-border crime. Their perceptions are explored according to the perceived potential investigative value and potential threats of FDP. Furthermore, we discuss how racial issues are implicitly and explicitly present in these narratives. Results show that FDP may be ushering in a new assemblage of racial issues along three entangled dimensions: the differentiating power of externally visible characteristics, the comparison between genetic and eyewitness testimonies, and the collectivisation of suspicion.", "This article explores secondary traumatic stress (STS) and the emotional challenges that emergency nurses face when dealing with traumatised patients. The few studies on STS have shown a higher occurrence of STS symptoms in emergency nurses but provide limited evidence on how personal experiences may contribute to STS. Risk factors identified include repeated exposure to trauma; morbidity and mortality; personal trauma; chronic stressors; workload and emergency department pressures. STS can lead to reduced job satisfaction, sick leave and burnout. Protective factors include awareness and self-care, emotional intelligence, social support and education about STS. Strategies to minimise STS include balancing personal and professional life and the support of employers to help reduce compassion fatigue and aid staff retention.", "Background: Emotional intelligence defined as the ability to recognise and respond appropriately to emotions in oneself and others is valued within nursing and midwifery professions.Objective: To explore nursing and midwifery students' understanding and experiences of emotional intelligence in their undergraduate program.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with undergraduate nursing and midwifery students. Data were recorded, transcribed and underwent thematic analysis.Findings: Three themes emerged from the interviews with seven participants: Emotional intelligence and undergraduate studies, Emotionally needed to be invested; Emotional intelligence and the clinical environment, I don't want to like harden up; and Emotional intelligence and patient care, I just felt helpless.Conclusion: The impact of emotions and subsequent behaviours on students' theoretical learning and clinical practice was significant. Students' often felt ill-prepared to portray emotional intelligence, particularly within the clinical environment.Impact statement: This study provided valuable insights into nursing and midwifery students' understanding and experiences of emotional intelligence.", "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches in combination with Raman spectroscopy (RS) to obtain accurate medical diagnosis and decision-making is a way forward for understanding not only the chemical pathway to the progression of disease, but also for tailor-made personalized medicine. These processes remove unwanted affects in the spectra such as noise, fluorescence and normalization, and help in the optimization of spectral data by employing chemometrics. Methods: In this study, breast cancer tissues have been analyzed by RS in conjunction with principal component (PCA) and linear discriminate (LDA) analyses. Tissue microarray (TMA) breast biopsies were investigated using RS and chemometric methods and classified breast biopsies into luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and triple negative subtypes. Results: Supervised and unsupervised algorithms were applied on biopsy data to explore intra and inter data set biochemical changes associated with lipids, collagen, and nucleic acid content. LDA predicted specificity accuracy of luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and triple negative subtypes were 70%, 100%, 90%, and 96.7%, respectively. Conclusion: It is envisaged that a combination of RS with AI and ML may create a precise and accurate real-time methodology for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.", "The aim of the present study was to validate a new procedure, called EMOCINE test, to measure the perception and understanding branches of emotional intelligence (EI) in 1,448 children, aged between 8 and 13 years, from elementary schools. This new tool consists of watching 15 cartoon film clips and interpreting them according to children's own emotional perception and comprehension. After completing the test, the participants were classifie, according to their responses and by using the latent class analysis, as na\u00efve (16.1%), over-interpretative (33.5%), and sensitive (50.4%). An increase in sensitive responses was observed depending on participants sex (girls higher than boys), and academic grade (increasing over the grades). Participants from the sensitive latent class had a significant better behavior in the school/classroom, compared with those from na\u00efve and over-interpretative groups. Likewise, significant differences between latent classes were observed in many psychological, emotional, and behavioral problems (mainly between sensitive vs. insensitive by naivety) such as: depression, post-traumatic symptomatology, attention problems, aggression, family problems, problems at school, problems with classmates, integration and social competence. In conclusion, EMOCINE is a novel and promising tool for the measurement of the perception and comprehension components of EI. The test, employing film clips, is more realistic and motivating than others using static images or written descriptions. Moreover, the test can predict or identify emotional and behavior problems in children.", "Reducing radiation exposure to the temporal lobes could be beneficial to preserve cognitive function in paediatric brain tumour patients. The distribution of doses to brain substructures associated with cognition (BSCs) both within and outside of the temporal lobe have not been reported. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate temporal lobe sparing photon vs. proton therapy for paediatric suprasellar tumours.\nData from ten anonymized craniopharyngioma patients were used in this study. Temporal lobe sparing volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy plans were optimized to maintain consistent target metrics as in the delivered double scattering proton therapy (DSPT) plans. Thirty BSCs were delineated, including temporal lobe substructures (i.e. amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex). The dose/volume fractions to each BSC were analysed, and intelligence quotient (IQ) as well as memory scores were estimated to compare the different modalities.\nThe exposed volumes of the temporal lobes and their substructures were consistently reduced with PBS compared to DSPT and VMAT, e.g. the left hippocampus V10Gy from 100% (VMAT) or 41% (DSPT) to 5% with PBS (p\u202f=\u202f0.002). Some of the ventricular substructures were better spared with VMAT compared to both proton modalities. The reduced doses to the temporal lobes achieved with PBS translated into improved predicted memory outcomes, but not for the estimated IQ.\nThe irradiated volumes of temporal lobe BSCs were consistently the lowest with PBS, whereas the model-based estimates of cognitive outcomes were less consistent.", "Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated novel discoveries across multiple disciplines including medicine. Clinical medicine suffers from a lack of AI-based applications, potentially due to lack of awareness of AI methodology. Future collaboration between computer scientists and clinicians is critical to maximize the benefits of transformative technology in this field for patients. To illustrate, we describe AI-based advances in the diagnosis and management of gliomas, the most common primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy. Methods: Presented is a succinct description of foundational concepts of AI approaches and their relevance to clinical medicine, geared toward clinicians without computer science backgrounds. We also review novel AI approaches in the diagnosis and management of glioma. Results: Novel AI approaches in gliomas have been developed to predict the grading and genomics from imaging, automate the diagnosis from histopathology, and provide insight into prognosis. Conclusion: Novel AI approaches offer acceptable performance in gliomas. Further investigation is necessary to improve the methodology and determine the full clinical utility of these novel approaches.", "Modern medicine is becoming digital medicine. This is accompanied by a fundamental change in medicine and its professions and an altered relationship between the actors in the healthcare system. In particular, patients become the vital center again. Technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) play a\u00a0crucial role that, however, from a normative perspective has to be questioned critically but benevolently, then every tool can be implemented for false purposes.\nPhilosophical reflections based on the ethical theoretical framework of Vittorio H\u00f6sle and own preparative work, thereby, in particular processing of the reflection dimensions of ethics in digital medicine.\nEthics is necessary as the various initiatives on the macrolevel, mesolevel and microlevel are important as a\u00a0first step but it has to go much further. The microlevel will ultimately become the game changer, patients will not want to relinquish health benefits in the long term and physicians and nursing personnel will not want to relinquish attractive working conditions.\nEthics is a\u00a0demanding enterprise but necessary, especially in a highly complex and future-oriented field, such as digital medicine. Here it is utterly important to choose the third way between innovation xenophobia and over the top healing expectations (supertools), focusing on real personas with real responsibilities. The sustainable education if not enlightenment of patients and professional players is the key.", "With the increase in the world's aging population, there is a growing need to prevent and predict dementia among the general population. The availability of national time-series health examination data in South Korea provides an opportunity to use deep learning algorithm, an artificial intelligence technology, to expedite the analysis of mass and sequential data.\nThis study aimed to compare the discriminative accuracy between a time-series deep learning algorithm and conventional statistical methods to predict all-cause dementia and Alzheimer dementia using periodic health examination data.\nDiagnostic codes in medical claims data from a South Korean national health examination cohort were used to identify individuals who developed dementia or Alzheimer dementia over a 10-year period. As a result, 479,845 and 465,081 individuals, who were aged 40 to 79 years and without all-cause dementia and Alzheimer dementia, respectively, were identified at baseline. The performance of the following 3 models was compared with predictions of which individuals would develop either type of dementia: Cox proportional hazards model using only baseline data (HR-B), Cox proportional hazards model using repeated measurements (HR-R), and deep learning model using repeated measurements (DL-R).\nThe discrimination indices (95% CI) for the HR-B, HR-R, and DL-R models to predict all-cause dementia were 0.84 (0.83-0.85), 0.87 (0.86-0.88), and 0.90 (0.90-0.90), respectively, and those to predict Alzheimer dementia were 0.87 (0.86-0.88), 0.90 (0.88-0.91), and 0.91 (0.91-0.91), respectively. The DL-R model showed the best performance, followed by the HR-R model, in predicting both types of dementia. The DL-R model was superior to the HR-R model in all validation groups tested.\nA deep learning algorithm using time-series data can be an accurate and cost-effective method to predict dementia. A combination of deep learning and proportional hazards models might help to enhance prevention strategies for dementia.", "To establish an effect of alcohol dependence on the cognitive functions of patients with schizophrenia.\nOne hundred patients with paranoid schizophrenia were examined. Half of them had a co-occurring diagnosis of alcohol dependence syndrome. Memory, attention, thinking were studied. Comparisons were made between groups, depending on the presence of the addictive disorder.\nAttention and short-term memory are at the low border of normal values in both groups. No significant between-group differences were found. In Benton test, errors characteristic of schizophrenia were more frequent in the main group. 'Organic' errors were prevalent in the control group. Mild thinking disorders of organic type were significantly more frequent in the main group.\nCo-occurring alcohol dependence does not significantly influence intelligence but significant organic stigmas contribute to the structure of the cognitive profile of patients. The prevalence of organic disturbances in the structure of thinking in patients with co-occurring alcohol abuse was revealed. The best indicators of attention were demonstrated by patients with attack-like schizophrenia without substance abuse. This suggests that the influence of the alcohol factor differs in continuous and attack-like progressive schizophrenia.\n\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c

nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC).\nThis project was launched in 2015 and carried out by the cooperation of an academic cancer centre and a technology company. Patients diagnosed with NPC at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Centre since January 2008 were included in the platform. Standard data elements were established to defined 981 variables for the platform. For each patient, data from 13 EHRs systems were extracted, integrated, structurized and normalized. Eight functional modules were constructed for the platform to facilitate the investigators to identify eligible patients, establish research projects, conduct statistical analysis, track the follow-up, search literature, etc.\nFrom January 2008 to December 2018, 54,703 patients diagnosed with NPC were included. Of these patients, 39,058 (71.4%) were male, and 15,645 (28.6%) were female; median age was 47 (interquartile range, 39-55) years. Of 981 variables, 341 were obtained from data structurization and normalization, of which 68 were generated by interacting multiple data sources via well-defined logical rules. The average precision rate, recall rate and F-measure for 341 variables were 0.97 \u00b1 0.024, 0.92 \u00b1 0.030, and 0.94 \u00b1 0.027 respectively. The platform is regularly updated every seven days to include new patients and add new data for existing patients. Up to now, eight big data-driven retrospective studies have been published from the platform.\nOur big data intelligence platform demonstrates the feasibility of integrating EHRs data of routine healthcare, and offers an important perspective on real-world study of NPC. The continued efforts may be focus on data sharing among multiple hospitals and publicly releasing of data files.\nOur big data intelligence platform is the first disease-specific data platform for NPC research. It incorporates comprehensive EHRs data from routine healthcare, which can facilitate real-world study of NPC in risk stratification, decision-making and comorbidities management.", "Acute and adverse effects of ketamine on cognitive functioning have been documented. No longitudinal study has examined whether cognitive deficits can be reversed following ketamine abstinence although it has been suggested in some cross-sectional studies. This study aimed to investigate the changes in cognitive functioning among ketamine users following a 12-week abstinence from ketamine.\nIn this longitudinal study, 114 ketamine users completed clinical and cognitive assessments at both baseline and 12-week follow-up with the following instruments: Severity of Dependence Scale, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Anxiety Subscale of the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADSA), and a cognitive battery.\nBDI (p < 0.001) and HADSA (p\u202f=\u202f0.044) scores were significantly reduced at the 12-week follow-up. Significant improvements were found in Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Third edition) immediate recall (p < 0.001) and delayed recall (p < 0.001) on the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and in delayed recall (p < 0.001), and immediate recall (p\u202f=\u202f0.001) on the Logical Memory component of the Wechsler Memory Scale (Third Edition) at the 12-week follow-up. Participants completed the Stroop Inference Test significantly faster (p < 0.001); and required fewer number of attempts (p < 0.001) and produced fewer perseverative errors (p < 0.001) on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test at the 12-week follow-up.\nChronic ketamine users' verbal and visual memory and executive functions improved after 12 weeks of ketamine abstinence.", "The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and to explore the feasibility of applying AI-based technique to community hospital for DR screening.\nNonmydriatic fundus photos were taken for 889 diabetic patients who were screened in community hospital clinic. According to DR international classification standards, ophthalmologists and AI identified and classified these fundus photos. The sensitivity and specificity of AI automatic grading were evaluated according to ophthalmologists' grading.\nDR was detected by ophthalmologists in 143 (16.1%) participants and by AI in 145 (16.3%) participants. Among them, there were 101 (11.4%) participants diagnosed with referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR) by ophthalmologists and 103 (11.6%) by AI. The sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of AI for detecting DR were 90.79% (95% CI 86.4-94.1), 98.5% (95% CI 97.8-99.0) and 0.946 (95% CI 0.935-0.956), respectively. For detecting RDR, the sensitivity, specificity and AUC of AI were 91.18% (95% CI 86.4-94.7), 98.79% (95% CI 98.1-99.3) and 0.950 (95% CI 0.939-0.960), respectively.\nAI has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting DR and RDR, so it is feasible to carry out AI-based DR screening in outpatient clinic of community hospital.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants' willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots.\nThe study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor.\nThree broad themes: 'Understanding of chatbots', 'AI hesitancy' and 'Motivations for health chatbots' were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR\u2009=\u20090.32 [CI95%:0.13-0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR\u2009=\u20090.77 [CI95%:0.60-0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR\u2009=\u20095.10 [CI95%:3.08-8.43], positive attitude OR\u2009=\u20092.71 [CI95%:1.77-4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR\u2009=\u20091.92 [CI95%:1.13-3.25].\nMost internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients' concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients' perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots.", "The field of otology is increasingly at the forefront of innovation in science and medicine. The inner ear, one of the most challenging systems to study, has been rendered much more open to inquiry by recent developments in research methodology. Promising advances of potential clinical impact have occurred in recent years in biological fields such as auditory genetics, ototoxic chemoprevention and organ of Corti regeneration. The interface of the ear with digital technology to remediate hearing loss, or as a consumer device within an intelligent ecosystem of connected devices, is receiving enormous creative energy. Automation and artificial intelligence can enhance otological medical and surgical practice. Otology is poised to enter a new renaissance period, in which many previously untreatable ear diseases will yield to newly introduced therapies.\nThis paper speculates on the direction otology will take in the coming decades.\nMaking predictions about the future of otology is a risky endeavour. If the predictions are found wanting, it will likely be because of unforeseen revolutionary methods.", "The development of highly sensitive wearable and foldable pressure sensors is one of the central topics in artificial intelligence, human motion monitoring, and health care monitors. However, current pressure sensors with high sensitivity and good durability in low, medium, and high applied strains are rather limited. Herein, a flexible pressure sensor based on hierarchical three-dimensional and porous reduced graphene oxide (rGO) fiber fabrics as the key sensing element is presented. The internal conductive structural network is formed by the rGO fibers which are mutually contacted by interfused or noninterfused fiber-to-fiber interfaces. Thanks to the unique structures, the sensor can show an excellent sensitivity from low to high applied strains (0.24-70.0%), a high gauge factor (1668.48) at an applied compression of 66.0%, a good durability in a wide range of frequencies, a low detection limit (1.17 Pa), and anultrafast response time (30 ms). The dominated mechanism is that under compression, the slide of the graphene fibers through the polydimethylsiloxane matrix reduces the connection points between the fibers, causing a surge in electrical resistance. In addition, because graphene fibers are porous and defective, the change in geometry of the fibers also causes a change in the electrical resistance of the composite under compression. Furthermore, the interfused fiber-to-fiber interfaces can strengthen the mechanical stability under 0.01-1.0 Hz loadings and high applied strains, and the wrinkles on the surface of the rGO fibers increased the sensitivity under tiny loadings. In addition, the noninterfused fiber-to-fiber interfaces can produce a highly sensitive contact resistance, leading to a higher sensitivity at low applied strains.", "Artificial intelligence and other data-intensive applications have escalated the demand for data storage and processing. New computing devices, such as phase-change random access memory (PCRAM)-based neuro-inspired devices, are promising options for breaking the von Neumann barrier by unifying storage with computing in memory cells. However, current PCRAM devices have considerable noise and drift in electrical resistance that erodes the precision and consistency of these devices. We designed a phase-change heterostructure (PCH) that consists of alternately stacked phase-change and confinement nanolayers to suppress the noise and drift, allowing reliable iterative RESET and cumulative SET operations for high-performance neuro-inspired computing. Our PCH architecture is amenable to industrial production as an intrinsic materials solution, without complex manufacturing procedure or much increased fabrication cost.", "The aim of this study was to determine whether a new nutrition protocol designed to increase early protein intakes while reducing fluid volume in infants born very preterm was associated with altered neurodevelopment and growth in childhood.\nA retrospective, observational cohort study of children born <30 weeks' gestation or <1500\u200ag and admitted to the neonatal unit, National Women's Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand, before and after a change in nutrition protocol. The primary outcome was neurodevelopmental impairment at 7 years (any of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children full scale IQ < 85, Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 total score \u22645th centile, cerebral palsy, blind, or deaf requiring aids). Outcomes were compared between groups and for the overall cohort using generalized linear regression, adjusted for sex and birth weight z score.\nOf 201 eligible children, 128 (64%) were assessed (55/89 [62%] exposed to the old nutrition protocol, 73 of 112 [65%] to the new protocol). Children who experienced the new protocol received more protein, less energy, and less carbohydrate in postnatal days 1 to 7. Neurodevelopmental impairment was similar at 7 years (30/73 [41%] vs 25/55 [45%], adjusted odds ratio [AOR] [95% confidence interval] 0.78 [0.35-1.70], P\u200a=\u200a0.55), as was the incidence of cerebral palsy (AOR 7.36 [0.88-61.40], P\u200a=\u200a0.07). Growth and body composition were also similar between groups. An extra 1\u200ag/kg parenteral protein intake in postnatal days 1 to 7 was associated with a 27% increased odds of cerebral palsy (AOR 1.27 [1.03-1.57], P\u200a=\u200a0.006).\nHigher early protein intakes do not change overall rates of neurodevelopmental impairment or growth at 7 years. Further research is needed to determine the effects of higher early parenteral protein intake on motor development.", "Digital data are anticipated to transform medicine. However, most of today's medical data lack interoperability: hidden in isolated databases, incompatible systems and proprietary software, the data are difficult to exchange, analyze, and interpret. This slows down medical progress, as technologies that rely on these data - artificial intelligence, big data or mobile applications - cannot be used to their full potential. In this article, we argue that interoperability is a prerequisite for the digital innovations envisioned for future medicine. We focus on four areas where interoperable data and IT systems are particularly important: (1) artificial intelligence and big data; (2) medical communication; (3) research; and (4) international cooperation. We discuss how interoperability can facilitate digital transformation in these areas to improve the health and well-being of patients worldwide.", "The aim of the present study was to specify if cerebellar lesions cause memory impairment in children. The study sample consisted of 44 children with low-grade cerebellar astrocytoma, who underwent surgical treatment and 30 healthy controls, matched with regard to age and sex. Memory was tested using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test AVLT, Corsi Block-Tapping Test, Digit Span, Digit Backwards and Information Subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised WISC-R (PL). Patients with cerebellar lesions demonstrated memory impairments, similar to those typical for patients with frontal lesions, with auditory and visuospatial working memory deficits, a disorganized learning process without mnemonic strategy (executive dysfunctions) and problems with recalling new material from long-term memory storage, while maintaining good recognition of previously learned material, preserved semantic knowledge and short-term auditory-verbal memory (digit span). Obtained results showed that memory deficits would vary according to the side of the cerebellar lesion, with more pronounced impairment of visuospatial memory tasks accompanying the left-sided cerebellar lesions and worse performance of verbal memory task, observed in the group of patients with right-sided cerebellar lesions. Although the presence of hydrocephalus significantly worsens the memory performance of the children studied, patients with cerebellar lesions without hydrocephalus still present significantly lower memory indicators in the profile described, compared to the control group of healthy children. It confirms the hypothesis that cerebellar lesion alone could result in memory dysfunctions in children.", "Human fluid intelligence emerges from the interactions of various cognitive processes. Although some classic models characterize intelligence as a unitary \"general ability,\" many distinct lines of research have suggested that it is possible to at least partially decompose intelligence into a set of subsidiary cognitive functions. Much of this work has focused on the relationship between intelligence and working memory, and more specifically between intelligence and the capacity-loading aspects of working memory. These theories focus on domain-general processing capacity limitations, rather than limitations specifically linked to working memory tasks. Performance on other capacity-constrained tasks, even those that have typically been given the label of \"attention tasks,\" may thus also be related to fluid intelligence. We tested a wide range of attention and working memory tasks in 7- to 9-year-old children and adults, and we used the results of these cognitive measures to predict intelligence scores. In a set of 13 measures we did not observe a single \"positive manifold\" that would indicate a general-ability understanding of intelligence. Instead, we found that a small number of measures were related to intelligence scores. More specifically, we found two tasks that are typically labeled as \"attentional measures\", Multiple Object Tracking and Enumeration, and two tasks that are typically labeled as \"working memory\" measures, N-back and Spatial Span, were reliably related to intelligence. However, the links between attention and intelligence scores were fully mediated by working memory measures. In contrast, attention scores did not mediate the relations between working memory and intelligence. Furthermore, these patterns were indistinguishable across age groups, indicating a hierarchical cognitive basis of intelligence that is stable from childhood into adulthood.", "Using current diagnostic tools for hand eczema, namely clinical picture and histology, differential diagnoses such as psoriasis palmaris usually cannot be ruled out.\nDiscussion of current diagnostic possibilities for hand eczema; presentation and critical evaluation of proposed biomarkers for molecular diagnostics and outlook how diagnostics in dermatology will change in the near future.\nIn this article, we discuss basic research and provide a review of the literature.\nMolecular diagnostics has the potential to substantially improve diagnosis of hand eczema; prerequisites are prospective validation of proposed markers and availability of valid and cost-effective diagnostics.\nIn the near future, the diagnosis of hand eczema will be complemented by software algorithms and artificial intelligence on the one hand and simple, precise, and economic molecular diagnostic devices on the other.", "In the long history of identifying factors to predict academic performance, conscientiousness, a so-called 'big five' personality trait describing self-regulation and goal-directed behavior, has emerged as a stable predictor for this purpose. However, the neuroanatomical substrates of trait conscientiousness and the underlying brain mechanism linking trait conscientiousness and academic performance are still largely unknown. Here, we examined these issues in 148 high school students within the same grade by estimating cortical gray matter volume (GMV) utilizing a voxel-based morphometry method based on structural magnetic resonance imaging. A whole-brain regression analysis showed that trait conscientiousness was positively associated with the GMV in the bilateral superior parietal lobe (SPL) and was negatively associated with the GMV in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that trait conscientiousness mediated the influences of the SPL and MFG volume on academic performance. Importantly, our results persisted even when we adjusted for general intelligence, family socioeconomic status and 'big five' personality traits other than conscientiousness. Altogether, our study suggests that the GMV in the frontoparietal network is a neurostructural marker of adolescents' conscientiousness and reveals a potential brain-personality-achievement pathway for predicting academic performance in which gray matter structures affect academic performance through trait conscientiousness.", "As computational models inspired by the biological neural system, spiking neural networks (SNN) continue to demonstrate great potential in the landscape of artificial intelligence, particularly in tasks such as recognition, inference, and learning. While SNN focuses on achieving high-level intelligence of individual creatures, Swarm Intelligence (SI) is another type of bio-inspired models that mimic the collective intelligence of biological swarms, i.e., bird flocks, fish school and ant colonies. SI algorithms provide efficient and practical solutions to many difficult optimization problems through multi-agent metaheuristic search. Bridging these two distinct subfields of artificial intelligence has the potential to harness collective behavior and learning ability of biological systems. In this work, we explore the feasibility of connecting these two models by implementing a generalized SI model on SNN. In the proposed computing paradigm, we use SNNs to represent agents in the swarm and encode problem solutions with the spike firing rate and with spike timing. The coupled neurons communicate and modulate each other's action potentials through event-driven spikes and synchronize their dynamics around the states of optimal solutions. We demonstrate that such an SI-SNN model is capable of efficiently solving optimization problems, such as parameter optimization of continuous functions and a ubiquitous combinatorial optimization problem, namely, the traveling salesman problem with near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, we demonstrate an efficient implementation of such neural dynamics on an emerging hardware platform, namely ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) based spiking neurons. Such an emerging in-silico neuron is composed of a compact 1T-1FeFET structure with both excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We show that the designed neuromorphic system can serve as an optimization solver with high-performance and high energy-efficiency.", "Leadership within the healthcare system should be visible at all levels, rather than being dependent solely on the characteristics of those who exert control from the top of the organisation. All nurses can act as leaders, and providing effective leadership requires them to develop specific personal qualities and behaviours. This article explores four 'leadership intelligences' - spiritual, emotional, business or practice, and political - and discusses how understanding these can assist nurses to enhance their leadership skills. It also considers the evidence base for the use of these intelligences and how they can be adopted by individual nurses and healthcare organisations.", "Observer-driven pattern recognition is the standard for interpretation of medical images. To achieve global parity in interpretation, semi-quantitative scoring systems have been developed based on observer assessments; these are widely used in scoring coronary artery disease, the arthritides and neurological conditions and for indicating the likelihood of malignancy. However, in an era of machine learning and artificial intelligence, it is increasingly desirable that we extract quantitative biomarkers from medical images that inform on disease detection, characterisation, monitoring and assessment of response to treatment. Quantitation has the potential to provide objective decision-support tools in the management pathway of patients. Despite this, the quantitative potential of imaging remains under-exploited because of variability of the measurement, lack of harmonised systems for data acquisition and analysis, and crucially, a paucity of evidence on how such quantitation potentially affects clinical decision-making and patient outcome. This article reviews the current evidence for the use of semi-quantitative and quantitative biomarkers in clinical settings at various stages of the disease pathway including diagnosis, staging and prognosis, as well as predicting and detecting treatment response. It critically appraises current practice and sets out recommendations for using imaging objectively to drive patient management decisions.", "In cases where patients attempt suicide through intentional self-poisoning, they often ingest drugs such as benzodiazepines that alter the central nervous system and memory. This is problematic, given that experts recommend the recovery of a patient's cognitive capacity before any psychiatric assessment is conducted. A previous pilot study by our group showed that cognitive tests focusing on attention are the most valuable when it comes to determining whether sufficient cognitive recovery has occurred to ensure that patients will remember the assessment after intentional self-poisoning with benzodiazepines. The main aim of our study was to determine cognitive predictors of the recall of the psychiatric assessment after a suicide attempt. The second aim was to determine the threshold for episodic memory.\nWe recruited 97 patients admitted for intentional self-poisoning. At the time of the psychiatric assessments, we quantified plasma benzodiazepine levels and performed a cognitive assessment. We then used a linear regression model to identify the associations in a control and a benzodiazepine group between cognitive functions and episodic memory scores obtained 24\u2009hours after psychiatric assessment.\nOur model accounted for 28% and 37%, respectively, of the variance in memory in the control and benzodiazepine groups. The most significant correlations were found for the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale coding test in both groups. In the control group, tests such as visual and verbal memory were also associated with recall.\nBenzodiazepines particularly affect memory by impairing what is remembered of attentional tests. These are, however, the most suitable cognitive tests for predicting recall of the memory assessment.", "Addressing health-related risks for employees in the service sector, we identify emotion regulation (ER) ability-a dimension of emotional intelligence-as a promising resource with potential for facilitating emotional labor. We use an event-sampling design to investigate whether person-level ER ability moderates situation-dependent relationships of three different emotional labor strategies with emotional exhaustion in a beneficial way. Study 1 included data from 861 customer interactions from 187 service employees in the financial sector. All measures were self-ratings. Study 2 included 479 interactions from 101 employees in different service occupations; following a multimethod approach, ER ability was additionally assessed with peer ratings and an objective test. Controlling for age and gender, hierarchical linear modeling analyses indicated main effects of event-level surface acting and automatic regulation on emotional exhaustion in both studies. Multilevel results showed that ER ability-in contrast to the global score of emotional intelligence-moderated relationships of three different emotional labor strategies with exhaustion. In particular, resource loss via surface acting was buffered. Overall, findings contribute to knowledge on emotional abilities in emotional labor processes, and differences in operationalizing and assessing ER ability. Practical implications concerning employee health are given.

The aim was to identify a list of candidate best papers from the retrieved bibliographic records, which were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. A consensus meeting of the IMIA editorial team finally selected the best papers on the basis of all reviews and the section editors' evaluation.\nAmong 1,148 retrieved articles, 15 best paper candidates were selected, the review of which resulted in the selection of four best papers. The first paper introduces a deep learning model for estimating short-term life expectancy (>3 months) of metastatic cancer patients by analyzing free-text clinical notes in electronic medical records, while maintaining the temporal visit sequence. The second paper takes note that CDSSs become routinely integrated in health information systems and compares statistical anomaly detection models to identify CDSS malfunctions which, if remain unnoticed, may have a negative impact on care delivery. The third paper fairly reports on lessons learnt from the development of an oncology CDSS using artificial intelligence techniques and from its assessment in a large US cancer center. The fourth paper implements a preference learning methodology for detecting inconsistencies in clinical practice guidelines and illustrates the applicability of the proposed methodology to antibiotherapy.\nThree of the four best papers rely on data-driven methods, and one builds on a knowledge-based approach. While there is currently a trend for data-driven decision support, the promising results of such approaches still need to be confirmed by the adoption of these systems and their routine use.", "Progress in computing power and advances in medical imaging over recent decades have culminated in new opportunities for artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and using radiomics to facilitate clinical decision-making. These opportunities are growing in medical specialties, such as radiology, pathology, and oncology. As medical imaging and pathology are becoming increasingly digitized, it is recently recognized that harnessing data from digital images can yield parameters that reflect the underlying biology and physiology of various malignancies. This greater understanding of the behaviour of cancer can potentially improve on therapeutic strategies. In addition, the use of AI is particularly appealing in oncology to facilitate the detection of malignancies, to predict the likelihood of tumor response to treatments, and to prognosticate the patients' risk of cancer-related mortality. AI will be critical for identifying candidate biomarkers from digital imaging and developing robust and reliable predictive models. These models will be used to personalize oncologic treatment strategies, and identify confounding variables that are related to the complex biology of tumors and diversity of patient-related factors (ie, mining \"big data\"). This commentary describes the growing body of work focussed on AI for precision oncology. Advances in AI-driven computer vision and machine learning are opening new pathways that can potentially impact patient outcomes through response-guided adaptive treatments and targeted therapies based on radiomic and pathomic analysis.", "The world population is expected to grow by another two billion in 2050, according to the survey taken by the Food and Agriculture Organization, while the arable area is likely to grow only by 5%. Therefore, smart and efficient farming techniques are necessary to improve agriculture productivity. Agriculture land suitability assessment is one of the essential tools for agriculture development. Several new technologies and innovations are being implemented in agriculture as an alternative to collect and process farm information. The rapid development of wireless sensor networks has triggered the design of low-cost and small sensor devices with the Internet of Things (IoT) empowered as a feasible tool for automating and decision-making in the domain of agriculture. This research proposes an expert system by integrating sensor networks with Artificial Intelligence systems such as neural networks and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the assessment of agriculture land suitability. This proposed system will help the farmers to assess the agriculture land for cultivation in terms of four decision classes, namely more suitable, suitable, moderately suitable, and unsuitable. This assessment is determined based on the input collected from the various sensor devices, which are used for training the system. The results obtained using MLP with four hidden layers is found to be effective for the multiclass classification system when compared to the other existing model. This trained model will be used for evaluating future assessments and classifying the land after every cultivation.", "Executive functions (EF) are high-order cognitive skills that have a major influence on quality of life, social skills, and school achievement. We aimed to screen EF daily life abilities in young patients with myoclonic-atonic epilepsy (MAE) using an ecological questionnaire and to correlate EF to epilepsy characteristics.\nBehavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functions - Preschool (BRIEF-P) and BRIEF - for school-aged patients - parental questionnaires were proposed to patients with MAE and typically developing children (TDC) including Inhibit, Shift, Emotional control, Working memory (WM), Plan/Organize, Initiate, Organization of materials, and Monitor subscales. We included prospectively 12 patients with MAE and 44 TDC aged 3 to 5\u202fyears and seven patients with MAE and 21 TDC aged 6-7\u202fyears. We performed in addition for all patients an intellectual efficiency evaluation using WPPSI-IV (Wechsler intelligence scale for preschool children version IV) and collected demographics, age at onset of epilepsy, epilepsy duration, response to treatment, number and type of treatments including AEDs (antiepileptic drugs), and ketogenic diet.\nFour out of 12 patients for BRIEF-P and 6/7 patients for BRIEF had pathological scores for at least one domain. Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functions' questionnaires showed higher pathological scores for WM, Plan/Organize, Initiate, Monitor, and Metacognition Index in patients with MAE compared to TDC suggesting higher problems reported by parents. Working memory scores were higher in the group with MAE than TDC for both BRIEF-P and BRIEF. Response to treatment is a predictor of multiple BRIEF-P domains. Epilepsy duration predicts Shift and WM domains while age at onset predicts WM domain on BRIEF in this syndrome.\nThis study is the first to assess prospectively EF in young patients with MAE. We show everyday deficits in EF reported by parents. Metacognition and more specifically WM, appear to be a core deficit. Early evaluation of EF using both questionnaires and standardized tools is necessary for early detection of EF deficit and initiating tailored rehabilitation. Given the normal development before seizure onset and the absence of cerebral lesion in MAE, these results are in favor of the impact of epilepsy on EF.", "Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in digital health in recent years. Through one of the world\u2019s largest deployments to date of the open-source District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2), the country now has a national public sector health data warehouse. Information from previously fragmented data systems is now unified in a common data repository, enabling data exchange for health information systems and decision-making. Work is ongoing to create lifetime electronic health records for all citizens that can be transferred between health facilities. Extensive customization of open-source software has laid the foundations for a national digital networking system. Initiatives have focused on producing digital solutions to aid priorities such as strengthening the health system as a whole as well as supporting specific technical interventions, for example improving the civil registration and vital statistics system. Digital solutions have also supported the Bangladesh health workforce strategy through a set of registries that electronically captures and maintains human resource information for the entire public health sector, including monitoring staff attendance through the use of low-cost biometric fingerprint time-attendance machines. Citizens are encouraged to engage in shaping health services via a web-based complaints and suggestions system, and a new system to raise health awareness via public digital displays has started in Dhaka. Strong support at the highest political level has been critical to the success of efforts to introduce these innovations. The endeavour has also generated a cadre of enthusiastic eHealth proponents, who are focused on further strengthening and expanding the existing systems and on harnessing the vast amount of information amassed at the central data repository through big data analysis, artificial intelligence and machine learning.", "On the basis of a recent article \"Predicting reaction performance in C-N cross-coupling using machine learning\" that appeared in Science, we had decided to highlight the way forward for artificial intelligence in chemistry. Synthesis of molecules remains one of the most important challenges in organic chemistry, and the standard approach involved by a chemist to solve a problem is based on experience and constitutes a repetitive, time-consuming task, often resulting in nonoptimized solutions. Thus, considering the recent phenomenal progresses that have been made in machine learning, there is little doubt that these systems, once fully operational in organic chemistry, will dramatically speed up development of new drugs and will constitute the future of chemistry.", "Healthcare providers often perform under significant stress, during which their performance must be optimal, but is known to suffer. Stress management interventions in this context can provide cognitive support to rescue performance. This exploratory study sought to evaluate the effect of stress intervention components on stress and performance while clinicians engaged in two versions of a computer-based task, differing in overall level of demand: one high-stress and one low-stress. Participants (N\u2009=\u200945) were assigned to one of five groups (N\u2009=\u20099 per group), where they each completed both versions of the task, under different conditions of cognitive support. Group 1 received no intervention; Group 2 received biofeedback; and Group 3 received biofeedback and explicit coping instructions. Group 4 received emotional intelligence training, and Group 5 received emotional intelligence training and biofeedback. We hypothesized that Group 3 participants would present the lowest self-reported and physiological measures of stress, and the highest performance. Results reveal that the high-stress task induced significantly higher self-reported and physiological stress/anxiety, and lower task performance. No significant main effects of experimental condition or interaction effects were detected, indicating that intervention components had minimal effect on stress and performance. However, ultra-short term physiological analysis, analyzing <5\u2009min of HRV data, revealed significantly decreased stress (SDNN, the standard deviation of normal-to-normal peaks) following auditory coping instructions. Exploratory study results suggest that although cognitive intervention components had minimal effect on stress and performance, physiological stress may be significantly reduced immediately following adherence to a coping instruction intervention. Future work is needed.Lay summaryThis exploratory study evaluated the potential benefit of providing healthcare practitioners with various stress management components during an acutely stressful task. Our results support the positive effect of following behavioral coping instructions on immediate physiological measures of stress.", "Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype affects the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with inconclusive evidence on the opportunity to mitigate related adverse effects by lifestyle changes.\nTo examine the individual and interactive associations of APOE and objectively-measured physical activity (PA) and sedentary activity with cognitive decline.\nWe used data from middle-aged and older UK Biobank participants with repeat tests on visuospatial memory (n\u200a=\u200a52,767) and fluid intelligence (n\u200a=\u200a19,713), and who also took part in the accelerometer sub-study. PA and sedentary activity were assessed by a wrist-worn accelerometer over a seven-day period. Cognitive decline was defined as >1 standard deviation (SD) reduction in memory or fluid intelligence score, and the mean follow up from baseline was 5.8 years.\nThere was an age dependent association between APOE\u025b4 genotype and memory decline (page-interaction\u200a=\u200a0.01), with the association only seen in participants who were >65 years (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.24; for <65 years OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.14). The OR for the APOE\u025b4 association with fluid intelligence decline was 1.11 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.24), and there was no evidence for age interaction (page-interaction\u200a=\u200a0.99). High PA and low sedentary activity were associated with reduced mean memory decline (p\u200a<\u200a0.02 for both). There was no interaction between PA or sedentary activity with APOE\u025b4 regarding either of the cognitive decline measures (p\u200a>\u200a0.63 for all).\nThis large-scale study using objectively measured PA did not find differential effects of PA on cognitive decline based on APOE genotype.", "Decision-making (DM) is a component of executive functioning. DM is essential to make proper decisions regarding important life and health issues. DM can be impaired in cognitive disorders among older adults, but current literature is scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the DM profile in participants with and without cognitive impairment.\nCross-sectional analysis of a cohort study on cognitive aging.\n143 older adults.\nUniversity-based memory clinic.\nPatients comprised three groups after inclusion and exclusion criteria: healthy controls (n=29), mild cognitive impairment (n=81) and dementia (n=33). Participants were evaluated using an extensive neuropsychological protocol. DM profile was evaluated by the Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between age, sex, educational level, estimated intelligence quotient (IQ), cognitive disorders, depressive or anxiety symptoms, and the DM profiles.\nThe most prevalent DM profile was the vigilant type, having a prevalence of 64.3%. The vigilant profile also predominated in all three groups. The multinomial logistic regression showed that the avoidance profile (i.e. buck-passing) was associated with a greater presence of dementia (p=0.046) and depressive symptoms (p=0.024), but with less anxious symptoms (p=0.047). The procrastination profile was also associated with depressive symptoms (p=0.048). Finally, the hypervigilant profile was associated with a lower pre-morbid IQ (p=0.007).\nOlder adults with cognitive impairment tended to make more unfavorable choices and have a more dysfunctional DM profile compared to healthy elders.", "The present study introduces a novel cognitive intervention aimed at improving fluid intelligence (Gf), based on a framework we refer to as FAST: Flexible, Adaptive, Synergistic Training. FAST leverages a combination of novel game-based executive function (EF) training-designed specifically to enhance the likelihood of transfer-and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), with aims to synergistically activate and strengthen mechanisms of cognitive control critical to Gf. To test our intervention, we collected three Gf measures from 113 participants [the advanced short Bochumer Matrizen-Test (BOMAT), Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), and matrices similar to Raven's generated by Sandia labs], prior to and following one of three interventions: (1) the FAST + tRNS intervention, a combination of 30 min of daily training with our novel training game, Robot Factory, and 20 min of concurrent transcranial random noise stimulation applied to bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); (2) an adaptively difficult Active Control intervention comprised of visuospatial tasks that specifically do not target Gf; or (3) a no-contact control condition. Analyses of changes in a Gf factor from pre- to post-test found numerical increases for the FAST + tRNS group compared to the two control conditions, with a 0.3 SD increase relative to Active Control (p = 0.07), and a 0.19 SD increase relative to a No-contact control condition (p = 0.26). This increase was found to be largely driven by significant differences in pre- and post-test Gf as measured on the BOMAT test. Progression through the FAST training game (Robot Factory) was significantly correlated with changes in Gf. This is in contrast with progress in the Active Control condition, as well as with changes in individual EFs during FAST training, which did not significantly correlate with changes in Gf. Taken together, this research represents a useful step forward in providing new insights into, and new methods for studying, the nature of Gf and its malleability. Though our results await replication and extension, they provide preliminary evidence that the crucial characteristic of Gf may, in fact, be the ability to combine EFs rapidly and adaptively according to changing demand, and that Gf may be susceptible to targeted training.", "Exploring Internet of Things (IoT) data streams generated by smart cities means not only transforming data into better business decisions in a timely way but also generating long-term location intelligence for developing new forms of urban governance and organization policies. This paper proposes a new architecture based on the edge-fog-cloud continuum to analyze IoT data streams for delivering data-driven insights in a smart parking scenario.", "The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials with high critical temperature and intrinsic magnetic properties has attracted significant research interest. By using swarm-intelligence structure search and first-principles calculations, we predict three 2D iron arsenide monolayers (denoted as FeAs-I, II and III) with good energetic and dynamical stabilities. We find that FeAs-I and II are ferromagnets, while FeAs-III is an antiferromagnet. FeAs-I and III have sizable magnetic anisotropy comparable to the magnetic recording materials such as the FeCo alloy. Importantly, we show that FeAs-I and III have critical temperatures of 645 K and 350 K, respectively, which are above room temperature. In addition, FeAs-I and II are metallic, while FeAs-III is semiconducting with a gap comparable to Si. For FeAs-III, there exist two pairs of 2D antiferromagnetic Dirac points below the Fermi level, and it displays a giant magneto band-structure effect. The superior magnetic and electronic properties of the FeAs monolayers make them promising candidates for spintronics applications.", "This study reviews the scientific literature to identify and describe which assessment tools (ATs) are used in pediatric oncology and neuro-oncology rehabilitation and which development neuropsychomotor (DNPM) ATs were built for children with central nervous system (CNS) tumors.\nA systematic review was performed searching PubMed, CINAHL, PEDro, Science Direct, and Catalog of National Institute of Tumors databases and specialized journals. The search covered 7 years (2010-2017) and used relevant keywords in different combinations. A further search was carried out on DNPM rehabilitation manuals and academic thesis.\nThe review retrieved 35 eligible articles containing 63 ATs. The most common ATs were the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). Most of the ATs covered a single area of child development among behavioral/psychological, cognitive, and motor areas. A total of 159 ATs were found in manuals and thesis, and only 17 of them were already identified in the journal search. None of the ATs identified in both searches had been specifically developed for children with CNS tumor.\nThe results highlight the need to develop and validate a global multidimensional AT for children with CNS tumor, overcoming the fragmentation of the assessment procedures and promoting standardized rehabilitation protocols.", "Summary Vestibular disorders are a group of disorders that may result from damage to peripheral or central vestibular system, which seriously affect the patients' lives and work and even life-threatened. The causes of most vestibular disorders are still unclear, the auxiliary examination is not effective enough and the treatment is not individualized. It needs to improve the diagnosis and treatment efficiency of patients with vestibular disorders. Recent advance in artificial intelligence technology could provide novel promising strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of patients and assist clinical trials. Here we summarized the application of artificial intelligence technique in the field of vertigo, and look to the possible application in the future.", "Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in many fields of medicine, assisting physicians in most steps of patient management. In nephrology, artificial intelligence can already be used to improve clinical care, hemodialysis prescriptions, and follow-up of transplant recipients. However, many nephrologists are still unfamiliar with the basic principles of medical artificial intelligence. This review seeks to provide an overview of medical artificial intelligence relevant to the practicing nephrologist, in all fields of nephrology. We define the core concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning and cover the basics of the functioning of neural networks and deep learning. We also discuss the most recent clinical applications of artificial intelligence in nephrology and medicine; as an example, we describe how artificial intelligence can predict the occurrence of progressive immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Finally, we consider the future of artificial intelligence in clinical nephrology and its impact on medical practice, and conclude with a discussion of the ethical issues that the use of artificial intelligence raises in terms of clinical decision making, physician-patient relationship, patient privacy, and data collection.", "The coming wave of patent expiries of first generation commercialized biotherapeutical drugs has seen the global market open its doors to close copies of these products. These near perfect substitutes, which are termed as \"biosimilars\", do not need to undergo intense clinical trials for their approval. However, they are mandated to produce identical similarity from their reference biologics in terms of clinical safety and efficacy. As such, these biosimilar products promise to foster unprecedented access to a wide range of life-saving biologics. However, seeing this promise be fulfilled requires the development of biosimilars to be augmented with product trust, predictable regulatory frameworks, and sustainable policies. It is vital for healthcare and marketing professionals to understand the critical challenges surrounding biosimilar use and implement informed clinical and commercial decisions. A proper framework of pharmacovigilance, education, and scientific exchange for biologics and biosimilars would ensure a dramatic rise in healthcare access and market sustainability. This paper seeks to collate and review all relevant published intelligence of the health and business potential of biosimilars. In doing so, it provides a visualization of the essential steps that are required to be taken for global biosimilar acceptance.", "In recent years, the development and application of emerging information technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, Internet of Things, and wearable devices, has expanded the content of electronic health (e-health). Electronic health has become a research focus, but few studies have explored its knowledge structure from a global perspective.\nTo detect the evolution track, knowledge base and research hotspots of e-health, we conducted a series of bibliometric analyses on the retrieved 3,085 papers from the Web of Science core database in 1992-2017. We used several bibliometric tools, such as HistCite, CiteSpace, NetDraw, and NEViewer, to describe the evolution process, time-and-space knowledge map, and hotspots in e-health.\nThe research results are as follows. (a) The number of publications has been obviously increasing after 2005 and according to the trend line it is expected to continue increase exponentially in the future. (b) Countries/regions conducting e-health research have close cooperative relationship, among which European countries have the closest cooperation. (c) Electronic health records, mobile health and health information technology are research hotspots in electronic health. Moreover, scholars also pay attention to the hot issues such as privacy, security, and quality improvement.\nElectronic health is a large and growing field with quite a number of research articles in medical journals.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the global trend in artificial intelligence (AI)-based research productivity involving radiology and its subspecialty disciplines. CONCLUSION. The United States is the global leader in AI radiology publication productivity, accounting for almost half of total radiology AI output. Other countries have increased their productivity. Notably, China has increased its productivity exponentially to close to 20% of all AI publications. The top three most productive radiology subspecialties were neuroradiology, body and chest, and nuclear medicine.", "wearable sensors are often used to acquire data for gait analysis as a strategy to study fall events, due to greater availability of acquisition platforms, and advances in computational intelligence. However, there are no review papers addressing the three most common types of applications related to fall using sensors, namely: fall detection, fallers classification and fall risk screening.\nTo identify the state of art of fall-related events detection in older person using wearable sensors, as well as the main characteristics of the studies in the literature, pointing gaps for future studies.\nA systematic review design was used to search peer-reviewed literature on fall detection and risk in elderly through inertial sensors, published in English, Portuguese, Spanish or French between August 2002 and June 2019. The following questions are investigated: the type of sensors and their sampling rate, the type of signal and data processing employed, the scales and tests used in the study and the type of application.\nWe identified 608 studies, from which 29 were included. The accelerometer, with sampling rate 50 or 100\u202fHz, allocated in the waist or lumbar was the most used sensor setting. Methods comparing features or variables extracted from the accelerometry signal are the most common, and fall risk screening the most observed application.\nThis review identifies the main elements to be addressed in studies on the detection of events related to falls in the elderly and may help in future studies on the subject. However, some aspects are still no reach consensus in the literature such as the size of the sample to be studied, the population under study and how to acquire data for each application.", "We developed a system for computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) for real-time automated diagnosis of precancerous lesions and early esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) to assist the diagnosis of esophageal cancer.\nA total of 6473 narrow-band imaging (NBI) images, including precancerous lesions, early ESCCs, and noncancerous lesions, were used to train the CAD system. We validated the CAD system using both endoscopic images and video datasets. The receiver operating characteristic curve of the CAD system was generated based on image datasets. An artificial intelligence probability heat map was generated for each input of endoscopic images. The yellow color indicated high possibility of cancerous lesion, and the blue color indicated noncancerous lesions on the probability heat map. When the CAD system detected any precancerous lesion or early ESCCs, the lesion of interest was masked with color.\nThe image datasets contained 1480 malignant NBI images from 59 consecutive cancerous cases (sensitivity, 98.04%) and 5191 noncancerous NBI images from 2004 cases (specificity, 95.03%). The area under curve was 0.989. The video datasets of precancerous lesions or early ESCCs included 27 nonmagnifying videos (per-frame sensitivity 60.8%, per-lesion sensitivity, 100%) and 20 magnifying videos (per-frame sensitivity 96.1%, per-lesion sensitivity, 100%). Unaltered full-range normal esophagus videos included 33 videos (per-frame specificity 99.9%, per-case specificity, 90.9%).\nA deep learning model demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for both endoscopic images and video datasets.

With increasing studies researching cognitive function of Chinese patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) using MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), it is not clear about the level and pattern of cognitive impairment among this population.\nTo provide a meta-analysis systematically analysing studies of neurocognitive function using MCCB in Chinese patients with FES.\nAn independent literature search of both Chinese and English databases up to 13 March 2019 was conducted by two reviewers. Standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated using the random effects model to evaluate the effect size.\n56 studies (FES=3167, healthy controls (HC)=3017) were included and analysed. No study was rated as 'high quality' according to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology. Compared with HCs, Chinese patients with FES showed impairment with large effect size in overall cognition (SMD=-1.60, 95% CI -1.82 to -1.38, I 2=67%) and all seven cognitive domains, with the SMD ranging from -0.87 to -1.41. In nine MCCB subtests, patients with FES showed significant difference in Symbol Coding (SMD=-1.90), Trail Making Test (TMT) (SMD=-1.36), Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs (SMD=-1.33), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (SMD=-1.24), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (SMD=-1.18), Mazes (SMD=-1.16), Category Fluency (SMD=-1.01), Spatial Span (SMD=-0.69) and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (SMD=-0.38).\nOur meta-analysis demonstrates that Chinese patients with FES show neurocognitive deficits across all seven MCCB cognitive domains and all nine subtests, particularly in two neurocognitive domains: speed of processing and attention/vigilance, with the least impairment shown in social cognition. Symbol Coding and TMT may be the most sensitive tests to detect cognitive deficit in Chinese patients with FES.", "Quality\u00a0monitoring is increasingly important to support and assure sustainability of the orthopedic practice. Surgeons in nonacademic settings often lack resources to accurately monitor quality of care. Widespread use of electronic medical records (EMR) provides easier access to medical information, facilitating its analysis. However, manual review of EMRs is highly inefficient. Artificial intelligence (AI) software allows for the development of algorithms for extracting relevant complications from EMRs. We hypothesized that an AI-supported algorithm for complication data extraction would have an accuracy level equal to or higher than manual review after total hip arthroplasty (THA).\nA total of 532 consecutive patients underwent 613 THA between January 1 and December 31, 2017. A random derivation cohort (100 patients, 115 hips) was used to determine accuracy. After generation of a gold standard, the algorithm was compared to manual extraction to validate performance in raw data extraction. The full cohort (532 patients, 613 hips) was used to determine recall, precision, and F-value.\nAI accuracy was 95.0%, compared to 94.5% for manual review (P\u00a0= .69). Recall of 96.0% (84.0%-100%), precision of 88.0% (33%-100%) and F-measure of 0.85 (0.5-1) was achieved for all adverse events. No adverse events were recorded in 80.6%, 1.3% required reintervention and 18.1% had\u00a0\"transient\"\u00a0events.\nThe use of an automated, AI-supported search algorithm for EMRs provided continuous feedback on the quality of care with a performance level comparable to manual data extraction, but with\u00a0greater speed. New clinical information surfaced, as 18.1% of patients can be expected to have \"transient\"\u00a0problems.", "Some electroencephalography (EEG) studies have investigated emotional intelligence (EI), but none have examined the relationships between EI and commercial advertising messages and related consumer behaviors. This study combines brain (EEG) techniques with an EI psychometric to explore the brain responses associated with a range of advertisements. A group of 45 participants (23 females, 22 males) had their EEG recorded while watching a series of advertisements selected from various marketing categories such as community interests, celebrities, food/drink, and social issues. Participants were also categorized as high or low in emotional intelligence (n = 34). The EEG data analysis was centered on rating decision-making in order to measure brain responses associated with advertising information processing for both groups. The findings suggest that participants with high and low emotional intelligence (EI) were attentive to different types of advertising messages. The two EI groups demonstrated preferences for \"people\" or \"object,\" related advertising information. This suggests that differences in consumer perception and emotions may suggest why certain advertising material or marketing strategies are effective or not.", "This study was conducted to investigate the influence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score on the diagnostic performance of machine-learning-based coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography (cCTA)-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR).\nCT-FFR is used reliably to detect lesion-specific ischemia. Novel CT-FFR algorithms using machine-learning artificial intelligence techniques perform fast and require less complex computational fluid dynamics. Yet, influence of CAC score on diagnostic performance of the machine-learning approach has not been investigated.\nA total of 482 vessels from 314 patients (age 62.3 \u00b1 9.3 years, 77% male) who underwent cCTA followed by invasive FFR were investigated from the MACHINE (Machine Learning based CT Angiography derived FFR: a Multi-center Registry) registry data. CAC scores were quantified using the Agatston convention. The diagnostic performance of CT-FFR to detect lesion-specific ischemia was assessed across all Agatston score categories (CAC 0, >0 to\u00a0<100, 100 to\u00a0<400, and\u00a0\u2265400) on a per-vessel level with invasive FFR as the reference standard.\nThe diagnostic accuracy of CT-FFR versus invasive FFR was superior to cCTA alone on a per-vessel level (78% vs. 60%) and per patient level (83% vs. 73%) across all Agatston score categories. No statistically significant differences in the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity of CT-FFR were observed across the categories. CT-FFR showed good discriminatory power in vessels with high Agatston scores (CAC\u00a0\u2265400) and high performance in low-to-intermediate Agatston scores (CAC >0 to\u00a0<400) with a statistically significant difference in the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) (AUC: 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57 to 0.85] vs. 0.85 [95%\u00a0CI: 0.82 to 0.89], p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). CT-FFR showed superior diagnostic value over cCTA in vessels with high Agatston scores (CAC\u00a0\u2265 400: AUC 0.71 vs. 0.55, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and low-to-intermediate Agatston scores (CAC >0 to\u00a0<400: AUC 0.86 vs. 0.63, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nMachine-learning-based CT-FFR showed superior diagnostic performance over cCTA alone in CAC with a significant difference in the performance of CT-FFR as calcium burden/Agatston calcium score increased.

Key challenges exist in understanding the data for robust clinical decision-support. Limitations of traditional methodologies to handle these data led to the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). This article emphasizes the capabilities of AI to identify patterns of SSI data. Method: Artificial intelligence comprises various subfields that present potential solutions to identify patterns of SSI data. Discussions on opportunities, challenges, and limitations of applying these methods to derive accurate SSI prediction are provided. Results: Four main challenges in dealing with SSI data were defined: (1) complexities in using SSI data, (2) disease knowledge, (3) decision support, and (4) heterogeneity. The implications of some of the recent advances in AI methods to optimize clinical effectiveness were discussed. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence has the potential to provide insight in detecting and decision-support of SSI. As we turn SSI data into intelligence about the disease, we increase the possibility of improving surgical practice with the promise of a future optimized for the highest quality patient care.", "Cognitive reserve is one's mental resilience or resistance to the effects of structural brain damage. Reserve effects are well established in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and Alzheimer's disease, but the neural basis of this phenomenon is unclear. We aimed to investigate whether preservation of functional connectivity explains cognitive reserve. Seventy-four PwMS and 29 HCs underwent neuropsychological assessment and 3 T MRI. Structural damage measures included gray matter (GM) atrophy and network white matter (WM) tract disruption between pairs of GM regions. Resting-state functional connectivity was also assessed. PwMS exhibited significantly impaired cognitive processing speed (t = 2.14, p = .037) and visual/spatial memory (t = 2.72, p = .008), and had significantly greater variance in functional connectivity relative to HCs within relevant networks (p\u2009<\u2009.001, p\u2009<\u2009.001, p = .016). Higher premorbid verbal intelligence, a proxy for cognitive reserve, predicted relative preservation of functional connectivity despite accumulation of GM atrophy (standardized-\u03b2 = .301, p = .021). Furthermore, preservation of functional connectivity attenuated the impact of structural network WM tract disruption on cognition (\u03b2 = -.513, p = .001, for cognitive processing speed; \u03b2 = -.209, p = .066, for visual/spatial memory). The data suggests that preserved functional connectivity explains cognitive reserve in PwMS, helping to maintain cognitive capacity despite structural damage.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has influenced all aspects of human life and neurology is no exception to this growing trend. The aim of this paper is to guide medical practitioners on the relevant aspects of artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning, and deep learning, to review the development of technological advancement equipped with AI, and to elucidate how machine learning can revolutionize the management of neurological diseases. This review focuses on unsupervised aspects of machine learning, and how these aspects could be applied to precision neurology to improve patient outcomes. We have mentioned various forms of available AI, prior research, outcomes, benefits and limitations of AI, effective accessibility and future of AI, keeping the current burden of neurological disorders in mind.\nThe smart device system to monitor tremors and to recognize its phenotypes for better outcomes of deep brain stimulation, applications evaluating fine motor functions, AI integrated electroencephalogram learning to diagnose epilepsy and psychological non-epileptic seizure, predict outcome of seizure surgeries, recognize patterns of autonomic instability to prevent sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), identify the pattern of complex algorithm in neuroimaging classifying cognitive impairment, differentiating and classifying concussion phenotypes, smartwatches monitoring atrial fibrillation to prevent strokes, and prediction of prognosis in dementia are unique examples of experimental utilizations of AI in the field of neurology. Though there are obvious limitations of AI, the general consensus among several nationwide studies is that this new technology has the ability to improve the prognosis of neurological disorders and as a result should become a staple in the medical community.\nAI not only helps to analyze medical data in disease prevention, diagnosis, patient monitoring, and development of new protocols, but can also assist clinicians in dealing with voluminous data in a more accurate and efficient manner.", "This article presents a systematic review of the current computational technologies applied to medical images for the detection, segmentation, and classification of strokes. Besides, analyzing and evaluating the technological advances, the challenges to be overcome and the future trends are discussed. The principal approaches make use of artificial intelligence, digital image processing and analysis, and various other technologies to develop computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to improve the accuracy in the diagnostic process, as well as the interpretation consistency of medical images. However, there are some points that require greater attention such as low sensitivity, optimization of the algorithm, a reduction of false positives, and improvement in the identification and segmentation processes of different sizes and shapes. Also, there is a need to improve the classification steps of different stroke types and subtypes. Furthermore, there is an additional need for further research to improve the current techniques and develop new algorithms to overcome disadvantages identified here. The main focus of this research is to analyze the applied technologies for the development of CAD systems and verify how effective they are for stroke detection, segmentation, and classification. The main contributions of this review are that it analyzes only up-to-date studies, mainly from 2015 to 2018, as well as organizing the various studies in the area according to the research proposal, i.e., detection, segmentation, and classification of the types of stroke and the respective techniques used. Thus, the review has great relevance for future research, since it presents an ample comparison of the most recent works in the area, clearly showing the existing difficulties and the models that have been proposed to overcome such difficulties.", "Significant efforts are being made to develop artificial intelligence technologies for health settings. In a health system that has been notoriously slow to adopt innovative technologies, it is important to consider the implementation of a new technology early in the development stage, especially one that will have added challenges of trust and transparency. To facilitate this process, an implementation framework for artificial intelligence technologies in clinical settings has been created.", "Patients with schizophrenia exhibit impairments in their social activity, intelligence quotient (IQ), daily living skills, and social function. Social activity is a high-order outcome measure of their lives. Here we attempted to longitudinally evaluate the effects of IQ, daily living skills, social function, psychiatric symptoms, and medications on social activity in patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of the current study is to identify the specific factor that affects longitudinal changes in social activity. Sixty-five patients with schizophrenia were assessed at two time points [time 2 (T2, follow-up) - time 1 (T1, baseline) = 1.71 \u00b1 0.79 years]. Social activity, IQ, daily living skills, and social function were assessed using the Social Activity Assessment (SAA; h/week), short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III (WAIS-SF), University of California San Diego (UCSD) Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA), and Social Functioning Scale (SFS), respectively. IQ, daily living skills, social function, and social activity were significantly improved between T1 and T2 (t = 2.0-4.4, p = 0.048-3.60 \u00d7 10-5). IQ, daily living skills, and social function positively correlated with social activity (lowest p = 1.27 \u00d7 10-5), and psychiatric symptoms negatively correlated with social activity over time (lowest p = 3.26 \u00d7 10-9). The longitudinal change in social activity was independently and positively correlated with a change in social function (beta = 0.35, p = 4.63 \u00d7 10-3), particularly interpersonal communication (beta = 0.35, p = 4.32 \u00d7 10-3). The longitudinal changes in other factors did not directly affect the change in social activity (p > 0.05). Based on these findings, social activity is more affected by social function than by other factors.", "To summarize significant research contributions to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in health in 2018.\nOvid MEDLINE\u00ae and Web of Science\u00ae databases were searched to identify original research articles that were published in the English language during 2018 and presented advances in the science of AI applied in health.

Final best papers were selected by the editorial board of the 2018 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook.\nDatabase searches returned 1,480 unique publications. Best papers employed innovative AI techniques that incorporated domain knowledge or explored approaches to support distributed or federated learning. All top-ranked papers incorporated novel approaches to advance the science of AI in health and included rigorous evaluations of their methodologies.\nPerformance of state-of-the-art AI machine learning algorithms can be enhanced by approaches that employ a multidisciplinary biomedical informatics pipeline to incorporate domain knowledge and can overcome challenges such as sparse, missing, or inconsistent data. Innovative training heuristics and encryption techniques may support distributed learning with preservation of privacy.", "Chronic diseases are the leading cause of morbidity, disability and mortality worldwide. It is well established that the majority of chronic diseases can be prevented by targeting modifiable lifestyle-related risk factors. Thus, early risk assessment and mitigation at the individual level can significantly reduce the health and economic burden of chronic diseases. Lifetime health has emerged as a potential paradigm to assist individuals to avoid harmful lifestyle-related habits to reduce the risk of chronic morbidity. In this paper, we leverage eHealth and Quantified Self technologies, novel health data visualizations, and artificial intelligence methods to develop a digital-based lifetime health platform (PRISM) to empower individuals to self-assess, self-monitor, and self-manage their risks for multiple chronic diseases and associated morbidities.", "This study examined both children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing students in dynamic measures of intelligence through the use of a virtual avatar. Three conditions were compared: in the first condition, the avatar simply gave the instructions; in the second condition, the avatar presented the instructions and gave feedback on the attention of the learner; in the third condition, the avatar was not presented. Results indicated that ADHD subtypes do not differ in problem solving and the interactive avatar improved the performance of groups with ADHD in the dynamic intelligence test. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that the function of regulation and feedback of the avatar improve the attention process and, consequently, boosts performance.", "This commentary explores the issues raised in the original article and seeks to suggest how the systems and processes that the professionals utilize shape the challenges and issues they face. Furthermore, it asks the question as to the extent to which self-determination in the selection of many forms of assistive technology would address and resolve the barriers identified.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe implications of the study and experiences of the professionals are highly relevant for the planning of future rehabilitation services. With increasing global demand for service, and an associated understanding that the client carries significant knowledge and experience it could be suggested that the underlying client/provider relationship is changing and will continue to change.There is potential for a shift from community-based rehabilitation services, to community led rehabilitation services, where the self-determination of solutions to need is led by the individual, with curated input from the professional, mediated through machine learning and artificial intelligence. Such a model of delivery could effectively support many of those with a disability, where the client has extensive experience, allowing the professional to spend increased resources on those who lack the experience to engage confidently in decision making.The recognition and validation of the knowledge held by clients, against which options can be mapped could ensure extended reach and reduce the cost and efficiency of future services.", "The purpose was to examine the association between exercise during pregnancy and intelligence score in offspring. We analyzed data from 4008 women from the Aarhus Birth Cohort, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, recruited during pregnancy from July 1989 to November 1991 and their sons who were registered at conscription at 17-20\u00a0years of age. The women gave information by self-administered questionnaires during the first trimester including leisure-time physical activity and weekly hours of sport. This information was linked to the sons' measures of intelligence by B\u00f8rge Priens test scores from the Danish Conscription Registry. Only sons were included since very few women register at conscription in Denmark. The main outcome measure was the B\u00f8rge Priens test score as a continuous variable and with a low score defined as <10% of the population score. Analyses were adjusted for maternal body mass index, years in school, and smoking. Sons of women with light and moderate to heavy leisure-time physical activity had lower risk of having a low intelligence score compared with sons of women with sedentary activity: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.66 (95% CI 0.49;0.88) and 0.46 (95% CI 0.23;0.93), respectively. Furthermore, sons of women engaged in sports had lower risk of a low intelligence score: aOR 0.50 (95% CI 0.30; 0.83) for 1-2\u00a0h/wk and 0.62 (95% CI 0.35; 1.10) for \u22653\u00a0h/wk compared with no weekly sports activity. In conclusion, a higher level of physical activity during pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of low intelligence score in early adulthood in sons.", "Many recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are rooted in visual neuroscience. However, ideas from more complicated paradigms like decision-making are less used. Although automated decision-making systems are ubiquitous (driverless cars, pilot support systems, medical diagnosis algorithms etc.), achieving human-level performance in decision making tasks is still a challenge. At the same time, these tasks that are hard for AI are easy for humans. Thus, understanding human brain dynamics during these decision-making tasks and modeling them using deep neural networks could improve AI performance. Here we modelled some of the complex neural interactions during a sensorimotor decision making task. We investigated how brain dynamics flexibly represented and distinguished between sensory processing and categorization in two sensory domains: motion direction and color. We used two different approaches for understanding neural representations. We compared brain responses to 1) the geometry of a sensory or category domain (domain selectivity) and 2) predictions from deep neural networks (computation selectivity). Both approaches gave us similar results. This confirmed the validity of our analyses. Using the first approach, we found that neural representations changed depending on context. We then trained deep recurrent neural networks to perform the same tasks as the animals. Using the second approach, we found that computations in different brain areas also changed flexibly depending on context. Color computations appeared to rely more on sensory processing, while motion computations more on abstract categories. Overall, our results shed light to the biological basis of categorization and differences in selectivity and computations in different brain areas. They also suggest a way for studying sensory and categorical representations in the brain: compare brain responses to both a behavioral model and a deep neural network and test if they give similar results.", "Mental retardation is a progressive condition in Down syndrome: intelligence starts to decline linearly within the first year. This phenomenon could be related to the overproduction of a toxic compound, hydrogen sulfide. Indeed, a gene located on chromosome 21 controls the production of cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase, an enzyme involved in hydrogen sulfide production in the central nervous system. It has recently been demonstrated that excess cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase levels are needed and sufficient to induce cognitive phenotypes in mouse models of Down syndrome. Thus, two therapeutic options might be used in Down syndrome patients: the use of a specific cystathionine \u03b2-synthase inhibitor and the use of an effective antidote to reduce hydrogen sulfide toxicity. Prenatal treatment of Down syndrome fetuses is also suggested.", "Management improvement was strongly required at public hospital and Local Incorporated Administrative Agency hospitals in Japan. We analysed financial statements of 880 public hospitals using Business Intelligence System. In order to raise the efficiency of management, it is important to have patients with a high profitability (seriously ill patients) at municipal hospitals; whereas, in Local Incorporated Administrative Agency hospitals, avoiding producing ordinary losses and not incurring excessive expenses will be important for management improvement.", "Health monitoring is shifting towards continuous, ambulatory and clinically comparable wearable devices. Telemedicine and remote diagnosis could harness the capability of mobile cardiac health information, as the technology on bio-physical signal monitoring has improved significantly.\nThe purpose of this review article is (1) to systematically assess the viability of ambulatory electrocardiography (ECG), (2) to provide a systems level understanding of a broad spectrum of wearable heart signal monitoring approaches and (3) to identify areas of improvement in the existing technology needed to attain clinical grade diagnosis.\nBased on the included literature, we have identified (1) that the developments in ECG monitoring through wearable devices are reaching feasibility, and are capable of delivering diagnostic and prognostic information, (2) that reliable sensing is the major bottleneck in the entire process of ambulatory monitoring, (3) that there is a strong need for artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to parse and infer the biosignals and (4) that aspects of wearer comfort has largely been ignored in the prevailing developments, which can become a key factor for consumer acceptance.\nCardiac health information is crucial for diagnosis and prevention of several disease onsets. Mobile and continuous monitoring can aid avoiding risks involved with acute symptoms. The health information obtained through continuous monitoring can serve as the BigData of heart signals, and can facilitate new treatment methods and devise effective health policies.", "This article describes a project that assessed whether routinely collected antibiotic prescribing and NHS dental treatment data could be linked to produce personalised prescribing profiles for general dental practitioners working in Wales, UK.

Despite this breakthrough, the median survival time of glioblastoma patients has remained at about 2\u2009years. Therefore, the safety and anti-cancer efficacy of combination therapies that include ICMs are being actively investigated. Because of the distinct mechanisms of ICMs, which restore the immune system's anti-tumor capacity, unconventional immune-related phenomena are increasingly being reported in terms of tumor response and progression, as well as adverse events. Indeed, immunotherapy response assessments for neuro-oncology (iRANO) play a central role in guiding cancer patient management and define a \"wait and see strategy\" for patients treated with ICMs in monotherapy with progressive disease on MRI. This article deciphers emerging research trends to ameliorate four challenges unaddressed by the iRANO criteria: (1) patient selection, (2) identification of immune-related phenomena other than pseudoprogression (i.e., hyperprogression, the abscopal effect, immune-related adverse events), (3) response assessment in combination therapies including ICM, and (4) alternatives to MRI. To this end, our article provides a structured approach for standardized selection and reporting of imaging modalities to enable the use of precision medicine by deciphering the characteristics of the tumor and its immune environment. Emerging preclinical or clinical innovations are also discussed as future directions such as immune-specific targeting and implementation of artificial intelligence algorithms.", "Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a difficult diagnosis to make clinically, with clinical examination of even otolaryngologists showing poor sensitivity and specificity. Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that \"learns\" from data to make predictions. We developed a machine learning classifier to predict the diagnosis of PTA based on patient symptoms. We retrospectively collected clinical data and symptomatology from 916 patients who underwent attempted needle aspiration for PTA. Machine learning classifiers were trained on a subset of the data to predict the presence or absence of purulence on attempted aspiration. The performance of the model was evaluated on a holdout set. The accuracy of the top-performing algorithm, the artificial neural network, was 72.3%. Artificial neural networks can use patient symptoms to exceed human ability to predict PTA in patients with clinical suspicion for PTA. Similar models can assist medical decision making for clinicians who have suspicion of PTA.", "Adequate postoperative pain management is crucial in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery because pain can lead to devastating short- and long-term consequences. This review discusses the limitations of current postoperative pain assessment and management in children after cardiac surgery, the obstacles to providing optimal treatment, and concepts to consider that may overcome these barriers.\nMEDLINE and PubMed.\nEffective pain management in infants and young children undergoing cardiac surgery continues to evolve with innovative methods of both assessment and therapy using newer drugs or novel routes of administration. Artificial intelligence- and machine learning-based pain assessment and patient-tailored management in both pain measurement and prevention are already being integrated into the routine of current practice.", "Much testing in medicine is aimed at healthy people to facilitate the early detection of health conditions. However, there is growing evidence that early detection is a double-edged sword that may cause harm in the form of overdiagnosis. The media can be seen as a major generator of consumer demand for health services. Previous research shows that media coverage tends to overstate the benefits and downplay the harms of medical interventions for the sick, and often fails to cover relevant conflicts of interest of those promoting those interventions. However, little is known about how the benefits and harms of testing the healthy are covered by media. This study will examine the media coverage of the benefits and harms of testing the healthy, and coverage of potential conflicts of interest of those promoting the testing.\nWe will examine five tests: 3D mammography for the early detection of breast cancer; blood liquid biopsy for the early detection of cancer; blood biomarker tests for the early detection of dementia; artificial intelligence technology for the early detection of dementia; and the Apple Watch Series 4 electrocardiogram sensor for the early detection of atrial fibrillation. We will identify media coverage using Google News and the LexisNexis and ProQuest electronic databases. Sets of two independent reviewers will conduct story screening and coding. We will include English language media stories referring to any of the five tests from January 2016 to May 2019. We will include media stories if they refer to any benefits or harms of the test for our conditions of interest. Data will be analysed using categorical data analysis and multinomial logistic regression.\nNo ethical approval is required for this study. Results will be presented at relevant scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed literature.", "Circadian rhythms play an important role in biological function; their expression differs across individuals; three chronotypes are distinguished: Morning- [MT], Evening- [ET], and Neither- [NT] type. MT achieve peak activation in the first part of the day and are generally more conscientious and achievement-oriented than ET, which reach their best during the second half of the day and express a higher intelligence. University class schedules can sometimes conflict with ET circadian preferences, compromising their academic performance compared with their MT classmates. Conversely, MT students, being more aligned with their daily schedule, might be more advantaged in their mental performance. The attitudes and performance of NT students are little considered. No studies to date have investigated academic achievement in relation to chronotype in an Italian student population. To fill this gap, this study examined the relationship between chronotype and academic performance in a population of Motor Science Faculty in Milan, differentiating achievement in theoretical and practical subjects by chronotype. The study population was 423 university students (290 males and 133 females) and categorized by chronotype according to Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) scores. Student transcripts were reviewed to obtain exam grades on three practical and three theoretical subjects. The interaction between MEQ score or chronotypes and mean exam grade was evaluated using one-way ANOVA. The mean grades on the theoretical and practical exams were higher for the MT than for either the ET or the NT students. The NT students (24.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1) had lower mean grades for the theoretical subjects than either the MT (26.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4) or the ET (25.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2) students, while the ET (26.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2) performed worse than either the MT (27.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2) or the NT students (26.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1) on the practical exams. The same trend was observed for the total sample and when subdivided by sex. In the total sample, significant differences in theoretical and practical exam grades were noted between chronotypes: MT vs ET (p <\u00a0.002, p <\u00a0.0006) and MT vs NT (p <\u00a0.04, p <\u00a0.003). The differences between the males were significant for the theoretical (p <\u00a0.006, MT vs NT, p <\u00a0.002) and the practical subjects (MT vs ET p <\u00a0.004, MT vs NT, p <\u00a0.01), but no significant differences were noted between the females. Our findings indicate overall better academic achievement by the MT students, whereas the NT had lower exam grades for the theoretical subjects and the ET performed worse on the practical exams. We speculate that the higher intelligence expressed by the ET students might have helped them compensate the disadvantage on the theoretical but not on practical exams, in which the effect of misalignment between circadian preferences and university class schedule was more evident.", "Neutron fluence and neutron ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), are important physical quantities for neutron radiation protection and monitoring. They can be deduced from neutron spectrum, which is usually measured by multisphere system with proper unfolding methods. Novel unfolding methods on the basis of artificial intelligence, mainly artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been researched and developed. However, without normalization on network inputs, ANNs can not be applied to accommodate demands of various neutron field measurements for neutron spectrum unfolding in practice, because the neutron spectra for training the ANNs are mostly extracted from IAEA (2001), the integrals of which over neutron energy are unit fluences. Moreover, derived from an unfolded normalized spectrum, the true values of neutron fluence and H*(10) are never to know. In this work, three normalization methods-zero-mean normalization method, min-max normalization method, and maximum-divided normalization method were used to process with the inputs of generalized regression neural networks (GRNNs), and a new method was proposed for neutron fluence and H*(10) estimations derived from unfolded neutron spectrum based on GRNNs for the first time. Sixty-three neutron spectra were unfolded based on GRNNs with use of three normalization methods, and the corresponding neutron fluences and H*(10) were obtained and compared. From the testing results, the GRNNs with the maximum-divided method is most effective to unfold neutron spectrum and to evaluate neutron fluence and H*(10). The feasibility of the method was further studied through experiments by using Bonner sphere spectrometer in well characterized 241Am-Be neutron field.", "Phenomenon: Virtual standardized patients (vSPs) are becoming increasingly common in medical education, though one limitation of vSPs is the artificiality of computer-based simulators. Past research on the use of vSPs has not clearly established whether learners have different emotional responses to real SPs (rSPs) compared with vSPs; however, understanding learners' emotional responses to vSPs is important in providing realistic learning experiences and establishing the validity of this teaching and assessment tool. This study compared the emotional experiences of individuals who interacted with rSPs and vSPs. Approach: Sixty medical students at a medical school in the southeastern United States participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to deliver bad news to an rSP or vSP. The vSP for this study used a hybrid intelligence model that allowed a person to \"inhabit\" the vSP. Salivary cortisol and a self-report measure of mood-the Profile of Mood States, Second Edition (POMS 2)-were gathered before and after delivering the bad news. The SP and 2 independent evaluators rated the behavioral performance of each participant in real and virtual conditions. Participants also rated the performance of the SP. Findings: Participants in both conditions reported increased negative emotionality on the POMS 2 following the SP interaction. There were no significant between-group differences on the POMS 2 or salivary cortisol concentration following the SP interaction. Ratings by the SP and independent evaluators indicated that participants performed similarly on most interpersonal dimensions, except tone of voice. Participants perceived the vSP as less realistic than the rSP. Insights: These results suggest that medical students may have similar emotional and behavioral responses when delivering bad news to a vSP when compared to an rSP. These findings provide support for the continued use of vSPs in training learners to deliver bad news and other communication-based skills and to assess their performance on these tasks.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad transdisciplinary field with roots in logic, statistics, cognitive psychology, decision theory, neuroscience, linguistics, cybernetics, and computer engineering. The modern field of AI began at a small summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. Since then, AI applications made possible by machine learning (ML), an AI subdiscipline, include Internet searches, e-commerce sites, goods and services recommender systems, image and speech recognition, sensor technologies, robotic devices, and cognitive decision support systems (DSSs). As more applications are integrated into everyday life, AI is predicted to have a globally transformative influence on economic and social structures similar to the effect that other general-purpose technologies, such as steam engines, railroads, electricity, electronics, and the Internet, have had. Novel AI applications in the workplace of the future raise important issues for occupational safety and health. This commentary reviews the origins of AI, use of ML methods, and emerging AI applications embedded in physical objects like sensor technologies, robotic devices, or operationalized in intelligent DSSs. Selected implications on the future of work arising from the use of AI applications, including job displacement from automation and management of human-machine interactions, are also reviewed. Engaging in strategic foresight about AI workplace applications will shift occupational research and practice from a reactive posture to a proactive one. Understanding the possibilities and challenges of AI for the future of work will help mitigate\u00a0the unfavorable effects of AI on worker safety, health, and well-being.", "To test the feasibility of a fully automated artificial intelligence-based method providing PET measures of prostate cancer (PCa).\nA convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained for automated measurements in 18 F-choline (FCH) PET/CT scans obtained prior to radical prostatectomy (RP) in 45 patients with newly diagnosed PCa. Automated values were obtained for prostate volume, maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax ), mean standardized uptake value of voxels considered abnormal (SUVmean ) and volume of abnormal voxels (Volabn ). The product SUVmean \u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Volabn was calculated to reflect total lesion uptake (TLU). Corresponding manual measurements were performed. CNN-estimated data were compared with the weighted surgically removed tissue specimens and manually derived data and related to clinical parameters assuming that 1\u00a0g\u00a0\u2248\u00a01\u00a0ml of tissue.\nThe mean (range) weight of the prostate specimens was 44\u00a0g (20-109), while CNN-estimated volume was 62\u00a0ml (31-108) with a mean difference of 13\u00b75\u00a0g or ml (95% CI: 9\u00b778-17\u00b732). The two measures were significantly correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b777, P<0\u00b7001). Mean differences (95% CI) between CNN-based and manually derived PET measures of SUVmax, SUVmean, Volabn (ml) and TLU were 0\u00b737 (-0\u00b701 to 0\u00b775), -0\u00b708 (-0\u00b730 to 0\u00b714), 1\u00b740 (-2\u00b726 to 5\u00b706) and 9\u00b761 (-3\u00b795 to 23\u00b717), respectively. PET findings Volabn and TLU correlated with PSA (P<0\u00b705), but not with Gleason score or stage.\nAutomated CNN segmentation provided in seconds volume and simple PET measures similar to manually derived ones. Further studies on automated CNN segmentation with newer tracers such as radiolabelled prostate-specific membrane antigen are warranted.", "Machine learning (ML) algorithms have found increasing utility in the medical imaging field and numerous applications in the analysis of digital biomarkers within positron emission tomography (PET) imaging have emerged. Interest in the use of artificial intelligence in PET imaging for the study of neurodegenerative diseases and oncology stems from the potential for such techniques to streamline decision support for physicians providing early and accurate diagnosis and allowing personalized treatment regimens. In this review, the use of ML to improve PET image acquisition and reconstruction is presented, along with an overview of its applications in the analysis of PET images for the study of Alzheimer's disease and oncology.", "Girls with pathogenic variants in FMR1, the gene responsible for Fragile X syndrome, have received relatively little attention in the literature. The reports of girls with trinucleotide expansions or deletions affecting FMR1 describe variable phenotypes; having normal intelligence and no severe neurologic sequelae is not uncommon. We reviewed epilepsy genetics research databases for girls with FMR1 pathogenic variants and seizures to characterize the spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes. We identified 4 patients, 3 of whom had drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Two had severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with late-onset epileptic spasms. Our findings demonstrate that FMR1 loss-of-function variants can result in severe neurologic phenotypes in girls. Similar cases may be missed because clinicians may not always perform Fragile X testing in girls, particularly those with severe neurodevelopmental impairment or late-onset spasms.", "The effect of exotropia on the intelligence of children is unknown. This study aimed to assess the intelligence in children with exotropia and investigate the influence of the main clinical indexes of strabismus on intelligence. Eighty-four participants aged 8-12 years were enrolled, including 37 patients with exotropia (exotropia group) and 47 normal individuals (normal group). Intelligence was assessed by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), including the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), Working Memory Index (WMI), Processing Speed Index (PSI), and Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ). The exotropia group had a significantly lower PRI score but a higher PSI score than the normal group. However, there was no significant difference in the WMI, VCI, and FSIQ between groups. Multiple linear regression showed that PRI-WMI and PRI-PSI differences were significantly lower in the exotropia group. Inter-subscale correlations analysis showed that the pattern of intelligence structure was different between groups. The type of exotropia, angle of deviation, duration of symptoms, and stereoacuity had no effect on the intelligence of children with exotropia. Children with exotropia had a relatively worse performance in the perceptual reasoning skill but a better processing speed and a different pattern of intelligence structure.", "The Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Infrastructure for Clinical Intelligence (DaVINCI) creates an electronic network between the two United States federal agencies that provides a consolidated view of electronic medical record data for both service members and Veterans. This inter-agency collaboration has created new opportunities for supporting transitions in clinical care, reporting to Congress, and longitudinal research.", "Recent research revealed the superiority of artificial intelligence over dermatologists to diagnose melanoma from images. However, 30-50% of all melanomas and more than half of those in young patients evolve from initially benign lesions. Despite its high relevance for melanoma screening, neither clinicians nor computers are yet able to reliably predict a nevus' oncologic transformation. The cause of this lies in the static nature of lesion presentation in the current standard of care, both for clinicians and algorithms. The status quo makes it difficult to train algorithms (and clinicians) to precisely assess the likelihood of a benign skin lesion to transform into melanoma. In addition, it inhibits the precision of current algorithms since 'evolution' image features may not be part of their decision. The current literature reveals certain types of melanocytic nevi (i.e. 'spitzoid' or 'dysplastic' nevi) and criteria (i.e. visible vasculature) that, in general, appear to have a higher chance to transform into melanoma. However, owing to the cumulative nature of oncogenic mutations in melanoma, a more fine-grained early morphologic footprint is likely to be detectable by an algorithm. In this perspective article, the concept of melanoma prediction is further explored by the discussion of the evolution of melanoma, the concept for training of such a nevi classifier and the implications of early melanoma prediction for clinical practice. In conclusion, the authors believe that artificial intelligence trained on prospective image data could be transformative for skin cancer diagnostics by (a) predicting melanoma before it occurs (i.e. pre-in situ) and (b) further enhancing the accuracy of current melanoma classifiers. Necessary prospective images for this research are obtained via free mole-monitoring mobile apps.", "The recent wave of data on exoplanets lends support to METI ventures (Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), insofar as the more exoplanets we find, the more likely it is that \"exominds\" await our messages. Yet, despite these astronomical advances, there are presently no well-confirmed tests against which to check the design of interstellar messages. In the meantime, the best we can do is distance ourselves from terracentric assumptions. There is no reason, for example, to assume that all inferential abilities are language-like. With that in mind, I argue that logical reasoning does not have to be couched in symbolic notation. In diagrammatic reasoning, inferences are underwritten, not by rules, but by transformations of self-same qualitative signs. I use the Existential Graphs of C. S. Peirce to show this. Since diagrams are less dependent on convention and might even be generalized to cover non-visual senses, I argue that METI researchers should add some form of diagrammatic representations to their repertoire. Doing so can shed light, not just on alien minds, but on the deepest structures of reasoning itself.", "Organic electrosynthesis can transform the chemical industry by introducing electricity-driven processes that are more energy efficient and that can be easily integrated with renewable energy sources. However, their deployment is severely hindered by the difficulties of controlling selectivity and achieving a large energy conversion efficiency at high current density due to the low solubility of organic reactants in practical electrolytes. This control can be improved by carefully balancing the mass transport processes and electrocatalytic reaction rates at the electrode diffusion layer through pulsed electrochemical methods. In this study, we explore these methods in the context of the electrosynthesis of adiponitrile (ADN), the largest organic electrochemical process in industry. Systematically exploring voltage pulses in the timescale between 5 and 150 ms led to a 20% increase in production of ADN and a 250% increase in relative selectivity with respect to the state-of-the-art constant voltage process. Moreover, combining this systematic experimental investigation with artificial intelligence (AI) tools allowed us to rapidly discover drastically improved electrosynthetic conditions, reaching improvements of 30 and 325% in ADN production rates and selectivity, respectively. This powerful AI-enhanced experimental approach represents a paradigm shift in the design of electrified chemical transformations, which can accelerate the deployment of more sustainable electrochemical manufacturing processes.", "Research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the endoscopic evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract is novel. Since colonoscopy and detection of polyps can decrease the risk of colon cancer, it is recommended by multiple national and international societies. However, the procedure of colonoscopy is performed by humans where there are significant interoperator and interpatient variations, and hence, the risk of missing detection of adenomatous polyps. Early studies involving CAD and AI for the detection and differentiation of polyps show great promise. In this appraisal, we review existing scientific aspects of AI in CAD of colon polyps and discuss the pitfalls and future directions for advancing the science. This review addresses the technical intricacies in a manner that physicians can comprehend to promote a better understanding of this novel application.", "This study aimed to develop a classification scheme for retrieving information from incident reports of medication errors. This 15-category classification scheme captures minimal medication-incident related information from incident reports and thus serves as an information model for automatic information retrieval solution. The automatic solution uses recent advances in artificial intelligence methods to learn from incident report resources and is promising to the prevention of adverse drug events and promotion of safety in medical care.", "Computer-aided diagnosis based on computed tomography (CT) image can realize the detection and classification of pulmonary nodules, and improve the survival rate of early lung cancer, which has important clinical significance. In recent years, with the rapid development of medical big data and artificial intelligence technology, the auxiliary diagnosis of lung cancer based on deep learning has gradually become one of the most active research directions in this field. In order to promote the deep learning in the detection and classification of pulmonary nodules, we reviewed the research progress in this field based on the relevant literatures published at domestic and overseas in recent years. This paper begins with a brief introduction of two widely used lung CT image databases: lung image database consortium and image database resource initiative (LIDC-IDRI) and Data Science Bowl 2017. Then, the detection and classification of pulmonary nodules based on different network structures are introduced in detail. Finally, some problems of deep learning in lung CT image nodule detection and classification are discussed and conclusions are given. The development prospect is also forecasted, which provides reference for future application research in this field.\n\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\uff08CT\uff09\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u65e9\u671f\u80ba\u764c\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u533b\u7597\u5927\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u98de\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u80ba\u764c\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u5df2\u9010\u6e10\u6210\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u6700\u4e3a\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd1\u5e74\u56fd\u5185\u5916\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u5bf9\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u7b80\u8981\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e24\u5927\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u80ba CT \u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff1a\u80ba\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8054\u76df\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8d44\u6e90\u8ba1\u5212\uff08LIDC-IDRI\uff09\u548c 2017 \u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u676f\uff08Data Science Bowl 2017\uff09\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u4ecb\u7ecd\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53d1\u5c55\u524d\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5c55\u671b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eca\u540e\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002.", "In a preschool through first grade longitudinal study, we identified groups of children with persistently low mathematics achievement (n\u202f=\u202f14) and children with low achievement in preschool but average achievement in first grade (n\u202f=\u202f23). The preschool quantitative developments of these respective groups of children with mathematical learning disability (MLD) and recovered children and a group of typically achieving peers (n\u202f=\u202f35) were contrasted, as were their intelligence, executive function, and parental education levels. The core characteristics of the children with MLD were poor executive function and delayed understanding of the cardinal value of number words throughout preschool. These compounded into even more substantive deficits in number and arithmetic at the beginning of first grade. The recovered group had poor executive function and cardinal knowledge during the first year of preschool but showed significant gains during the second year. Despite these gains and average mathematics achievement, the recovered children had subtle deficits with accessing magnitudes associated with numerals and addition combinations (e.g., 5\u202f+\u202f6 = ?) in first grade. The study provides unique insight into domain-general and quantitative deficits in preschool that increase risk for long-term mathematical difficulties.", "This paper explores the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) on the management of healthcare data and information and how AI technologies will affect the responsibilities and work of health information management (HIM) professionals.\nA literature review was conducted of both peer-reviewed literature and published opinions on current and future use of AI technology to collect, store, and use healthcare data. The authors also sought insights from key HIM leaders via semi-structured interviews conducted both on the phone and by email.\nThe following HIM practices are impacted by AI technologies: 1) Automated medical coding and capturing AI-based information; 2) Healthcare data management and data governance; 3) Fbtient privacy and confidentiality; and 4) HIM workforce training and education.\nHIM professionals must focus on improving the quality of coded data that is being used to develop AI applications. HIM professional's ability to identify data patterns will be an important skill as automation advances, though additional skills in data analysis tools and techniques are needed. In addition, HIM professionals should consider how current patient privacy practices apply to AI application, development, and use.\nAI technology will continue to evolve as will the role of HIM professionals who are in a unique position to take on emerging roles with their depth of knowledge on the sources and origins of healthcare data. The challenge for HIM professionals is to identify leading practices for the management of healthcare data and information in an AI-enabled world.", "A generally intelligent agent faces a dilemma: it requires a complex sensorimotor space to be capable of solving a wide range of problems, but many tasks are only feasible given the right problem-specific formulation. I argue that a necessary but understudied requirement for general intelligence is the ability to form task-specific abstract representations. I show that the reinforcement learning paradigm structures this question into how to learn action abstractions and how to learn state abstractions, and discuss the field's progress on these topics.", "Researchers continue to debate the constructs measured by commercial ability tests. Factor analytic investigations of these measures have been used to develop and refine widely adopted psychometric theories of intelligence particularly the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model. Even so, this linkage may be problematic as many of these investigations examine a particular instrument in isolation and CHC model specification across tests and research teams has not been consistent. To address these concerns, the present study used Monte Carlo resampling to investigate the latent structure of four of the most widely used intelligence tests for children and adolescents. The results located the approximate existence of the publisher posited CHC theoretical group factors in the Differential Abilities Scales-Second edition and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-Second edition but not in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth edition or the Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Cognitive Abilities. Instead, the results supported alternative conceptualizations from independent factor analytic research. Additionally, whereas a bifactor model produced superior fit indices in two instruments (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth edition and Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Cognitive Abilities), a higher order structure was found to be superior in the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-Second edition and the Differential Abilities Scales-Second edition. Regardless of the model employed, the general factor captured a significant portion of each instrument's variance. Implications for IQ test assessment, interpretation, and theory are discussed.", "Grit, resilience and a growth mindset are personal traits conducive to optimal learning and clinical readiness. These are important traits to consider with regards to whether a student thrives or struggles in challenging situations. Research with medical, nursing and pharmacy students demonstrates correlations of these traits with positive well-being and academic success. No research has investigated the traits of resilience, grit and mindset type together in health professional students to explore whether they are related, and none have focused on physiotherapy students.\nCross-sectional study of final-year physiotherapy students (n\u00a0=\u00a0134) aiming to describe the levels of these personal traits and to determine whether they are related to each other or demographic factors.\nA proportion of physiotherapy students have low levels of resilience (25%), low academic resilience (19%) and low levels of grittiness (13%). Grit and resilience were positively related (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A smaller fraction of students had a fixed mindset in relation to intelligence (7%) and talent (10%). Having a mental health condition or disability and the number of hours spent in paid employment were related to personal traits.\nThis is the first study to document empirical evidence of physiotherapy students' levels of grit, resilience and mindset type with a significant proportion of students having low levels of these attributes. Results have implications for clinical educators and universities seeking to improve student well-being in order to facilitate effective learning. Institutions need to consider best-practice approaches to managing and supporting these students to foster well-being for effective learning.", "Perception of emotions and adequate responses are key factors of a successful conversational agent. However, determining emotions in a healthcare setting depends on multiple factors such as context and medical condition. Given the increase of interest in conversational agents integrated in mobile health applications, our objective in this work is to introduce a concept for analyzing emotions and sentiments expressed by a person in a mobile health application with a conversational user interface. The approach bases upon bot technology (Synthetic intelligence markup language) and deep learning for emotion analysis. More specifically, expressions referring to sentiments or emotions are classified along seven categories and three stages of strengths using treebank annotation and recursive neural networks. The classification result is used by the chatbot for selecting an appropriate response. In this way, the concerns of a user can be better addressed. We describe three use cases where the approach could be integrated to make the chatbot emotion-sensitive.", "Numerous studies have confirmed robust relationships between general well-being and mindfulness or character strengths, respectively, but few have examined associations between mindfulness and character strengths. Two studies were carried out to explore these relationships comprehensively in the framework of the Values in Action (VIA) classification of character strengths.\nIn study 1, participants (N\u2009=\u20091335) completed validated assessments of mindfulness and character strengths, and the relationship between the two was investigated in a broad online sample. In study 2, the effect of a mindfulness training on specific character strengths was investigated using a randomized-control design (N\u2009=\u200942).\nThe results of study 1 confirmed positive relationships between mindfulness and character strengths and further identified a list of character strengths that might overlap with mindfulness-i.e., creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective, bravery, perseverance, zest, love, social intelligence, forgiveness, self-regulation, appreciation of beauty, gratitude, hope, and spirituality. The findings of study 2 provided further support for the hypothesis that mindfulness training could help cultivate certain character strengths. Compared with participants in the waitlist control condition, those who attended an 8-week mindfulness-based training program showed significant increases in the strengths of love, appreciation of beauty, gratitude, and spirituality, and a trend toward significant increases in the strengths of zest and bravery.\nThe results provide initial evidence for a mutual support model of mindfulness and character strengths.", "Structuring raw medical documents with ontology mapping is now the next step for medical intelligence. Deep learning models take as input mathematically embedded information, such as encoded texts. To do so, word embedding methods can represent every word from a text as a fixed-length vector. A formal evaluation of three word embedding methods has been performed on raw medical documents. The data corresponds to more than 12M diverse documents produced in the Rouen hospital (drug prescriptions, discharge and surgery summaries, inter-services letters, etc.). Automatic and manual validation demonstrates that Word2Vec based on the skip-gram architecture had the best rate on three out of four accuracy tests.

Electrode contacts (ECs) were scored as ESM+ if ESM interfered with speech/language function. For each patient, presurgical MRI was transformed to a standard space and coregistered with computed tomographic (CT) scan to obtain EC locations. After whole-brain parcellation, this fused image data were intersected with three-dimensional language fMRI (Neurosynth), and each EC was classified as lying within/outside the fMRI language parcel. Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and other indices were estimated. Current thresholds for language inhibition and after-discharges (ADs) were analyzed using multivariable linear mixed models.\nIn 10 patients (5 females), aged 5.4-21.2\u202fyears, speech/language inhibition was noted with ESM on 87/304 (29%) ECs. Stereo-EEG language ESM was a valid classifier of fMRI (Neurosynth) language sites (DOR: 9.02, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), with high specificity (0.87) but poor sensitivity (0.57). Similar diagnostic indices were seen for ECs in frontal or posterior regions, and gray or white matter. Language threshold (3.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.5\u202fmA) was lower than AD threshold (4.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.0\u202fmA, p\u202f=\u202f0.0001). Language and AD thresholds decreased with age and intelligence quotient. Electrical stimulation mapping triggered seizures/auras represented patients' habitual semiology with 1\u202fHz stimulation.\nStereo-EEG ESM can reliably identify cerebral parcels with/without language function but may under detect all language sites. We suggest a 50-Hz stimulation protocol for language ESM with stereo-EEG.", "As part of the globalization of medical education, residency programs in Oman have adopted competency-based standards by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education International (ACGME-I). Correctly perceiving the emotions of others and managing one's own emotions are essential to high-quality patient care.\nWe tested the reliability and construct validity of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF), and assessed trait Emotional Intelligence (EI) in Oman Medical Specialty Board (OMSB) residents in multiple specialties. We explored for correlations with trainees' sociodemographic background data.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional, observational study between February and August 2017. Participants were OMSB residents. We administered the TEIQue-SF and collected sociodemographic data from participants. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to identify independent predictors of trait EI.\nThe present cohort scored high in the trait EI subscale of Well-being, followed by Sociability, Self-control, and Emotionality. Among sociodemographic factors, female gender and high income were significant predictors of TEIQue-SF's Well-being subscale and high income and living in a rented home were significant predictors of the Sociability subscale.\nThis is the first study conducted among medical residents in Oman regarding trait EI and its correlates. Our findings of overall high EI and several socioeconomic predictors echo the literature on the assessment of EI in trainees. The findings add to the evidence of cross-cultural applicability of instruments to measure trait EI, and use assessments of EI in resident selection and education.", "There exists a communication gap between the biomedical informatics community on one side and the computer science/artificial intelligence community on the other side regarding the meaning of the terms \"semantic integration\" and \"knowledge representation\". This gap leads to approaches that attempt to provide one-to-one mappings between data elements and biomedical ontologies. Our aim is to clarify the representational differences between traditional data management and semantic-web-based data management by providing use cases of clinical data and clinical research data re-representation. We discuss how and why one-to-one mappings limit the advantages of using Semantic Web Technologies (SWTs).\nWe employ commonly used SWTs, such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Ontology Web Language (OWL). We reuse pre-existing ontologies and ensure shared ontological commitment by selecting ontologies from a framework that fosters community-driven collaborative ontology development for biomedicine following the same set of principles.\nWe demonstrate the results of providing SWT-compliant re-representation of data elements from two independent projects managing clinical data and clinical research data. Our results show how one-to-one mappings would hinder the exploitation of the advantages provided by using SWT.\nWe conclude that SWT-compliant re-representation is an indispensable step, if using the full potential of SWT is the goal. Rather than providing one-to-one mappings, developers should provide documentation that links data elements to graph structures to specify the re-representation.", "Liquid biopsies based on blood samples have been widely accepted as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for cancers, but extremely high sensitivity is frequently needed due to the very low levels of the specially selected DNA, RNA, or protein biomarkers that are released into blood. However, routine blood indices tests are frequently ordered by physicians, as they are easy to perform and are cost effective. In addition, machine learning is broadly accepted for its ability to decipher complicated connections between multiple sets of test data and diseases.\nThe aim of this study is to discover the potential association between lung cancer and routine blood indices and thereby help clinicians and patients to identify lung cancer based on these routine tests.\nThe machine learning method known as Random Forest was adopted to build an identification model between routine blood indices and lung cancer that would determine if they were potentially linked. Ten-fold cross-validation and further tests were utilized to evaluate the reliability of the identification model.\nIn total, 277 patients with 49 types of routine blood indices were included in this study, including 183 patients with lung cancer and 94 patients without lung cancer. Throughout the course of the study, there was correlation found between the combination of 19 types of routine blood indices and lung cancer. Lung cancer patients could be identified from other patients, especially those with tuberculosis (which usually has similar clinical symptoms to lung cancer), with a sensitivity, specificity and total accuracy of 96.3%, 94.97% and 95.7% for the cross-validation results, respectively. This identification method is called the routine blood indices model for lung cancer, and it promises to be of help as a tool for both clinicians and patients for the identification of lung cancer based on routine blood indices.\nLung cancer can be identified based on the combination of 19 types of routine blood indices, which implies that artificial intelligence can find the connections between a disease and the fundamental indices of blood, which could reduce the necessity of costly, elaborate blood test techniques for this purpose. It may also be possible that the combination of multiple indices obtained from routine blood tests may be connected to other diseases as well.", "Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is considered as an independent risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study was performed to investigate the prevalence, influencing factors and cognitive characteristics of MCI in elderly patients with T2DM in China. Methods: In the cross-sectional study, we performed cluster random sampling of 3,246 people age 60 years and older across the country. All participants were interviewed and screened for T2DM and MCI. A total of 341 subjects were diagnosed of MCI according to the criteria of Petersen, and a total of 256 subjects were diagnosed of T2DM by using the American Diabetes Association criteria Among the 256 T2DM people, 56 were also diagnosed with MCI. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate risk and protective factor for MCI with T2DM. We also assessed their cognitive function by using the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Digit span, Associative Learning Test (ALT), Visual Identification Test (VIT), Verbal Fluency (VF), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III Block Design, WAIS-III picture completion and Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT). Results: Among the 256 T2DM patients, 56 were diagnosed with MCI, and the prevalence of MCI in T2DM was 21.8%. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that depression (p = 0.002, OR = 6.220, 95% CI: 2.005-19.290) was a risk factor for MCI among T2DM patients, while education (p < 0.001, OR = 0.869, 95% CI: 0.805-0.983) was a protective one. All the scores of neuropsychological tests (except for MMSE) in T2DM patients with MCI were lower than those without MCI (p < 0.05), but there was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) in neuropsychological tests between T2DM-MCI group and No-T2DM-MCI group. Linear regression analysis showed that the drug treatment of diabetes was positively correlated (t = 2.263, p = 0.025) with the total score of auditory word tests. Conclusions: The present study suggests a high prevalence of MCI among Chinese T2DM patients. Depression is a risk factor for MCI, while education is a protective one. T2DM patients with MCI often show comprehensive cognitive impairment, and the drug treatment of diabetes might help to improve cognitive function.", "Tools for medical image analysis have been developed to reduce the time needed to detect abnormalities and to provide more accurate results. Particularly, tools based on artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have led to significant improvements in medical imaging interpretation in the last decade. Automatic evaluation of acute ischemic stroke in medical imaging is one of the fields that witnessed a major development. Commercially available products so far aim to identify (and quantify) the ischemic core, the ischemic penumbra, the site of arterial occlusion and the collateral flow but they are not (yet) intended as standalone diagnostic tools. Their use can be complementary; they are intended to support physicians' interpretation of medical images and hence standardise selection of patients for acute treatment. This review provides an introduction into the field of computer-aided diagnosis and focuses on the automatic analysis of non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography, computed tomography angiography and perfusion imaging. Future studies are necessary that allow the evaluation and comparison of different imaging strategies and post-processing algorithms during the diagnosis process in patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke; which may further facilitate the standardisation of treatment and stroke management.", "PQ Birch represents an allergen-specific immunotherapy for the treatment of birch pollinosis. It consists of native birch pollen extract chemically modified with glutaldehyde adsorbed to L-tyrosine in its microcrystalline form with addition of the adjuvant Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL\u00ae). A nonclinical safety testing strategy was designed based upon interpretation of current legislation and regulatory intelligence and comprised genotoxicity studies (bacterial reverse mutation and Chinese hamster ovary micronucleus assays), a rat repeat dose toxicology study and a rabbit local tolerance study. No safety findings of concern were found. Thus, no evidence of genotoxicity was found. Relatively minor, immunostimulatory effects were seen following repeated subcutaneous dosing (once every 2 weeks for 13 weeks) as reversible increased white cell count (notably neutrophils), increased globulin level (resulting in decreased albumin/globulin [A/G] ratio) and increased fibrinogen, as well as minor dose site reaction in the form of inflammatory cell infiltrate. These findings are likely due to the immunostimulatory nature of MPL\u00ae and/or the presence of L-tyrosine within the adjuvanted vaccine. Similar dose site inflammatory changes to the injected formulation were also noted in the rabbit local tolerance study.", "This survey aims at reviewing the literature related to Clinical Information Systems (CIS), Hospital Information Systems (HIS), Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, and how collected data can be analyzed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.\nWe selected the major journals (11 journals) collecting papers (more than 7,000) over the last five years from the top members of the research community, and read and analyzed the papers (more than 200) covering the topics. Then, we completed the analysis using search engines to also include papers from major conferences over the same five years.\nWe defined a taxonomy of major features and research areas of CIS, HIS, EHR systems. We also defined a taxonomy for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques on healthcare data. In the light of these taxonomies, we report on the most relevant papers from the literature.\nWe highlighted some major research directions and issues which seem to be promising and to need further investigations over a medium- or long-term period.", "Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a method of choice for image recognition. Herein a hybrid CNN approach is presented for molecular pattern recognition in drug discovery. Using self-organizing map images of molecular pharmacophores as input, CNN models were trained to identify chemokine receptor CXCR4 modulators with high accuracy. This machine learning classifier identified first-in-class synthetic CXCR4 full agonists. The receptor-activating effects were confirmed by intracellular cAMP response and in a phenotypic spheroid invasion assay of medulloblastoma cell invasion. Additional macromolecular targets of the small molecules were predicted in\u2005silico and tested in\u2005vitro, revealing modulatory effects on dopamine receptors and CCR1. These results positively advocate the applicability of molecular image recognition by CNNs to ligand-based virtual compound screening, and demonstrate the complementarity of machine intelligence and human expert knowledge.", "Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a critical choice for applications of point-of-care testing (POCT) in clinical and laboratory environments because of its excellent features and versatility. To obtain authentic values of analyte concentrations and reliable detection results, the relevant research has featured the application of a diversity of methods of mathematical analysis to technical analysis to allow for use with a small quantity of data. Accordingly, a number of signal and image processing strategies have also emerged for the application of gold immunochromatographic and fluorescent strips to improve sensitivity and overcome the limitations of correlative hardware systems. Instead of traditional methods to solve the problem, researchers nowadays are interested in machine learning and its more powerful variant, deep learning technology, for LFIA detection. This review emphasizes different models for the POCT of accurate labels as well as signal processing strategies that use artificial intelligence and machine learning. We focus on the analytical mechanism, procedural flow, and the results of the assay, and conclude by summarizing the advantages and limitations of each algorithm. We also discuss the potential for application of and directions of future research on LFIA technology when combined with Artificial Intelligence and deep learning.", "The dental graduation program is stressful and challenging as it is essential to master various skills. The emotional intelligence (EI) is reported to help in perceiving, moderating emotions and also play a significant role in academic excellence.\nThe aim of this study was to assess the sociodemographic factors influencing EI and to determine the association of EI in academic performance of clinical and preclinical courses.\nThis cross-sectional study included the 113 dental clinical internship students from five different dental schools at Pakistan. The self-administered questionnaire data included sociodemographic factors, academic performance in preclinical, clinical courses, and San Diego City College MESA Program-based EI responses. The results were analyzed with multiple linear regression and ordinal regression to identify the independent predictor for EI and academic performance.\nThe female participants had marginally higher mean EI score (109.67) in comparison to male counterparts (108.10). The independent predictors among sociodemographic factors for EI were having siblings (P = 0.016), loss of parents (P = 0.002), parents' education (P = 0.022), and relation with parents (P = 0.03). The students enjoy studying dentistry were also associated with higher EI scores (P = 0.002). The mean EI score was an independent predictor of academic performance predominantly in clinical courses [\u03b2 = -0.041 (95% confidence interval - 0.063 to - 0.020); P = 0.000].\nThe finding of the study indicates the influence of family and social factors in the development of EI. The dental students' EI is vital for higher academic performance in clinical courses.", "The Brazilian Savannah, known as Cerrado, has the richest flora in the world among the savannas, with a high degree of endemic species. Despite the global ecological importance of the Cerrado, there are few studies focused on the modeling of the volume and biomass of this forest formation. Volume and biomass estimation can be performed using allometric models, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and mixed regression models. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the use of AI techniques and mixed models to estimate the volume and biomass of individual trees in vegetation of Brazilian central savanna. Numerical variables (diameter at height of 1.30\u202fm of ground, total height, volume and biomass) and categorical variables (species) were used for the training and fitting of AI techniques and mixed models, respectively. The statistical indicators used to evaluate the training and the adjustment were the correlation coefficient, bias and Root mean square error relative. In addition, graphs were elaborated as complementary analysis. The results obtained by the statistical indicators and the graphical analysis show the great potential of AI techniques and mixed models in the estimation of volume and biomass of individual trees in Brazilian savanna vegetation. In addition, the proposed methodologies can be adapted to other biomes, forest typologies and variables of interest.", "Policymakers require a systematic approach when planning for information technology needs in healthcare.\nThe aim of this study was to obtain experts' predictions of future health information technology (HIT) needs until 2025 for Iran in relation to the relative importance of key technologies, expected timeframe of realisation, areas that may be impacted upon and obstacles to achieving these goals.\nThis article presents results from the third phase (a Delphi study) of a larger mixed-method study. Policymakers from the Iranian Ministry of Health and faculty members from different medical universities across the country who were expert in the field of HIT were invited to participate (n = 61).\nParticipants (39) completed the first-round questionnaire and 24 completed the second. The development of personal health records (n = 32, 82.0%), the development of clinical decision-making systems (n = 30, 76.9%) and the use of business intelligence for collecting and analysing clinical and financial data (n = 32, 82.0%) were predicted to occur after 2025. The healthcare areas predicted to experience the greatest impact from most HITs were facilitating patient-provider communication and improving healthcare quality. Key barriers to achieving HITs were related to weaknesses in planning and limited financial resources for most technologies.\nBy identifying the areas of impact and the barriers to achieving the HIT goals, more accurate planning is possible and resources can be allocated according to priorities.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) in nuclear medicine and radiology represents a significant disruptive technology. Although there has been much debate about the impact of AI on the careers of radiologists, the opportunities in nuclear medicine enhance the capability of the physician and at the same time have an impact on the responsibilities of physicists and technologists. This transformative technology requires insight into the principles and opportunities for seamless assimilation into practice without the associated displacement of human resources. This article introduces the current clinical applications of machine learning and deep learning.", "To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2018.\nA bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting of the editorial team was organized to conclude on the selection of best papers.\nAmong the 1,469 retrieved papers published in 2018 in the various areas of CRI, the full review process selected four best papers. The first best paper describes a simple algorithm detecting co-morbidities in Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) using a clinical data warehouse and a knowledge base. The authors of the second best paper present a federated algorithm for predicting heart failure hospital admissions based on patients' medical history described in their distributed EHRs. The third best paper reports the evaluation of an open source, interoperable, and scalable data quality assessment tool measuring completeness of data items, which can be run on different architectures (EHRs and Clinical Data Warehouses (CDWs) based on PCORnet or OMOP data models). The fourth best paper reports a data quality program conducted across 37 hospitals addressing data quality Issues through the whole data life cycle from patient to researcher.\nResearch efforts in the CRI field currently focus on consolidating promises of early Distributed Research Networks aimed at maximizing the potential of large-scale, harmonized data from diverse, quickly developing digital sources. Data quality assessment methods and tools as well as privacy-enhancing techniques are major concerns. It is also notable that, following examples in the US and Asia, ambitious regional or national plans in Europe are launched that aim at developing big data and new artificial intelligence technologies to contribute to the understanding of health and diseases in whole populations and whole health systems, and returning actionable feedback loops to improve existing models of research and care. The use of \"real-world\" data is continuously increasing but the ultimate role of this data in clinical research remains to be determined.", "This study assessed predictors of successful selection in the very challenging and stressful United States Army Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS) course among 800 Soldiers. A battery of measures were collected during the course and their ability to predict selection were assessed using logistic regression and chi-square tests. Physical performance measures were most predictive, including road march times, land navigation coordinates found, run times, fitness test score, obstacle course score, and pull-ups (p\u202f<\u202f.05). Soldiers that were officers or 18\u00d7 enlisted (fast-tracked to SFAS), had <1\u202fyear of active duty,\u202f\u2265\u202fbachelor degree, no children, were not married, and were Ranger school graduates were more likely to be selected (p\u202f<\u202f.05). Several psychological measures were predictive, including intelligence quotient, grade level equivalents, resilience score, military aptitude score, and grit (p\u202f<\u202f.05). Basal serum physiological markers weakly predicted selection and were weakly associated with behavioral assessments. Lower C-reactive protein (< 9.5\u202fnmol/L) and higher cortisol and sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) predicted selection (p\u202f<\u202f.05). Higher C-reactive protein (\u2265 9.5\u202fnmol/L) was associated with lower fitness test scores and slower road march time (p\u202f<\u202f.05). Cortisol was correlated with higher grit and resilience scores (p\u202f<\u202f.05). SHBG correlated with higher grade level equivalents and better performance on pull-ups, land navigation, obstacle course, and the fitness test (p\u202f<\u202f.05). Testosterone was correlated with faster run and road march times (p\u202f<\u202f.05). Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) correlated with lower resilience scores, and DHEA-S, epinephrine, and norepinephrine correlated with worse performance on several physical events (p\u202f<\u202f.05). These findings suggest measures that could be targeted in interventions to monitor and enhance performance and resilience.", "To summarize the recent literature and research and present a selection of the best papers published in 2018 in the field of Health Information Management (HIM) and Health Informatics.\nA systematic review of the literature was performed, with the help of a medical librarian, by the two editors of the HIM section of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook. In order to include papers that would address the special theme of the 2019 Yearbook on artificial intelligence (AI) as well as HIM, we searched bibliographic databases for HIM-related papers with an AI focus using both Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors and keywords in titles and abstracts. A shortlist of 15 candidate best papers was first selected by section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers.\nWhile there were a significant number of manuscripts that addressed issues relevant to HIM, there were virtually none with MeSH headings indicating an HIM focus. Manuscripts that were considered related to the HIM field in terms of the practice of health information management as well as the profession included those that examined using machine learning and other AI approaches to identify protected health information in clinical text to aid with de-identification, automated coding approaches to translate free-text into standardized codes, and natural language processing approaches to extract clinical data to assist with populating cancer and other registries.\nThe papers discussed in the HIM section reflect the special theme of the use of AI in healthcare on issues particularly relevant to the field of HIM. This synopsis discusses these papers and recommends that HIM practitioners be more involved in research and that researchers in AI and related areas recognize the applicability and relevance of their work to the field of HIM.", "To identify research works that exemplify recent developments in the field of sensors, signals, and imaging informatics.\nA broad literature search was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science, supplemented with individual papers that were nominated by section editors. A predefined query made from a combination of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and keywords were used to search both sources. Section editors then filtered the entire set of retrieved papers with each paper having been reviewed by two section editors. Papers were assessed on a three-point Likert scale by two section editors, rated from 0 (do not include) to 2 (should be included). Only papers with a combined score of 2 or above were considered.\nA search for papers was executed at the start of January 2019, resulting in a combined set of 1,459 records published in 2018 in 119 unique journals. Section editors jointly filtered the list of candidates down to 14 nominations. The 14 candidate best papers were then ranked by a group of eight external reviewers. Four papers, representing different international groups and journals, were selected as the best papers by consensus of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook editorial board.\nThe fields of sensors, signals, and imaging informatics have rapidly evolved with the application of novel artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques. Studies have been able to discover hidden patterns and integrate different types of data towards improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. However, the quality of papers varied widely without clear reporting standards for these types of models. Nevertheless, a number of papers have demonstrated useful techniques to improve the generalizability, interpretability, and reproducibility of increasingly sophisticated models.", "The field of spine surgery has changed significantly over the past few decades as once technological fantasy has become reality. The advent of stereotaxis, intra-operative navigation, endoscopy, and percutaneous instrumentation have altered the landscape of spine surgery. The concept of minimally invasive spine (MIS) surgery has blossomed over the past ten years and now robot-assisted spine surgery is being championed by some as another potential paradigm altering technological advancement. The application of robotics in other surgical specialties has been shown to be a safe and feasible alternative to the traditional, open approach. In 2004 the Mazor Spine Assist robot was approved by FDA to assist with placement of pedicle screws and since then, more advanced robots with promising clinical outcomes have been introduced. Currently, robotic platforms are limited to pedicle screw placement. However, there are centers investigating the role of robotics in decompression, dural closure, and pre-planned osteotomies. Robot-assisted spine surgery has been shown to increase the accuracy of pedicle screw placement and decrease radiation exposure to surgeons. However, modern robotic technology also has certain disadvantages including a high introductory cost, steep learning curve, and inherent technological glitches. Currently, robotic spine surgery is in its infancy and most of the objective evidence available regarding its benefits draws from the use of robots in a shared-control model to assist with the placement of pedicle screws. As artificial intelligence software and feedback sensor design become more sophisticated, robots could facilitate other, more complex surgical tasks such as bony decompression or dural closure. The accuracy and precision afforded by the current robots available for use in spinal surgery potentially allow for even less tissue destructive and more meticulous MIS surgery. This article aims to provide a contemporary review of the use of robotics in MIS surgery.", "The microscopic assessment of tissue samples is instrumental for the diagnosis and staging of cancer, and thus guides therapy. However, these assessments demonstrate considerable variability and many regions of the world lack access to trained pathologists. Though artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve the access and quality of healthcare, the costs of image digitization in pathology and difficulties in deploying AI solutions remain as barriers to real-world use. Here we propose a cost-effective solution: the augmented reality microscope (ARM). The ARM overlays AI-based information onto the current view of the sample in real time, enabling seamless integration of AI into routine workflows. We demonstrate the utility of ARM in the detection of metastatic breast cancer and the identification of prostate cancer, with latency compatible with real-time use. We anticipate that the ARM will remove barriers towards the use of AI designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis.", "Adolescence is a unique period in which higher cognition develops to adult-level, while plasticity of neuron and behavior is at one of its peak. Notably, cognitive training studies for adolescents has been sparse and neural correlates of the training effects yet to be established. This study investigated the effects of multi-component training of cognitive control (MTCC) in order to examine whether the training enhanced adolescents' cognitive control ability and if the effects were generalizable to other cognitive domains. Cognitive control refers to the ability to adjust a series of thoughts and behaviors in correspondence to an internal goal, and involves inhibition, working memory, shifting, and dual tasking as subcomponents. The participants were middle school students (aged 11-14) and randomly assigned to either a training group or an active control group. The training group performed 30 min of MTCC per day for 6 weeks. To identify the training effects, we examined the cognitive performance, regional gray matter, and their relationship. The training group showed modest improvement in a visuospatial fluid intelligence test (Block Design) after MTCC, which was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In addition, the training effect on the gray matter volume (time \u00d7 group interaction) was observed in the right inferior cortex (rIFC). While the control group showed a typical reduction in the rIFC volume, the training group showed a relative increase in the homologous region. The relative change in rIFC volume was associated with the change in Stroop performance. These results imply that MTCC may affect brain structure relevant to inhibitory control process.", "Although infant media exposure has received attention for its implications on child development, upstream risk factors contributing to media exposure have rarely been explored. The study aim was to examine the relationship between maternal risk factors, infant television (TV) viewing, and later child cognition.\nWe used a prospective population-based birth cohort study, Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO), with 1247 pregnant mothers recruited in their first trimester. We first explored the relationship of infant TV exposure at 12\u2009months and the composite IQ score at 4.5\u2009years, as measured by the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2). Multivariable linear regressions were adjusted for maternal education, maternal mental health, child variables, birth parameters, and other relevant confounders. We then examined the associations of maternal risk factors with the amount of daily TV viewing of 12-month-old infants. Path analysis followed, to test a conceptual model designed a priori to test our hypotheses.\nThe average amount of TV viewing at 12\u2009months was 2.0\u2009h/day (SD 1.9). TV viewing in hours per day was a significant exposure variable for composite IQ (\u00df\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.55; 95% CI: -\u20092.81 to -\u20090.28) and verbal IQ (\u00df\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.77; 95% CI: -\u20093.22 to -\u20090.32) at 4.5\u2009years. Our path analysis demonstrated that lower maternal education and worse maternal mood (standardized \u00df\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.27 and 0.14, respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.01 for both variables) were both risk factors for more media exposure. This path analysis also showed that maternal mood and infant TV strongly mediated the relationship between maternal education and child cognition, with an exceptional model fit (CFI\u2009>\u20090.99, AIC 15249.82, RMSEA <\u20090.001).\nInfant TV exposure has a negative association with later cognition. Lower maternal education and suboptimal maternal mental health are risk factors for greater television viewing. Paediatricians have a role in considering and addressing early risks that may encourage television viewing.", "To present the breadth and depth of Consumer Health Informatics (CHI) initiatives and in particular, identify areas to further enhance such solutions with the incorporation of advances in artificial intelligence (AI).\nA literature review was conducted. Inclusion criteria focused on barriers and facilitators as well as key milestones for CHI over the last 10 years. In addition, significant international initiatives in regions and /or countries and opportunities to incorporate the advances of AI also made up the inclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria included factors that made reach/range of solutions to individuals or groups of individuals less than 50 people. Journals in Medline were accessed as well as the grey literature.\n200 papers were identified but this was narrowed to 25 due to repetitions and similarities of the types of solutions presented. From this, it was possible to identify key barriers and facilitators including: socio-political factors, financial factors, infrastructure, as well as levels of health literacy.\nThe relatively nascent domain of CHI has developed and is growing. Full benefits will only be realized when more precision solutions that incorporate AI advances will be designed. The example of RxPredict is provided as a case vignette to illustrate.", "This survey analyses the latest literature contributions to clinical decision support systems (DSSs) on a two-year period (2017-2018), focusing on the approaches that adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in a broad sense. The goal is to analyse the distribution of data-driven AI approaches with respect to \"classical\" knowledge-based ones, and to consider the issues raised and their possible solutions.\nWe included PubMed and Web of ScienceTM publications, focusing on contributions describing clinical DSSs that adopted one or more AI methodologies.\nWe selected 75 papers, 49 of which describe approaches in the data-driven AI area, 20 present purely knowledge-based DSSs, and 6 adopt hybrid approaches relying on both formalized knowledge and data.\nRecent studies in the clinical DSS area demonstrate a prevalence of data-driven AI, which can be adopted autonomously in purely data-driven systems, or in cooperation with domain knowledge in hybrid systems. Such hybrid approaches, able to conjugate all available knowledge sources through proper knowledge integration steps, represent an interesting example of synergy between the two AI categories. This synergy can lead to the resolution of some existing issues, such as the need for transparency and explainability, nowadays recognized as central themes to be addressed by both AI and medical informatics research.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies continue to attract interest from a broad range of disciplines in recent years, including health. The increase in computer hardware and software applications in medicine, as well as digitization of health-related data together fuel progress in the development and use of AI in medicine. This progress provides new opportunities and challenges, as well as directions for the future of AI in health.\nThe goals of this survey are to review the current state of AI in health, along with opportunities, challenges, and practical implications. This review highlights recent developments over the past five years and directions for the future.\nPublications over the past five years reporting the use of AI in health in clinical and biomedical informatics journals, as well as computer science conferences, were selected according to Google Scholar citations. Publications were then categorized into five different classes, according to the type of data analyzed.\nThe major data types identified were multi-omics, clinical, behavioral, environmental and pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) data. The current state of AI related to each data type is described, followed by associated challenges and practical implications that have emerged over the last several years. Opportunities and future directions based on these advances are discussed.\nTechnologies have enabled the development of AI-assisted approaches to healthcare. However, there remain challenges. Work is currently underway to address multi-modal data integration, balancing quantitative algorithm performance and qualitative model interpretability, protection of model security, federated learning, and model bias.", "According to a popular stereotype, women are better at multitasking than men, but empirical evidence for gender differences in multitasking performance is mixed. Previous work has focused on specific aspects of multitasking or has not considered gender differences in abilities contributing to multitasking performance. We therefore tested gender differences (N = 96, 50% female) in sequential (i.e., task switching) and concurrent (i.e., dual tasking) multitasking, while controlling for possible gender differences in working memory, processing speed, spatial abilities, and fluid intelligence. Applying two standard experimental paradigms allowed us to test multitasking abilities across five different empirical indices (i.e., performance costs) for both reaction time (RT) and accuracy measures, respectively. Multitasking resulted in substantial performance costs across all experimental conditions without a single significant gender difference in any of these ten measures, even when controlling for gender differences in underlying cognitive abilities. Thus, our results do not confirm the widespread stereotype that women are better at multitasking than men at least in the popular sequential and concurrent multitasking settings used in the present study.", "Background: Text message-based interventions have been shown to have consistently positive effects on health improvement and behavior change. Some studies suggest that personalization, tailoring, and interactivity can increase efficacy. With the rise in artificial intelligence and its incorporation into interventions, there is an opportunity to rethink how these characteristics are designed for greater effect. A key step in this process is to better understand how users engage with interventions. In this paper, we apply a text mining approach to characterize the ways that Kenyan men and women communicated with the first iterations of askNivi, a free sexual and reproductive health information service.\u00a0 Methods: We tokenized and processed more than 179,000 anonymized messages that users exchanged with live agents, enabling us to count word frequency overall, by sex, and by age/sex cohorts. We also conducted two manual coding exercises: (1) We manually classified the intent of 3,834 user messages in a training dataset; and (2) We manually coded all conversations between a random subset of 100 users who engaged in extended chats.\u00a0 Results: Between September 2017 and January 2019, 28,021 users (mean age 22.5 years, 63% female) sent 87,180 messages to askNivi, and 18 agents sent 92,429 replies. Users wrote most often about family planning methods, contraception, side effects, pregnancy, menstruation, and sex, but we observed different patterns by sex and age. User intents largely reflected the marketing focus on reproductive health, but other topics emerged. Most users sought factual information, but requests for advice and symptom reports were common.\u00a0 Conclusions: Young people in Kenya have a great desire for accurate and reliable information on health and wellbeing, which is easy to access and trustworthy. Text mining is one way to better understand how users engage with interventions like askNivi and maximize what artificial intelligence has to offer.", "Diabetes is a global public health disease projected to affect 642 million adults by 2040, with about 75% residing in low- and middle-income countries. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects 1 in 3 people with diabetes and remains the leading cause of blindness in working-aged adults. There are 3 broad strategic imperatives to prevent blindness caused by DR. Primary prevention requires preventing or delaying the onset of DR in those with diabetes by systems-level lifestyle modifications such as increasing physical activity or dietary modifications, pharmacological interventions for glycaemic and blood pressure control, and systematic screening for the onset of DR. Secondary prevention requires preventing the progression of DR in patients with DR by continuing systemic risk factor control, regular screening to monitor for the progression of mild DR to vision-threatening stages, and the development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines for managing DR. In this aspect, telemedicine-based DR screening incorporating artificial intelligence technology has the potential to facilitate more widespread and cost-effective screening, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Tertiary prevention of DR blindness has been the main focus of the clinical ophthalmology community, classically based on laser photocoagulation treatment and ocular surgery but with an increasing use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) for vision-threatening DR. Evidence from serial epidemiological studies shows blindness due to DR has declined in high-income countries (e.g., the USA and UK) due to coordinated public health education efforts, increased awareness, early detection by DR screening, sustained systemic risk factor control, and the availability of effective tertiary level treatment. However, the progress made in reducing DR blindness in high-income countries may be overwhelmed by the increasing numbers of patients with diabetes and DR in low- and middle-income countries (e.g., China, India, Indonesia, etc.). Thus, to tackle DR at a global level, a paradigm shift in strategic focus from tertiary towards secondary and primary prevention measures with a multi-pronged whole-of-society approach at regional and national levels is urgently needed.", "Assess sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of two approaches to identify patients with implantable devices that pose safety risks for MRI-an expert-derived approach and an ontology-derived natural language processing (NLP). Determine the proportion of clinical data that identify these implantable devices.\nThis Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study was performed at a 793-bed academic hospital. The expert-derived approach used an open-source software with a list of curated terms to query for implantable devices posing high safety risk (\"MRI-Red\") in patients undergoing MRI. The ontology-derived approach used an NLP system with terms mapped to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms. Queries were performed in three clinical data types-25,000 radiology reports, 174,769 emergency department (ED) notes, and 41,085 other clinical reports (eg, cardiology, operating room, physician notes, radiology reports, pathology reports, patient letters). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both methods against manual review of a randomly sampled 465 reports were assessed and tested for significant differences between expert-derived and ontology-derived approaches using t test.\nAccuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of expert-versus ontology-derived approaches were similar (0.83 versus 0.91, P\u00a0= .080; 0.88 versus 0.96, P\u00a0= .178; 0.82 versus 0.92, P\u00a0= .110). The proportion of radiology reports, ED notes, and other clinical reports retrieved containing implantable devices with high safety risks for MRI ranged from 1.47% to 1.88%.\nArtificial intelligence approaches such as expert-driven NLP and ontology-driven NLP have similar accuracy in identifying patients with implantable devices that pose high safety risks for MRI.", "Working memory impairment is one of the most troubling and persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Here we investigate how working memory deficits relate to detectable WM microstructural injuries to discover robust biomarkers that allow early identification of patients with MTBI at the highest risk of working memory impairment.\nMulti-shell diffusion MR imaging was performed on a 3T scanner with 5 b-values. Diffusion metrics of fractional anisotropy, diffusivity and kurtosis (mean, radial, axial), and WM tract integrity were calculated. Auditory-verbal working memory was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th ed, subtests: 1) Digit Span including Forward, Backward, and Sequencing; and 2) Letter-Number Sequencing. We studied 19 patients with MTBI within 4 weeks of injury and 20 healthy controls. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics and ROI analyses were performed to reveal possible correlations between diffusion metrics and working memory performance, with age and sex as covariates.\nROI analysis found a significant positive correlation between axial kurtosis and Digit Span Backward in MTBI (Pearson r = 0.69, corrected P = .04), mainly present in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus, which was not observed in healthy controls. Patients with MTBI also appeared to lose the normal associations typically seen in fractional anisotropy and axonal water fraction with Letter-Number Sequencing. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics results also support our findings.\nDifferences between patients with MTBI and healthy controls with regard to the relationship between microstructure measures and working memory performance may relate to known axonal perturbations occurring after injury.", "Technological breakthroughs occur at an ever-increasing rate thereby revolutionizing human health and wellness care. Technological advancements have drastically changed the structure and organization of the healthcare industry. McKinsey Global Institute estimates that 800 million workers worldwide could be replaced by robots by the year 2030. There is already a robotic revolution happening in healthcare wherein robots have made tasks and procedures more efficient and safer. Locsin and Ito has addressed the threat to nursing practice with human nurses being replaced by humanoid robots. Routine nursing care dictated solely by prescribed procedures and accomplishment of nursing tasks would be best performed by machines. With the future practice of nursing in a technologically advanced future transcending the implementation of nursing actions to achieve predictable outcomes, how can human nurses remain relevant as practitioners of nursing? Nurses should be involved in deciding which aspects of their practice can be delegated to technology. Nurses should oversee the introduction of automated technology and artificial intelligence ensuring their practice to be more about the universal aspects of human care continuing under a novel system. Nursing education and nursing research will change to encompass a differentiated demand for professional nursing practice with, and not for, robots in healthcare.", "Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) is a rare, recessively inherited lysosomal disease with relatively high prevalence in Finnish population. This progressive disease has a vast impact on patient's cognition and physical health, leading to intellectual disability and shorter life expectancy. Cognitive functions of 21 7- to 14-year-old children with AGU were studied cross-sectionally using Wechsler's Intelligence Scale for Children IV and the results were compared with a standardized Finnish sample. In addition to overall cognitive performance, abilities in discrete cognitive domains, including verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed, were examined. The results showed that despite the very low overall level of cognitive performance, there were notable differences between individuals. All those children whose performance was closer to their own age level were 7 to 10\u2009years old. Processing speed appeared more compromised, as compared with verbal comprehension. Furthermore, examining the subtest raw scores, there were no significant positive correlations between age and subtest scores, suggesting that the developmental level of AGU children could be rather stable throughout ages 7 to 14. This study gives insight to the severe nature of AGU disease. Since younger children performed better compared to their age norms than older children, the results raise a question whether the highest peak in cognitive functions is reached at an earlier age than previously thought.", "To provide an introduction to the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook by the editors.\nThis editorial presents an overview and introduction to the 2019 IMIA Yearbook which includes the special topic \"Artificial Intelligence in Health: New Opportunities, Challenges, and Practical Implications\". The special topic is discussed, the IMIA President's statement is introduced, and changes in the Yearbook editorial team are described.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) in Medicine arose in the 1970's from new approaches for representing expert knowledge with computers. Since then, AI in medicine has gradually evolved toward essentially data-driven approaches with great results in image analysis. However, data integration, storage, and management still present clear challenges among which the lack of explanability of the results produced by data-driven AI methods.\nWith more health data availability, and the recent developments of efficient and improved machine learning algorithms, there is a renewed interest for AI in medicine.The objective is to help health professionals improve patient care while also reduce costs. However, the other costs of AI, including ethical issues when processing personal health data by algorithms, should be included.", "Premorbid estimates of intellectual functioning are a key to assessment. This study aimed to compare 3 common measures and assess their accuracy: the Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF), Oklahoma Premorbid Intelligence Estimate (OPIE-3), and what is commonly referred to as the Barona equation. We also sought to provide appropriate adjustment considering the Flynn effect.\nThe sample consisted of a cross-section of 189 outpatient veterans receiving neuropsychological assessment including the TOPF and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th ed. (WAIS-IV). Paired sample t tests assessed differences between IQ models. Correlations for all models and actual WAIS-IV Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) to establish which model best predicted variance in current IQ. Mean differences were evaluated to establish how closely the models approximated WAIS-IV FSIQ.\nThe Barona equation estimated higher premorbid IQ than TOPF Simple Demographics Model; however, differences between the models were nonsignificant after a Flynn effect correction for the Barona equation (.23 IQ points per year). The OPIE-3 correlated with FSIQ but overestimated the FSIQ, demonstrating the Flynn effect. TOPF performance models (include word reading) characterized the variance of IQ scores best, but the Flynn-adjusted Barona equation had the smallest mean difference from the actual WAIS-IV FSIQ of any prediction model.\nDemographic models for premorbid IQ accurately estimate IQ in adult populations when normed on the test used to measure IQ, or when adjusted for the Flynn effect. A Flynn-corrected Barona score provided a more accurate estimation of WAIS-IV FSIQ than the TOPF or the OPIE-3.

All original reports published in English were analysed. A mirror literature review was also performed outside of RMDs on the same number of articles. The number of data analysed, data sources and statistical methods used (traditional statistics, AI or both) were collected. The analysis compared findings within and beyond the field of RMDs.\nOf 567 articles relating to RMDs, 55 met the inclusion criteria and were analysed, as well as 55 articles in other medical fields. The mean number of data points was 746\u2009million (range 2000-5\u2009billion) in RMDs, and 9.1\u2009billion (range 100\u2009000-200\u2009billion) outside of RMDs. Data sources were varied: in RMDs, 26 (47%) were clinical, 8 (15%) biological and 16 (29%) radiological. Both traditional and AI methods were used to analyse big data (respectively, 10 (18%) and 45 (82%) in RMDs and 8 (15%) and 47 (85%) out of RMDs). Machine learning represented 97% of AI methods in RMDs and among these methods, the most represented was artificial neural network (20/44 articles in RMDs).\nBig data sources and types are varied within the field of RMDs, and methods used to analyse big data were heterogeneous. These findings will inform a European League Against Rheumatism taskforce on big data in RMDs.", "Converging evidence has demonstrated that musical training is associated with improved perceptual and cognitive skills, including executive functions and general intelligence, particularly in childhood. In contrast, in adults the relationship between cognitive performance and musicianship is less clear and seems to be modulated by a number of background factors, such as personality and socio-economic status. Aiming to shed new light on this topic, we administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS-III), the Wechsler Memory Scale III (WMS-III), and the Stroop Test to 101 Finnish healthy adults grouped according to their musical expertise (non-musicians, amateurs, and musicians). After being matched for socio-economic status, personality traits and other demographic variables, adult musicians exhibited higher cognitive performance than non-musicians in all the mentioned measures. Moreover, linear regression models showed significant positive relationships between executive functions (working memory and attention) and the duration of musical practice, even after controlling for intelligence and background variables, such as personality traits. Hence, our study offers further support for the association between cognitive abilities and musical training, even in adulthood.\n- Musicians show higher general intelligence (FSIQ), verbal intelligence (VIQ), working memory (WMI) and attention skills than non-musicians. Amateurs score in between.- Significant positive correlations between years of musical playing and cognitive abilities support the hypothesis that long-term musical practice is associated with intelligence and executive functions.", "The combination of computational chemistry and computational materials science with machine learning and artificial intelligence provides a powerful way of relating structural features of nanomaterials with functional properties. However, combining these fundamentally different scientific approaches is not as straightforward as it seems. Machine learning methods were developed for large data sets with small numbers of consistent features. Typically nanomaterials data sets are small, with high dimensionality and high variance in the feature space, and suffer from numerous destructive biases. None of the established data science or machine learning methods in widespread use today were devised with (nano)materials data sets in mind, but there are ways to overcome these challenges and use them reliably. In this review we will discuss domain-specific constraints on data-driven nanomaterials design, and explore the differences between nanomaterials simulation and nanoinformatics that can be leveraged for greater impact.", "Spatially-resolved mapping of rod- and cone-function may facilitate monitoring of macular diseases and serve as a functional outcome parameter. However, mesopic and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP, also called \"microperimetry\") constitute laborious examinations. We have devised a machine-learning-based approach to predict mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) retinal sensitivity in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Extensive psychophysical testing and volumetric multimodal retinal imaging data were acquired including mesopic, DA red and DA cyan FCP, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy infrared reflectance and fundus autofluorescence imaging. With patient-wise leave-one-out cross-validation, we have been able to achieve prediction accuracies of (mean absolute error, MAE [95% CI]) 3.94\u2009dB [3.38, 4.5] for mesopic, 4.93\u2009dB [4.59, 5.27] for DA cyan and 4.02\u2009dB [3.63, 4.42] for DA red testing. Partial addition of patient-specific sensitivity data decreased the cross-validated MAE to 2.8\u2009dB [2.51, 3.09], 3.71\u2009dB [3.46, 3.96], and 2.85\u2009dB [2.62, 3.08]. The most important predictive feature was outer nuclear layer thickness. This artificial intelligence-based analysis strategy, termed \"inferred sensitivity\", herein, enables to estimate differential effects of retinal structural abnormalities on cone- and rod-function in nAMD, and may be used as quasi-functional surrogate endpoint in future clinical trials.", "Sleep apnoea is now regarded as a highly prevalent systemic, multimorbid, chronic disease requiring a combination of long-term home-based treatments. Optimization of personalized treatment strategies requires accurate patient phenotyping. Data to describe the broad variety of phenotypes can come from electronic health records, health insurance claims, socio-economic administrative databases, environmental monitoring, social media, etc. Connected devices in and outside homes collect vast amount of data amassed in databases. All this contributes to 'Big Data' that, if used appropriately, has great potential for the benefit of health, well-being and therapeutics. Sleep apnoea is particularly well placed with regards to Big Data because the primary treatment is positive airway pressure (PAP). PAP devices, used every night over long periods by millions of patients across the world, generate an enormous amount of data. In this review, we discuss how different types of Big Data have, and could be, used to improve our understanding of sleep-disordered breathing, to identify undiagnosed sleep apnoea, to personalize treatment and to adapt health policies and better allocate resources. We discuss some of the challenges of Big Data including the need for appropriate data management, compilation and analysis techniques employing innovative statistical approaches alongside machine learning/artificial intelligence; closer collaboration between data scientists and physicians; and respect of the ethical and regulatory constraints of collecting and using Big Data. Lastly, we consider how Big Data can be used to overcome the limitations of randomized clinical trials and advance real-life evidence-based medicine for sleep apnoea.", "Treatments in psychiatry have been rapidly changing over the last century, following the development of psychopharmacology and new research achievements. However, with advances in technology, the practice of psychiatry in the future will likely be influenced by new trends based on computerized approaches and digital communication. We examined four major areas that will probably impact on the clinical practice in the next few years: telepsychiatry; social media; mobile applications and internet of things; artificial intelligence; and machine learning.\nDevelopments in these four areas will benefit patients throughout the journey of the illness, encompassing early diagnosis, even before the patients present to a clinician; personalized treatment on demand at anytime and anywhere; better prediction on patient outcomes; and even how mental illnesses are diagnosed in the future. Though the evidence for many technology-based interventions or mobile applications is still insufficient, it is likely that such advances in technology will play a larger role in the way that patient receives mental health interventions in the future, leading to easier access to them and improved outcomes.", "Background: An abnormal interaction between cognition and emotion may contribute to the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Aims: In this study, we aimed to evaluate theory of mind and emotion regulation skills in adolescents diagnosed with OCD. In addition, the results were evaluated in accordance with patients' insight levels. Methods: This study was conducted with 50 patients, who were aged between 11 and 16 and who were newly diagnosed with OCD and 50 healthy individuals. The Turkish version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children - Present and Lifetime was used to diagnose OCD and other comorbidities. The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, the Children's Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were used for clinical evaluation. The intelligence levels were assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised Short Form. Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test was used in patients. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale was also used to evaluate the skills of regulating emotions. Results: Patients with OCD had lower ability with regard to reading minds in the eyes and emotion regulation than the healthy individuals. Patients with OCD, who had a poor insight, had more difficulty in reading minds in the eyes and emotion regulation than those with good insight. Conclusions: This study supports the idea that OCD is related to deficits in theory of mind and emotion regulation skills. Thus, further studies are required to confirm the findings of this study.", "With growing availability of digital health data and technology, health-related studies are increasingly augmented or implemented using real world data (RWD). Recent federal initiatives promote the use of RWD to make clinical assertions that influence regulatory decision-making. Our objective was to determine whether traditional real world evidence (RWE) techniques in cardiovascular medicine achieve accuracy sufficient for credible clinical assertions, also known as \"regulatory-grade\" RWE.\nRetrospective observational study using electronic health records (EHR), 2010-2016.\nA predefined set of clinical concepts was extracted from EHR structured (EHR-S) and unstructured (EHR-U) data using traditional query techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, respectively. Performance was evaluated against manually annotated cohorts using standard metrics. Accuracy was compared to pre-defined criteria for regulatory-grade. Differences in accuracy were compared using Chi-square test.\nThe dataset included 10 840 clinical notes. Individual concept occurrence ranged from 194 for coronary artery bypass graft to 4502 for diabetes mellitus. In EHR-S, average recall and precision were 51.7% and 98.3%, respectively and 95.5% and 95.3% in EHR-U, respectively. For each clinical concept, EHR-S accuracy was below regulatory-grade, while EHR-U met or exceeded criteria, with the exception of medications.\nIdentifying an appropriate RWE approach is dependent on cohorts studied and accuracy required. In this study, recall varied greatly between EHR-S and EHR-U. Overall, EHR-S did not meet regulatory grade criteria, while EHR-U did. These results suggest that recall should be routinely measured in EHR-based studes intended for regulatory use. Furthermore, advanced data and technologies may be required to achieve regulatory grade results.", "Background:\u00a0Artificial intelligence (AI) integrated circuits (IC) have memory devices as the key component. Due to more complex algorithms and architectures required by neuroscience and other medical applications, various memory structures have been widely proposed and investigated by involving nanomaterials, such as memristors. Methods:\u00a0Due to reliability issues of mass production, the dominant memory devices in many computers are still dynamic random access memory (DRAM). A DRAM has one transistor and one capacitor, and so it contains two devices and requires a more compact design to replace. Results:\u00a0A one-transistor memory device which is more compact than DRAM is proposed. As far as the authors know, this is the first/novel flexible and transparent one-transistor memory device without any additional process to make a typical transistor and which is based on polyvinyl alcohol. By using indium-titanium-oxide (ITO) as the metal gate, PVA as the dielectric layer and In-Ga-Zn-O (IGZO) as the channel, the memory is implemented mainly based on amorphous oxides and transparent flexible nanomaterials. The charge storage for the memory function was investigated here and is attributed to the mechanism of charge trapping between the ITO/IGZO junctions. It shows typical artificial synaptic transmission behaviors such as EPSC (excitatory postsynaptic currents). Conclusion:\u00a0Such a first flexible and transparent one-transistor memory device based on PVA has one capacitor less than DRAM and could be a potential and promising candidate as an alternative for DRAM, especially in the highly complex AI chips needed for numerous medical applications. The flexible memory nanodevice based on flexible dielectrics such as PVA, which shows\u00a0typical memory and artificial synaptic behaviors, could also be suitable for portable, flexible, transparent or skin-like medical applications.", "Kymographs are graphical representations of spatial position over time, which are often used in biology to visualise the motion of fluorescent particles, molecules, vesicles, or organelles moving along a predictable path. Although in kymographs tracks of individual particles are qualitatively easily distinguished, their automated quantitative analysis is much more challenging. Kymographs often exhibit low signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs), and available tools that automate their analysis usually require manual supervision. Here we developed KymoButler, a Deep Learning-based software to automatically track dynamic processes in kymographs. We demonstrate that KymoButler performs as well as expert manual data analysis on kymographs with complex particle trajectories from a variety of different biological systems. The software was packaged in a web-based 'one-click' application for use by the wider scientific community (http://kymobutler.deepmirror.ai). Our approach significantly speeds up data analysis, avoids unconscious bias, and represents another step towards the widespread adaptation of Machine Learning techniques in biological data analysis.\nMany molecules and structures within cells have to move about to do their job. Studying these movements is important to understand many biological processes, including the development of the brain or the spread of viruses. Kymographs are images that represent the movement of particles in time and space. Unfortunately, tracing the lines that represent movement in kymographs of biological particles is hard to do automatically, so currently this analysis is done by hand. Manually annotating kymographs is tedious, time-consuming and prone to the researcher\u2019s unconscious bias. In an effort to simplify the analysis of kymographs, Jakobs et al. have developed KymoButler, a software tool that can do it automatically. KymoButler uses artificial intelligence to trace the lines in a kymograph and extract the information about particle movement. It speeds up analysis of kymographs by between 50 and 250 times, and comparisons show that it is as reliable as manual analysis. KymoButler is also significantly more effective than any previously existing automatic kymograph analysis programme. To make KymoButler accessible, Jakobs et al. have also created a website with a drag-and-drop facility that allows researchers to easily use the tool. KymoButler has been tested in many areas of biological research, from quantifying the movement of molecules in neurons to analysing the dynamics of the scaffolds that help cells keep their shape. This variety of applications showcases KymoButler\u2019s versatility, and its potential applications. Jakobs et al. are further contributing to the field of machine learning in biology with \u2018deepmirror.ai\u2019, an online hub with the goal of accelerating the adoption of artificial intelligence in biology.", "As new biosimilar and follow-on insulins enter the market, more data are needed on safety, effectiveness, and patterns of use for these products to inform prescriber and patient decision-making regarding treatment. Additionally, data are needed regarding real-world patterns of use to inform future studies comparing the safety and effectiveness of bio-similars to already approved agents for diabetes treatment.\nTo analyze the medication use patterns, adverse events, and availability of glycated hemoglobin (A1c) values for adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who use long-acting insulin (LAI) or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), an intermediate-acting insulin.\nWe used the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium's (BBCIC) distributed research network (DRN) for this descriptive analysis. The analysis time frame was January 1, 2011, to September 30, 2015, and included patients continuously insured for at least 183 days before the first date of a filled prescription for LAI or NPH insulin alone or with rapid- or short-acting insulin or sulfonylureas, whether newly starting insulin or switching to a different product. Insulin exposure episodes were the unit of analysis, and patients were classified in cohorts according to treatment. We followed patients until end of health plan enrollment or the end of the study period. We used occurrence of a study outcome, switch to another medication regimen, discontinuation of the current medication, or study end date to mark the end of an insulin episode. We describe demographics and availability of A1c values for analysis. Study outcomes included severe hypoglycemic events and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).\nWe identified 103,951 patients with T2DM from a database of 39.1 million patients with commercial or Medicare Advantage pharmacy and medical benefits, who contributed 279,533 unique insulin exposure episodes. Most episodes (89%) included patients using LAI, and 52% of patients contributed data to 2 or more exposure cohorts. Insulin episodes lasted an average of 3.5 months, and patients had an average follow-up of 8.6 months. The unadjusted rate of severe hypoglycemic events requiring medical attention was 96.9 per 10,000 patient-years at risk (10kPYR). The unadjusted incident MACE rate was 676.9 events per 10kPYR. 38,330 T2DM patients in the BBCIC DRN had a baseline A1c available, and of those, less than 50% had a follow-up A1c result.\nAmong patients with T2DM, our observed insulin patterns of use and rates of severe hypoglycemic outcomes and MACE are consistent with other studies. We noted a paucity of A1c results available, which implies that additional data sources may be needed to augment the BBCIC DRN.\nThis study was coordinated and funded by the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) and represents the independent findings of the BBCIC Insulins Principal Investigator and the BBCIC Insulins Research Team.

This work was previously presented as a poster at AMCP Nexus 2018; October 22-25, 2018; in Orlando, FL.", "Drug repurposing is a vital function in pharmaceutical fields and has gained popularity in recent years in both the pharmaceutical industry and research community. It refers to the process of discovering new uses and indications for existing or failed drugs. It is cost-effective and reliable in contrast to experimental drug discovery, which is a costly, time-consuming, and risky process and limited to a relatively small number of targets. Accordingly, a plethora of computational methodologies have been propounded to repurpose drugs on a large scale by utilizing available high throughput data. The available literature, however, lacks a contemporary and comprehensive analysis of the current computational drug repurposing methodologies. In this paper, we presented a systematic analysis of computational drug repurposing which consists of three main sections: Initially, we categorize the computational drug repurposing methods based on their technical approach and artificial intelligence perspective and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various methods. Secondly, some general criteria are recommended to analyze our proposed categorization. In the third and final section, a qualitative comparison is made between each approach which is a guide to understanding their preference to one another. Further, this systematic analysis can help in the efficient selection and improvement of drug repurposing techniques based on the nature of computational methods implemented on biological resources.", "It has long been thought that emotional intelligence (EI) involves skillful emotion regulation, but surprisingly little is known about the precise links between EI and emotion regulation. To address this gap in the literature, we examined the relation between EI-operationalised as an ability-and the use of two common emotion regulation strategies-cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Seven hundred and twelve participants from a community sample in Spain were assessed on ability EI (using the MSCEIT) and emotion regulation (using the ERQ). Findings revealed that EI ability was positively associated with cognitive reappraisal and negatively associated with expressive suppression. These relationships were moderated by gender and age. The strength of the association between EI and cognitive reappraisal increased with age for men, while this strength decreased with age for women. Conversely, the strength of the association between EI and suppression decreased with age for men, but increased with age for women. These findings confirm the expectation that EI is associated with greater use of generally adaptive forms of emotion regulation (reappraisal), and lesser use of generally maladaptive forms of emotion regulation (suppression), although effect sizes were quite modest. Observed differences in the strength of associations between EI and emotion regulation may be the result of gender differences in the development of emotional skills along with cultural changes in emotional education and social norms.", "Practical data analysis scenarios involve more than just the interpretation of data through visual and algorithmic analysis. Many real-world analysis environments involve multiple types of experts and analysts working together to solve problems and make decisions, adding organizational and social requirements to the mix. We aim to provide new knowledge about the role of provenance for practical problems in a variety of analysis scenarios central to national security. We present the findings from interviews with data analysts from domains, such as intelligence analysis, cyber-security, and geospatial intelligence. In addition to covering multiple analysis domains, our study also considers practical workplace implications related to organizational roles and the level of analyst experience. The results demonstrate how different needs for provenance depend on different roles in the analysis effort (e.g., data analyst, task managers, data analyst trainers, and quality control analysts). By considering the core challenges reported along with an analysis of existing provenance-support techniques through existing research and systems, we contribute new insights about needs and opportunities for improvements to provenance-support methods.", "Perovskite photodetectors (PDs) with tunable detection wavelength have attracted extensive attention due to the potential application in the field of imaging, machine vision, and artificial intelligence. Most of the perovskite PDs focus on I- or Br-based materials due to their easy preparation techniques. However, their main photodetection capacity is situated in the visible region because of their narrower bandgap. Cl-based wide bandgap perovskites, such as CsPbCl3 , are scarcely reported because of the bad film quality of the spin-coated Cl-based perovskite, due to the poor solubility of the precursor. Therefore, ultraviolet detection using high-quality full inorganic perovskite films, especially with high thermal stability of materials and devices, is still a big challenge. In this work, high-quality single crystal CsPbCl3 microplatelets (MPs) synthesized by a simple space-confined growth method at low temperature for near-ultraviolet (NUV) PDs are reported. The single CsPbCl3 MP PDs demonstrate a decent response to NUV light with a high on/off ratio of 5.6 \u00d7 103 and a responsivity of 0.45 A W-1 at 5 V. In addition, the dark current is as low as pA level, leading to detectivity up to 1011 Jones. Moreover, PDs possess good stability and repeatability.", "Performance strategies used in sport have been the focus of many sport enhancement interventions, and are considered important factors for describing behavior in sport. Several studies have shown that both trait emotion intelligence (trait EI) and satisfaction of basic needs in sport are relevant aspects of performance strategies used by athletes; however, it seems these two aspects were never tested concurrently, in an integrated framework. The aim of this study was to test a mediational model of psychological basic needs in the relationship between trait EI and performance strategies in sports. In a sample of 187 participants, aged between 16 and 25 years old (Mage = 20.55; SD = 3.39), instruments were administered to measure trait EI, satisfaction of basic needs, and performance strategies in sport. Results of this study showed that trait EI was related to performance strategies in sport and to satisfaction of basic needs, as well as that satisfaction of basic needs was related to performance strategies in sport. Furthermore, satisfaction of basic needs has shown a mediational role in the relation between trait EI and performance strategies in sport.", "Immigration in Europe is a challenge for health care systems. Psychotic experiences are not uncommon in the community. Meta-analyses showed that immigrants are at higher risk of psychotic symptoms and experiences than natives. In the international literature, there is little knowledge about the psychological processes explaining the relationship between immigrant status and psychotic experiences. Aberrant salience, the biased assignment of significance to otherwise innocuous stimuli, and alexithymia (difficulty identifying/verbalizing feelings and concrete speech/thinking) have been found to be vulnerability/maintenance factors of psychotic symptoms. This report presents a study investigating whether: 1) adolescent immigrants in Italy report more intense psychotic experiences than natives; 2) aberrant salience and alexithymia predict more intense psychotic experiences; and 3) these psychological processes moderate the effect of immigrant status on psychotic experiences. Knowledge about the role of these processes in psychotic experiences may suggest early detection or prevention strategies.\nOne hundred and forty-eight community adolescents were recruited (mean age =17.57 years, 47.30% females); of these, 75 were born in Italy (natives) and 73 were immigrants (born in countries other than Italy). The Aberrant Salience Inventory, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, and the Screening for Psychotic Experiences were administered in classrooms.\nImmigrants had higher aberrant salience (F=4.38, p<0.05), alexithymia (F=8.93, p<0.01), and psychotic experiences (F=10.65, p<0.01) than natives. Higher aberrant salience and alexithymia predicted more intense psychotic experiences. An interaction effect between immigrant status and alexithymia emerged: immigrants with higher alexithymia had more intense psychotic experiences (\u03b2=0.17, p<0.001).\nEarly detection or prevention programs should focus on aberrant salience in the adolescent population and should consider young immigrants with higher alexithymia as a subgroup with higher psychotic experiences. Mindfulness-based programs may be implemented for this adolescent subgroup to promote emotional intelligence.", "Although heavy metal monitoring campaigns are established worldwide, it is still difficult to model heavy metals in aquatic environments with limited monitoring data. In this study, surface water physicochemical indexes and heavy metal concentrations were measured in a drinking water source in the Taihu Lake region, China. Afterwards, indexes including water temperature, pH, suspended matter, turbidity, and total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorous, orthophosphate and permanganate index were used to simulate dissolved, particulate and total heavy metal concentrations using artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) models. Sensitivity analysis showed that simulated heavy metal concentrations were most sensitive to pH. Thereafter, quick simulation models based on five sensitive parameters (pH, suspended matter, water temperature, total phosphorus and permanganate index) allowed for quick simulations of heavy metal concentrations were built. Both ANN and SVM quick simulation models simulated particulate heavy metal concentrations well with most Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients >0.8. Models performed worse when simulating dissolved and total heavy metal concentrations. Results demonstrate that artificial intelligence models like ANN and SVM are alternative ways to simulate heavy metal concentrations with limited monitoring data. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis may help to identify key factors affecting heavy metal behavior, and to improve environmental monitoring campaigns and management strategies.", "In the past decade, advances in precision oncology have resulted in an increased demand for predictive assays that enable the selection and stratification of patients for treatment. The enormous divergence of signalling and transcriptional networks mediating the crosstalk between cancer, stromal and immune cells complicates the development of functionally relevant biomarkers based on a single gene or protein. However, the result of these complex processes can be uniquely captured in the morphometric features of stained tissue specimens. The possibility of digitizing whole-slide images of tissue has led to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools in digital pathology, which enable mining of subvisual morphometric phenotypes and might, ultimately, improve patient management. In this Perspective, we critically evaluate various AI-based computational approaches for digital pathology, focusing on deep neural networks and 'hand-crafted' feature-based methodologies. We aim to provide a broad framework for incorporating AI and machine learning tools into clinical oncology, with an emphasis on biomarker development. We discuss some of the challenges relating to the use of AI, including the need for well-curated validation datasets, regulatory approval and fair reimbursement strategies. Finally, we present potential future opportunities for precision oncology.", "Although the courses of self-limited focal epilepsies of childhood are considered as benign, a handful of studies suggested that these children may suffer from cognitive problems. Implementing tailor-made educational strategies would aid these children to reach their full potentials. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and differentiate the complete neuropsychological and behavioral profiles of these rather common syndromes. We aimed to examine the distinct cognitive and behavioral profiles of the Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS) and the Gastaut syndrome (GS), comparatively.\nTwenty patients with PS, 20 patients with GS, and 20 healthy controls have been recruited. The testing protocol included Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, Conner's Continuous Performance Test, Verbal Fluency Test, Stroop Color and Word Test, Color Trails Test, Tower of London Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version, Rey Complex Figure Test, Benton Face Recognition Test, Benton Judgment of Line Orientation, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Reading and Writing Test, Child Behavior Checklist, Conner's Parent Rating Scale-48, and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. Demographical, clinical, electrophysiological data, and imaging findings have also been evaluated.\nWith regard to intelligence, the patients with PS scored less in all scales compared to the healthy controls. However, only the performance IQ (intelligence quotient) scores differed significantly between the patient groups, with the patients with PS scoring lower than the patients with GS. Verbal memory problems were eminent in both of the patient groups; whereas, visual memory was impaired only in the group with PS. Psychomotor speed was affected in both groups. Reading problems were prominent only in the patients with PS. Writing and arithmetic skills were defective in both patient groups. There were no noteworthy behavioral problems in comparison to healthy subjects.\nUsing neuropsychological profiles, this study demonstrated that the GS and the PS are two distinct entities. Cognitive dysfunction is a more prominent and widespread feature of the patients with PS; whereas, the patients with GS suffer only from milder and isolated cognitive problems.", "Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a rare genetic disorder (estimated incidence 1/30,000 to 100,000 live births). So far, only a few studies have focused on the cognitive profile of individuals with SRS, and these were conducted some time ago, concentrated on pediatric cohorts, and included patients who had been diagnosed using a variety of clinical diagnostic systems. There has yet to be any research on the intellectual functioning of adults with SRS. This study sought to establish the intelligence, strengths and weaknesses within intellectual profile of adults with SRS, compared with normative data. Ten individuals with 11p15 epimutation aged 18-39\u2009years completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition. Measures of interest included participants' intelligence (Full Scale Intelligence Quotient [FSIQ]) and four domains of cognitive functioning: verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory and processing speed. Discrepancy scores were calculated, and descriptive statistical and linear correlations were used to investigate factors associated with IQ outcome. Clinical and medical information such as rehabilitation, and perceived difficulties in daily life were collected by interviews and questionnaires. Results showed that the mean FSIQ score was in the average range (M\u2009=\u200995.40, SD\u2009=\u200918.55) and they performed best on verbal comprehension. Frequent daily difficulties were reported by patients and/or their families: learning disabilities and low self-esteem were perceived by 60% of adults. Early intervention and multidisciplinary care from childhood to adulthood are important in SRS for care potential medical, cognitive and psychosocial problems. This is the first study to document the intellectual functioning of adults with SRS.", "Motion perception is a critical capability determining a variety of aspects of insects' life, including avoiding predators, foraging, and so forth. A good number of motion detectors have been identified in the insects' visual pathways. Computational modeling of these motion detectors has not only been providing effective solutions to artificial intelligence, but also benefiting the understanding of complicated biological visual systems. These biological mechanisms through millions of years of evolutionary development will have formed solid modules for constructing dynamic vision systems for future intelligent machines. This article reviews the computational motion perception models originating from biological research on insects' visual systems in the literature. These motion perception models or neural networks consist of the looming-sensitive neuronal models of lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) in locusts, the translation-sensitive neural systems of direction-selective neurons (DSNs) in fruit flies, bees, and locusts, and the small-target motion detectors (STMDs) in dragonflies and hoverflies. We also review the applications of these models to robots and vehicles. Through these modeling studies, we summarize the methodologies that generate different direction and size selectivity in motion perception. Finally, we discuss multiple systems integration and hardware realization of these bio-inspired motion perception models.", "Variation in cognitive performance, which strongly predicts functional outcome in schizophrenia (SZ), has been associated with multiple immune-relevant genetic loci. These loci include complement component 4 (C4A), structural variation at which was recently associated with SZ risk and synaptic pruning during neurodevelopment and cognitive function. Here, we test whether this genetic association with cognition and SZ risk is specific to C4A, or extends more broadly to genes related to the complement system. Using a gene-set with an identified role in \"complement\" function (excluding C4A), we used MAGMA to test if this gene-set was enriched for genes associated with human intelligence and SZ risk, using genome-wide association summary statistics (IQ; N = 269\u2009867, SZ; N = 105\u2009318). We followed up this gene-set analysis with a complement gene-set polygenic score (PGS) regression analysis in an independent data set of patients with psychotic disorders and healthy participants with cognitive and genomic data (N = 1000). Enrichment analysis suggested that genes within the complement pathway were significantly enriched for genes associated with IQ, but not SZ. In a gene-based analysis of 90 genes, SERPING1 was the most enriched gene for the phenotype of IQ. In a PGS regression analysis, we found that a complement pathway PGS associated with IQ genome-wide association studies statistics also predicted variation in IQ in our independent sample. This association (observed across both patients and controls) remained significant after controlling for the relationship between C4A and cognition. These results suggest a robust association between the complement system and cognitive function, extending beyond structural variation at C4A.", "The synthesis of complex organic molecules requires several stages, from ideation to execution, that require time and effort investment from expert chemists. Here, we report a step toward a paradigm of chemical synthesis that relieves chemists from routine tasks, combining artificial intelligence-driven synthesis planning and a robotically controlled experimental platform. Synthetic routes are proposed through generalization of millions of published chemical reactions and validated in silico to maximize their likelihood of success. Additional implementation details are determined by expert chemists and recorded in reusable recipe files, which are executed by a modular continuous-flow platform that is automatically reconfigured by a robotic arm to set up the required unit operations and carry out the reaction. This strategy for computer-augmented chemical synthesis is demonstrated for 15 drug or drug-like substances.", "Multiple concussions sustained in youth sport may be associated with later-life brain changes and worse cognitive outcomes. We examined the association between two or more concussions during high school football and later-life white matter (WM) microstructure (i.e., 22-47 years following football retirement) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).\nForty former high school football players aged 40-65 who received 2+ concussions during high school football (N = 20), or denied concussive events (N = 20) were recruited. Participants underwent neurocognitive testing and DTI scanning.\nGroups did not statistically differ on age, education, or estimated pre-morbid intelligence. Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) correcting for Family-Wise Error (FWE)(p < .05) did not yield differences between groups at the whole-brain level. Region of interest analyses showed higher mean diffusivity (MD) in the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) in the concussed group compared to the non-concussed former players. More liberal analyses (i.e., p < .001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons, \u22658 voxels) also revealed that former players endorsing 2+ concussions had higher MD in the ALIC. Analyses that covaried for age did not reveal differences at either threshold. Concussive histories were not associated with worse cognitive functioning, nor did it impact the relationship between neuropsychological scores and DTI metrics.\nResults suggest only minimal neuroanatomical brain differences in former athletes many years following original concussive injuries compared to controls.", "Machine learning (ML) and its parent technology trend, artificial intelligence (AI), are deriving novel insights from ever larger and more complex datasets. Efficient and accurate AI analytics require fastidious data science-the careful curating of knowledge representations in databases, decomposition of data matrices to reduce dimensionality, and preprocessing of datasets to mitigate the confounding effects of messy (i.e., missing, redundant, and outlier) data. Messier, bigger and more dynamic medical datasets create the potential for ML computing systems querying databases to draw erroneous data inferences, portending real-world human health consequences. High-dimensional medical datasets can be static or dynamic. For example, principal component analysis (PCA) used within R computing packages can speed & scale disease association analytics for deriving polygenic risk scores from static gene-expression microarrays. Robust PCA of k-dimensional subspace data accelerates image acquisition and reconstruction of dynamic 4-D magnetic resonance imaging studies, enhancing tracking of organ physiology, tissue relaxation parameters, and contrast agent effects. Unlike other data-dense business and scientific sectors, medical AI users must be aware that input data quality limitations can have health implications, potentially reducing analytic model accuracy for predicting clinical disease risks and patient outcomes. As AI technologies find more health applications, physicians should contribute their health domain expertize to rules-/ML-based computer system development, inform input data provenance and recognize the importance of data preprocessing quality assurance before interpreting the clinical implications of intelligent machine outputs to patients.", "Although small-bowel angioectasia is reported as the most common cause of bleeding in patients and frequently diagnosed by capsule endoscopy (CE) in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, a computer-aided detection method has not been established. We developed an artificial intelligence system with deep learning that can automatically detect small-bowel angioectasia in CE images.\nWe trained a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) system based on Single Shot Multibox Detector using 2237 CE images of angioectasia. We assessed its diagnostic accuracy by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value using an independent test set of 10\u00a0488 small-bowel images, including 488 images of small-bowel angioectasia.\nThe AUC to detect angioectasia was 0.998. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CNN were 98.8%, 98.4%, 75.4%, and 99.9%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 0.36 for the probability score.\nWe developed and validated a new system based on CNN to automatically detect angioectasia in CE images. This may be well applicable to daily clinical practice to reduce the burden of physicians as well as to reduce oversight.", "Abnormal involuntary movements (AIM) may occur throughout the course of psychosis. While AIM are thought to indicate striatal abnormalities, the functional and structural correlates of increased AIM remain elusive. Here, we examined the prevalence of AIM in patients with clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR), first episode psychosis (FEP) and clinical controls (CC). Furthermore, we tested the association of AIM with regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), grey matter volume (GMV), and premorbid IQ.\nWe conducted a video-based analysis of AIM in patients with CHR (n\u202f=\u202f45), FEP (n\u202f=\u202f10) and CC (n\u202f=\u202f39), recruited in the Early Detection and Intervention Center, Bern. Premorbid intelligence was evaluated using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary test. Additionally, arterial spin labeling MRIs and structural MRIs were acquired in a subgroup of the sample to investigate the association of AIM with rCBF and GMV.\nHigher total AIM scores were detected in CHR (p\u202f=\u202f0.02) and FEP (p\u202f=\u202f0.04) as compared to CC. When separated for different muscle groups, lips and perioral movements were significantly increased in CHR patients as compared to CC (p\u202f=\u202f0.009). AIM scores correlated positively with rCBF in the premotor cortex, Brodmann area 6 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05, FWE corrected). Negative correlations were found between AIM and GMV of the corresponding caudal middle frontal gyrus (p\u202f=\u202f0.04, FWE corrected) and premorbid intelligence (p\u202f=\u202f0.02).\nAIM were more frequent in the psychosis spectrum than in clinical controls. Neuroimaging findings indicate an involvement of cortical motor areas in abnormal motor behavior, instead of pure basal ganglia pathology.", "Civil society organizations (CSOs) play an essential role in the global HIV/AIDS response. Past studies have described the beneficial role of CSOs in meeting the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90 target, but have not explored how political conditions, which influence the ability of CSOs to organize, have an impact on the cascade. This study explores the relationship between measures of democracy and its association with diagnosis rates among people living with HIV (PLHIV).\nThis study analyses 2016 data derived from the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index (EIUDI), UNAIDS country estimates for PLHIV and PLHIV who knew their status in 2016, World Bank's 2016 data on nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and country population, HIV Justice Network's 2016 data on HIV criminalization, and country-level estimates for PLHIV, PLHIV who know their status, and expenditure on HIV prevention from other independent sources. An estimated HIV prevalence variable was constructed by dividing the estimated PLHIV population with the total population of a country. Analyses were limited to countries with available data on PLHIV who know their status (n\u00a0=\u00a0111).\nOf the 111 countries in the analytic sample, the mean democracy index score was 5.93 (of the 10), median estimated HIV prevalence was 0.20% (IQR 0.10-0.65), median GDP per capita (in thousands, US dollar) was 4.88 (IQR 2.11-13.79), and mean PLHIV who know their status is 67.12%. Preliminary analysis on the five component measures of the EIUDI revealed multicollinearity, and thus the composite democracy index score was used as the measure for democracy. Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that democracy index scores (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a02.10, SE\u00a0=\u00a01.02, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and GDP per capita (in thousands; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.34. SE\u00a0=\u00a00.11, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) were positively associated with diagnosis rates among PLHIV, controlling for country-level expenditure on HIV prevention, HIV criminalization laws and estimated HIV prevalence.\nResults indicate that higher levels of democracy were positively associated with rates of diagnosis among PLHIV. Further analyses following wider implementation of universal testing and treatment is warranted, as well as the need for further research on the mechanisms through which political cultures specifically influence rates of diagnosis among PLHIV.", "Multi-agent systems demonstrate the ability to collectively perform complex tasks (e.g., construction, search, and locomotion) with greater speed, efficiency, or effectiveness than could a single agent alone. Direct and indirect coordination methods allow agents to collaborate to share information and adapt their activity to fit dynamic situations. A well-studied example is quorum sensing (QS), a mechanism allowing bacterial communities to coordinate and optimize various phenotypes in response to population density. Here we implement, for the first time, bio-inspired QS in robots fabricated from DNA origami, which communicate by transmitting and receiving diffusing signals. The mechanism we describe includes features such as programmable response thresholds and quorum quenching, and is capable of being triggered by proximity of a specific target cell. Nanoscale robots with swarm intelligence could carry out tasks that have been so far unachievable in diverse fields such as industry, manufacturing, and medicine.", "Lifelong learning is a crucial issue in advanced artificial intelligence. It requires the learning system to learn and accumulate knowledge from sequential tasks. The learning system needs to deal with increasingly more domains and tasks. We consider that the key to an effective and efficient lifelong learning system is the ability to memorize and recall the learned knowledge using neural networks. Following this idea, we propose Generative Memory (GM) as a novel memory module, and the resulting lifelong learning system is referred to as the GM Net (GMNet). To make the GMNet feasible, we propose a novel learning mechanism, referred to as P -invariant learning method. It replaces the memory of the real data by a memory of the data distribution, which makes it possible for the learning system to accurately and continuously accumulate the learned experiences. We demonstrate that GMNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on lifelong learning tasks.", "Included among the basic objectives of Physical Education (PE) classes is the consolidation of habits of a healthy lifestyle among adolescents. However, the main studies in this field have focused on cognitive aspects related to students during these classes, yet they ignore the role that emotions can play in the adoption of future habits.\nTo analyze how emotions (emotional intelligence and emotional state) can influence the resilience and motivation of adolescents, as well as academic performance and adoption of healthy lifestyle habits.\n615 secondary school students between the ages of 14 and 19 participated (M = 16.02; SD = 1.57) in the study. A structural equations model was developed using the main variables and by applying some of the principles of Self-Determination Theory. The results show that emotional intelligence is positively related to positive emotions and negatively related to negative emotions. Positive emotions positively predict both self-motivation towards physical education classes and resilience. Resilience positively predicts self-motivation. Finally, self-motivation acts as a predictor of both academic performance and regular participation in physical activity.\nThis study successfully shows the importance of focusing on emotions in PE classes inasmuch as emotion increases the tendency to get good grades and maintain active lifestyle habits. In this sense, focusing on the emotions of students in PE could prove quite beneficial.", "Combinatorial optimization problems over large and complex systems have many applications in social networks, image processing, artificial intelligence, computational biology and a variety of other areas. Finding the optimized solution for such problems in general are usually in non-deterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard complexity class. Some NP-hard problems can be easily mapped to minimizing an Ising energy function. Here, we present an analog all-optical implementation of a coherent Ising machine (CIM) based on a network of injection-locked multicore fiber (MCF) lasers. The Zeeman terms and the mutual couplings appearing in the Ising Hamiltonians are implemented using spatial light modulators (SLMs). As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the use of optics to solve several Ising Hamiltonians for up to thirteen nodes. Overall, the average accuracy of the CIM to find the ground state energy was ~90% for 120 trials. The fundamental bottlenecks for the scalability and programmability of the presented CIM are discussed as well.", "The most common applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug treatment have to do with matching patients to their optimal drug or combination of drugs, predicting drug-target or drug-drug interactions, and optimizing treatment protocols. This review outlines some of the recently developed AI methods aiding the drug treatment and administration process. Selection of the best drug(s) for a patient typically requires the integration of patient data, such as genetics or proteomics, with drug data, like compound chemical descriptors, to score the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. The prediction of drug interactions often relies on similarity metrics, assuming that drugs with similar structures or targets will have comparable behavior or may interfere with each other. Optimizing the dosage schedule for administration of drugs is performed using mathematical models to interpret pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. The recently developed and powerful models for each of these tasks are addressed, explained, and analyzed here.", "Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer but is curable if detected early. Recent publications demonstrated that artificial intelligence is capable in classifying images of benign nevi and melanoma with dermatologist-level precision. However, a statistically significant improvement compared with dermatologist classification has not been reported to date.\nFor this comparative study, 4204 biopsy-proven images of melanoma and nevi (1:1) were used for the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN). New techniques of deep learning were integrated. For the experiment, an additional 804 biopsy-proven dermoscopic images of melanoma and nevi (1:1) were randomly presented to dermatologists of nine German university hospitals, who evaluated the quality of each image and stated their recommended treatment (19,296 recommendations in total). Three McNemar's tests comparing the results of the CNN's test runs in terms of sensitivity, specificity and overall correctness were predefined as the main outcomes.\nThe respective sensitivity and specificity of lesion classification by the dermatologists were 67.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 62.6%-71.7%) and 62.2% (95% CI: 57.6%-66.9%). In comparison, the trained CNN achieved a higher sensitivity of 82.3% (95% CI: 78.3%-85.7%) and a higher specificity of 77.9% (95% CI: 73.8%-81.8%). The three McNemar's tests in 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 tables all reached a significance level of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001. This significance level was sustained for both subgroups.\nFor the first time, automated dermoscopic melanoma image classification was shown to be significantly superior to both junior and board-certified dermatologists (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).", "Freckles or ephelides are hyperpigmented spots observed on skin surface mainly in European and Asian populations. Easy recognition and external visibility make prediction of ephelides, the potentially useful target in the field of forensic DNA phenotyping. Prediction of freckles would be a step forward in sketching the physical appearance of unknown perpetrators or decomposed cadavers for the forensic DNA intelligence purposes. Freckles are especially common in people with pale skin and red hair and therefore it is expected that predisposition to freckles may partially share the genetic background with other pigmentation traits. The first proposed freckle prediction model was developed based on investigation that involved variation of MC1R and 8 SNPs from 7 genes in a Spanish cohort [19]. In this study we examined 113 DNA variants from 46 genes previously associated with human pigmentation traits and assessed their impact on freckles presence in a group of 960 individuals from Poland. Nineteen DNA variants revealed associations with the freckle phenotype and the study also revealed that females have \u223c1.8 higher odds of freckles presence comparing to males (p-value\u202f=\u202f9.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f10-5). Two alternative prediction models were developed using regression methods. A simplified binomial 12-variable model predicts the presence of ephelides with cross-validated AUC\u202f=\u202f0.752. A multinomial 14-variable model predicts one of three categories - non-freckled, medium freckled and heavily freckled. The two extreme categories, non-freckled and heavily freckled were predicted with moderately high accuracy of cross-validated AUC\u202f=\u202f0.754 and 0.792, respectively. Prediction accuracy of the intermediate category was lower, AUC\u202f=\u202f0.657. The study presents novel DNA models for prediction of freckles that can be used in forensic investigations and emphasizes significance of pigmentation genes and sex in predictive DNA analysis of freckles.", "Point sources are important routes through which pollutants enter rivers. It is important to identify the characteristics of and trace the origins of water pollutants. In this study, an artificial intelligence system called the integrated long short-term memory network (LSTM), using cross-correlation and association rules (Apriori), was used to identify the characteristics of water pollutants and trace industrial point sources of pollutants. Water quality monitoring data from Shandong Province, China, were used to verify the applicability of the artificial intelligence system using a cross-correlation method to develop a water quality cross-correlation map. The map was used to identify highly correlated pollutants affecting water quality, then the association rules (Apriori) were used to track the pollutants to industries common in the study area. The highly correlated water pollutants and relevant industries were used as inputs for the LSTM to determine how well the LSTM traced sources of water pollutants. The results showed that (1) changes in water quality were affected in different ways by different industries and different distributions and production cycles of the pollutant point sources; (2) water quality correlation maps can be used to identify regular and abnormal fluctuations in point source pollutant emissions by identifying changes in water quality characteristics and frequent itemsets in water quality indices can be used to trace the industries that most strongly affect water quality; and (3) the LSTM accurately traced point sources of future changes in water quality. In conclusion, the artificial intelligence scheme described here can be applied to aquatic systems.", "The present study examines the effect of the Mindfulness and Emotional Intelligence Program (PINEP), adapted to the virtual learning platform Moodle where participants receive Mindfulness training in 12 sessions lasting an hour and a half. The sample consists of 89 people, assigned randomly to a control group on the waiting list and to an experimental group that undertakes the training. The results indicate that the participants who completed PINEP showed improvement in the variables of health, empathy and mindfulness, in comparison with the participants of the group on the waiting list.", "Despite advances in the assessment of technical skills in surgery, a clear understanding of the composites of technical expertise is lacking. Surgical simulation allows for the quantitation of psychomotor skills, generating data sets that can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms.\nTo identify surgical and operative factors selected by a machine learning algorithm to accurately classify participants by level of expertise in a virtual reality surgical procedure.\nFifty participants from a single university were recruited between March 1, 2015, and May 31, 2016, to participate in a case series study at McGill University Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre. Data were collected at a single time point and no follow-up data were collected. Individuals were classified a priori as expert (neurosurgery staff), seniors (neurosurgical fellows and senior residents), juniors (neurosurgical junior residents), and medical students, all of whom participated in 250 simulated tumor resections.\nAll individuals participated in a virtual reality neurosurgical tumor resection scenario. Each scenario was repeated 5 times.\nThrough an iterative process, performance metrics associated with instrument movement and force, resection of tissues, and bleeding generated from the raw simulator data output were selected by K-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, discriminant analysis, and support vector machine algorithms to most accurately determine group membership.\nA total of 50 individuals (9 women and 41 men; mean [SD] age, 33.6 [9.5] years; 14 neurosurgeons, 4 fellows, 10 senior residents, 10 junior residents, and 12 medical students) participated. Neurosurgeons were in practice between 1 and 25 years, with 9 (64%) involving a predominantly cranial practice. The K-nearest neighbor algorithm had an accuracy of 90% (45 of 50), the naive Bayes algorithm had an accuracy of 84% (42 of 50), the discriminant analysis algorithm had an accuracy of 78% (39 of 50), and the support vector machine algorithm had an accuracy of 76% (38 of 50). The K-nearest neighbor algorithm used 6 performance metrics to classify participants, the naive Bayes algorithm used 9 performance metrics, the discriminant analysis algorithm used 8 performance metrics, and the support vector machine algorithm used 8 performance metrics. Two neurosurgeons, 1 fellow or senior resident, 1 junior resident, and 1 medical student were misclassified.\nIn a virtual reality neurosurgical tumor resection study, a machine learning algorithm successfully classified participants into 4 levels of expertise with 90% accuracy. These findings suggest that algorithms may be capable of classifying surgical expertise with greater granularity and precision than has been previously demonstrated in surgery.", "The paper applies an artificial intelligence centered method to classify 12 clinical safety incident (CSI) classes. The paper aims to establish a taxonomy that classifies the CSI reports into their correct classes automatically and with high accuracy. The study investigates feasibility of applying the C4.5 decision tree (DT) classifier and the random forest (RF) classifier for this purpose. The classifiers were trained using randomly selected 3600 CSIs from an Incident Information Management System (IIMS) used by seven hospitals. The taxonomies investigated were the Generic Reference Model (GRM) and the World Health Organization (WHO) patient safety classification. The classifiers trained 13 GRM CSI classes and 9 WHO CSI classes using a bag-of-words approach. The overall taxonomies performance on the RF classifier was better than on the DT classifier. The performance achieved by the classifier applying the WHO taxonomy was better than the GRM taxonomy. Four of the five poorly performing classes in the GRM taxonomy significantly improved their performance on changing the taxonomy. To improve the WHO taxonomy performance the improved WHO (WHO-I) taxonomy was built by adding a new class that did not exist in WHO but existed in GRM. The performance of the RF classifier applied to the WHO-I taxonomy further improved.", "Advances in both imaging and computers have led to the rise in the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) in various tasks in breast imaging, going beyond the current use in computer-aided detection to include diagnosis, prognosis, response to therapy, and risk assessment. The automated capabilities of AI offer the potential to enhance the diagnostic expertise of clinicians, including accurate demarcation of tumor volume, extraction of characteristic cancer phenotypes, translation of tumoral phenotype features to clinical genotype implications, and risk prediction. The combination of image-specific findings with the underlying genomic, pathologic, and clinical features is becoming of increasing value in breast cancer. The concurrent emergence of newer imaging techniques has provided radiologists with greater diagnostic tools and image datasets to analyze and interpret. Integrating an AI-based workflow within breast imaging enables the integration of multiple data streams into powerful multidisciplinary applications that may lead the path to personalized patient-specific medicine. In this article we describe the goals of AI in breast cancer imaging, in particular MRI, and review the literature as it relates to the current application, potential, and limitations in breast cancer.

Here, we assess links between generative language skills and the perception of prosodic stress, and with musical and parental activities in children with CIs and NH. Understanding these links is expected to guide future research and toward supporting language development in children with a CI.\nTwenty-one unilaterally and early-implanted children and 31 children with NH, aged 5 to 13, were classified as musically active or nonactive by a questionnaire recording regularity of musical activities, in particular singing, and reading and other activities shared with parents. Perception of word and sentence stress, performance in word finding, verbal intelligence (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) vocabulary), and phonological awareness (production of rhymes) were measured in all children. Comparisons between children with a CI and NH were made against a subset of 21 of the children with NH who were matched to children with CIs by age, gender, socioeconomic background, and musical activity. Regression analyses, run separately for children with CIs and NH, assessed how much variance in each language task was shared with each of prosodic perception, the child's own music activity, and activities with parents, including singing and reading. All statistical analyses were conducted both with and without control for age and maternal education.\nMusically active children with CIs performed similarly to NH controls in all language tasks, while those who were not musically active performed more poorly. Only musically nonactive children with CIs made more phonological and semantic errors in word finding than NH controls, and word finding correlated with other language skills. Regression analysis results for word finding and VIQ were similar for children with CIs and NH. These language skills shared considerable variance with the perception of prosodic stress and musical activities. When age and maternal education were controlled for, strong links remained between perception of prosodic stress and VIQ (shared variance: CI, 32%/NH, 16%) and between musical activities and word finding (shared variance: CI, 53%/NH, 20%). Links were always stronger for children with CIs, for whom better phonological awareness was also linked to improved stress perception and more musical activity, and parental activities altogether shared significantly variance with word finding and VIQ.\nFor children with CIs and NH, better perception of prosodic stress and musical activities with singing are associated with improved generative language skills. In addition, for children with CIs, parental singing has a stronger positive association to word finding and VIQ than parental reading. These results cannot address causality, but they suggest that good perception of prosodic stress, musical activities involving singing, and parental singing and reading may all be beneficial for word finding and other generative language skills in implanted children.", "As clinical trials test efficacy rather than effectiveness of medications, real-world effectiveness data often vary from clinical trial data. Given the recent market entry of multiple biologics and biosimilars, a dedicated assessment of these diverse agents is needed to build the evidence base regarding efficacy and safety of innovator biologics and biosimilars.\nThe Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy's Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) was convened to address the lack of real-world, postmarket outcome evidence generation for innovator biologics and corresponding biosimilars. The BBCIC is a multistakeholder scientific research consortium whose participants prioritize topics and collaboratively conduct research studies. The BBCIC conducts a wide range of analyses, including population characterization, epidemiologic studies, and active observational studies, and develops best practices for conducting large-scale studies to provide real-world evidence.\nOver the past 3 years, we undertook multiple descriptive analyses with the goal of characterizing data availability and demonstrating the feasibility and efficacy of using the BBCIC distributed research network (DRN), which includes commercial claims data from 2008-2018 covering approximately 100 million lives, with approximately 20 million active members in 2017 from 2 major U.S. health plans and 3 regional integrated delivery networks. We analyzed 4 medication classes of particular interest to biologics and biosimilars development: insulins, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, erythropoietic-stimulating agents, and anti-inflammatories. We were able to identify exposures and user characteristics in all 4 categories. Herein we describe the successes and challenges of conducting some of our analyses, specifically among insulin users with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\nOur results demonstrate the BBCIC DRN's ability to identify and characterize exposures, cohorts, and outcomes that can contribute to more sophisticated comparative surveillance of biosimilars and innovator biologics in the future. Additional linkages to laboratory data and a wider range of insurance carriers will further strengthen the BBCIC DRN.\nThis study was coordinated and funded by the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) and represents the independent findings of the BBCIC Insulins Principal Investigator and the BBCIC Insulins Research Team.

This work was presented as a poster at AMCP Nexus 2018; October 22-25, 2018; in Orlando, FL.", "This one-year longitudinal study examined trait emotional intelligence as a predictor of Internet gaming disorder (IGD). To date, only cross-sectional research has been conducted to test the protective effects of emotional intelligence against IGD tendency. Based on the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution (I-PACE) model, this study aimed to address the research gap by examining not only the direct effects of trait emotional intelligence, but also its indirect effects (via depressive symptoms and coping flexibility) on IGD, with both a cross-sectional and longitudinal design. The participants were 282 Chinese university students (mean age = 20.47; 39.4% males) who voluntarily completed an anonymous questionnaire at both baseline (W1) and one-year follow-up (W2). Path analysis results revealed that trait emotional intelligence had a protective but indirect effect on IGD tendency in both our cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Depression was found to have a significant, full mediating effect on the relationship between: (i) trait emotional intelligence and IGD tendency (W2) and (ii) coping flexibility and IGD tendency (W2), after adjusting for IGD tendency at the baseline (W1). Gender invariance of the path coefficient was also observed in the prospective model. This study provided longitudinal evidence to support the I-PACE model. Interventions should address both IGD and depressive symptoms, and school-based workshops to increase emotional intelligence and coping flexibility are also recommended.", "This study examined the contribution of perceptual and cognitive factors to speech-perception abilities in cochlear-implant (CI) users. Thirty CI users were tested on word intelligibility in sentences with and without semantic context, presented in quiet and in noise. Performance was compared with measures of spectral-ripple detection and discrimination, thought to reflect peripheral processing, as well as with cognitive measures of working memory and non-verbal intelligence. Thirty age-matched and thirty younger normal-hearing (NH) adults also participated, listening via tone-excited vocoders, adjusted to produce mean performance for speech in noise comparable to that of the CI group. Results suggest that CI users may rely more heavily on semantic context than younger or older NH listeners, and that non-auditory working memory explains significant variance in the CI and age-matched NH groups. Between-subject variability in spectral-ripple detection thresholds was similar across groups, despite the spectral resolution for all NH listeners being limited by the same vocoder, whereas speech perception scores were more variable between CI users than between NH listeners. The results highlight the potential importance of central factors in explaining individual differences in CI users and question the extent to which standard measures of spectral resolution in CIs reflect purely peripheral processing.", "Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a rapidly advancing subset of artificial intelligence that is ideally suited to solving image-based problems. There are an increasing number of musculoskeletal applications of deep learning, which can be conceptually divided into the categories of lesion detection, classification, segmentation, and non-interpretive tasks. Numerous examples of deep learning achieving expert-level performance in specific tasks in all four categories have been demonstrated in the past few years, although comprehensive interpretation of imaging examinations has not yet been achieved. It is important for the practicing musculoskeletal radiologist to understand the current scope of deep learning as it relates to musculoskeletal radiology. Interest in deep learning from researchers, radiology leadership, and industry continues to increase, and it is likely that these developments will impact the daily practice of musculoskeletal radiology in the near future.", "In the last 10 years, emotional intelligence (EI) has become a current issue of research in psychology, and there are indicators to consider that EI should be analyzed to help the coach to behave effectively during competitions. According to Boardley's (2018) revised model of coaching efficacy, coaches' EI is predictive of their efficacy beliefs, which, in turn, is predictive of coaching behavior. However, little is known about the mediating effects of coaching efficacy dimensions on the relationships between coach's EI and reactive behaviors in competitive settings. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine mediating effects of coaching efficacy dimensions on the relationship between EI and coaches' reactive behaviors during a game using a multimethod approach. Participants were 258 coaches of youth football players aged 9 to 17 years old. Observations in situ using Coaching Behavior Assessment System (CBAS) were carried on 258 football games during two seasons. At the end of each game, coaches completed the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS) and the Coaching Efficacy Scale (CES). Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses revealed that motivation efficacy and character building mediated the relationship between regulation of emotion and positive and negative coaches' reactions during game. Specifically, motivation efficacy mediated the association between regulation of emotion and positive coaches' reactions, and the relationship between regulation of emotion and negative coaches' reactions were mediated by motivation efficacy and character building. In addition, coaching level moderated the relationships between EI, self-efficacy and coaches' reactive behaviors. Findings of the present study showed that coaching efficacy dimensions (i.e., motivation efficacy and character building) that have the capacity to influence their confidence in ability to affect the psychological mood and positive attitude of athletes, transfer the effects of EI (i.e., regulation of emotion) on coaches' verbal reactions during a youth soccer game. Specifically, a coach who feels competent to regulate their own emotions would perceive high beliefs of efficacy to motivate and to build character of their athletes, and this insight has an impact on their positive verbal reactions in response to athletes' performances.", "Clinicians need accurate and timely information on the impact of treatments on patient outcomes. The electronic health record (EHR) offers the potential for insight into real-world patient experiences and outcomes, but it is difficult to tap into. Our goal was to apply artificial intelligence technology to the EHR to characterize the clinical course of patients with stage III breast cancer.\nData from patients with stage III breast cancer who presented between 2013 and 2015 were extracted from the EHR, de-identified, and imported into the IBM Cloud. Specialized natural language processing (NLP) annotators were developed to extract medical concepts from unstructured clinical text and transform them to structured attributes. In the validation phase, these annotators were applied to 19 additional patients with stage III breast cancer from the same period. The resulting data were compared with that in the medical chart (gold standard) for nine key indicators.\nInformation was extracted for 50 patients, including tumor stage (94% stage IIIA, 6% stage IIIB), age (28% 50 years or younger, 52% between 51 and 70 years, and 24% older than 70 years), receptor status (84% estrogen receptor positive, 74% progesterone receptor positive), and first treatment (72% surgery, 26% chemotherapy, 2% endocrine). Events in the patient's journey were compiled to create a timeline. For 171 data elements, NLP and the chart disagreed for 41 (24%; 95% CI, 17.8% to 31.1%). With additional manipulation using simple logic, the disagreement was reduced to six elements (3.5%; 95% CI, 1.3% to 7.5%; F1 statistic, 0.9694).\nIt is possible to extract, read, and combine data from the EHR to view the patient journey. The agreement between NLP and the gold standard was high, which supports validity.", "Introduction: Obesity rates continue to rise in America and around the World. Numerous studies show the benefit of bariatric surgery on all-cause mortality in obese patients. Given its substantial role in the future of patient care, we continue to search for the most beneficial ways to optimize patient outcomes and procedural costs in bariatric surgery. Much like laparoscopy was found to greatly improve the morbidity of weight loss surgery, we seek to evaluate the role of robotic surgery in bariatric procedures. Methods: We critically reviewed the available literature accessed through PubMed on the use of robotics in bariatric surgery. We aim to provide an overview of the conclusions from the most recent publications with commentary by the authors. Results: Although the outliers exist, it would appear that the majority of cases point to robotic surgery increasing operating room time and cost without providing significant generalizable improvements in patient outcomes. Promise exists in the use for special groups such as super obese patients or revisional bariatric procedures, however current studies in this subset are equally variable in their outcomes. Conclusion: Despite the current assumptions, we believe there is a future in bariatric surgery for robotics. This may inevitably be seen in the more demanding and difficult cases or in the advancement of the available technology. Likely, as robotics continues to mature, applied artificial intelligence will provide enhanced cues during surgery that augment the surgeon's judgment and skill and result in unanimously improved patient outcomes.", "Chronic stress is a major underlying origin of the top leading causes of death, globally. Yet, the mechanistic explanation of the association between stress and disease is poorly understood. This stems from the inability to adequately measure stress in its naturally occurring state and the extreme heterogeneity by inter and intraindividual characteristics. The growth and availability of digital technologies involving wearable devices and mobile phone apps afford the opportunity to dramatically improve measurement of the biological stress response in real time. In parallel, the advancement and capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning could discern heterogeneous, multidimensional information from individual signs of stress, and possibly inform how these signs forecast the downstream consequences of stress in the form of end-organ damage. The marriage of these tools could dramatically enhance the field of stress research contributing to impactful and empowering interventions for individuals bridging knowledge to practice, and intervention to real-world use. Here we discuss this potential, anticipated challenges, and emerging opportunities.", "Previous studies have shown the positive effects of educational video games (serious games) in improving motivation, attention and other cognitive components in students with learning disabilities. This study analyzes the effects on attention of a serious game based on multiple intelligences in a sample of 44 students (age range = 6-16 years; experimental group = 24; control group = 20) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and specific learning disorder (SLD). Performance and observation measures of attention were used. The intervention consisted of 28 sessions (10 min each), in which the participants trained with 10 games based on multiple intelligences. A significant improvement in attention performance measures (visual attention) was found after the intervention, with the experimental and the control groups significantly differing in the posttest. These results invite consideration of the applicability of boosting different intelligences, talents or unique abilities through educational videogames as an important bridge to improving areas of deficit-in this case attention-in students with learning disabilities.", "Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can be used to detect glaucomatous optic neuropathy, but human expertise in interpretation of SDOCT is limited. We aimed to develop and validate a three-dimensional (3D) deep-learning system using SDOCT volumes to detect glaucomatous optic neuropathy.\nWe retrospectively collected a dataset including 4877 SDOCT volumes of optic disc cube for training (60%), testing (20%), and primary validation (20%) from electronic medical and research records at the Chinese University of Hong Kong Eye Centre (Hong Kong, China) and the Hong Kong Eye Hospital (Hong Kong, China). Residual network was used to build the 3D deep-learning system. Three independent datasets (two from Hong Kong and one from Stanford, CA, USA), including 546, 267, and 1231 SDOCT volumes, respectively, were used for external validation of the deep-learning system. Volumes were labelled as having or not having glaucomatous optic neuropathy according to the criteria of retinal nerve fibre layer thinning on reliable SDOCT images with position-correlated visual field defect. Heatmaps were generated for qualitative assessments.\n6921 SDOCT volumes from 1\u2008384\u2008200 two-dimensional cross-sectional scans were studied. The 3D deep-learning system had an area under the receiver operation characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0\u00b7969 (95% CI 0\u00b7960-0\u00b7976), sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 83-93), specificity of 96% (92-99), and accuracy of 91% (89-93) in the primary validation, outperforming a two-dimensional deep-learning system that was trained on en face fundus images (AUROC 0\u00b7921 [0\u00b7905-0\u00b7937]; p<0\u00b70001). The 3D deep-learning system performed similarly in the external validation datasets, with AUROCs of 0\u00b7893-0\u00b7897, sensitivities of 78-90%, specificities of 79-86%, and accuracies of 80-86%. The heatmaps of glaucomatous optic neuropathy showed that the learned features by the 3D deep-learning system used for detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy were similar to those used by clinicians.\nThe proposed 3D deep-learning system performed well in detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in both primary and external validations. Further prospective studies are needed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of incorporation of an artificial intelligence-based model for glaucoma screening.\nHong Kong Research Grants Council.", "To understand the different patterns of neuropsychological dysfunction observed between juvenile onset (jDM1) and adult onset (aDM1) myotonic dystrophy type 1.\nWe enrolled 19 genetically confirmed DM1 patients, and neuropsychological tests-Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised short form; Rey-Kim memory test; and Executive Intelligence Test for evaluating intelligence, memory, and executive function-were performed. Clinical parameters including cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) repeats, creatinine kinase level, pulmonary function test, six-minute walk test, motor scales, and cardiac function were evaluated.\nVerbal intelligence was significantly lower in the jDM1 than the aDM1 group (7.50\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.64 vs. 11.00\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.54, respectively; p\u202f=\u202f0.009), while no difference was observed in performance intelligence. There was significant differences between the two groups (p\u202f=\u202f0.022) with respect to memory function, as specifically revealed by the pattern of lower function in the verbal memory of the jDM1 group. However, the executive function test showed no intergroup differences.\nVerbal memory impairment significantly deteriorated in the jDM1 group as compared to the aDM1 group, reflecting a more profound neurodevelopmental change in the juvenile type.", "The advent of hydrogel-based strain sensors has attracted immense research interest in artificial intelligence, wearable devices, and health-monitoring systems. However, the integration of the synergistic characteristics of good mechanical properties, self-adhesiveness, self-healing capability and high strain sensitivity for fabricating hydrogel-based strain sensors is still a challenge. Here, a multifunctional conductive hydrogel composed of a polyacrylamide (PAAm)/chitosan (CS) hybrid network is fabricated for wearable strain sensors. The PAAm network is cross-linked by hydrophobic associations, and the CS network is ionically cross-linked by carboxyl-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (c-MWCNTs). These two networks are further interlocked by physical entanglement and hydrogen bond interactions. The obtained hydrogels exhibit excellent flexibility, puncture resistance and self-healing capability because of the efficient energy dissipation of the dynamic cross-linking network. Moreover, the hydrogels exhibit self-adhesive behavior on various materials, including polytetrafluoroethylene, wood, glass, aluminum, rubber and skin. Notably, the hydrogels can be applied as soft human-motion sensors for real-time and accurate detection of both large-scale and small human activities, including joint motions, speaking, breathing, and even subtle blood pulsation. Therefore, it is anticipated that the flexible, self-adhesive, self-healing and conductive hydrogel-based strain sensor will have promising applications in artificial intelligence, soft robots, biomimetic prostheses, and personal health care.", "We set out to demonstrate that the R\u00e9nyi entropies are better thought of as operating in a type of non-linear semiring called a positive semifield. We show how the R\u00e9nyi's postulates lead to Pap's g-calculus where the functions carrying out the domain transformation are R\u00e9nyi's information function and its inverse. In its turn, Pap's g-calculus under R\u00e9nyi's information function transforms the set of positive reals into a family of semirings where \"standard\" product has been transformed into sum and \"standard\" sum into a power-emphasized sum. Consequently, the transformed product has an inverse whence the structure is actually that of a positive semifield. Instances of this construction lead to idempotent analysis and tropical algebra as well as to less exotic structures. We conjecture that this is one of the reasons why tropical algebra procedures, like the Viterbi algorithm of dynamic programming, morphological processing, or neural networks are so successful in computational intelligence applications. But also, why there seem to exist so many computational intelligence procedures to deal with \"information\" at large.", "Sensory memory, formed at the beginning while perceiving and interacting with the environment, is considered a primary source of intelligence. Transferring such biological concepts into electronic implementation aims at achieving perceptual intelligence, which would profoundly advance a broad spectrum of applications, such as prosthetics, robotics, and cyborg systems. Here, the recent developments in the design and fabrication of artificial sensory memory devices are summarized and their applications in recognition, manipulation, and learning are highlighted. The emergence of such devices benefits from recent progress in both bioinspired sensing and neuromorphic engineering technologies and derives from abundant inspiration and benchmarks from an improved understanding of biological sensory processing. Increasing attention to this area would offer unprecedented opportunities toward new hardware architecture of artificial intelligence, which could extend the capabilities of digital systems with emotional/psychological attributes. Pending challenges are also addressed to aspects such as integration level, energy efficiency, and functionality, which would undoubtedly shed light on the future development of translational implementations.", "Interventional pharmacology is one of medicine's most potent weapons against disease. These drugs, however, can result in damaging side effects and must be closely monitored. Pharmacovigilance is the field of science that monitors, detects, and prevents adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Safety efforts begin during the development process, using in vivo and in vitro studies, continue through clinical trials, and extend to postmarketing surveillance of ADRs in real-world populations. Future toxicity and safety challenges, including increased polypharmacy and patient diversity, stress the limits of these traditional tools. Massive amounts of newly available data present an opportunity for using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to improve drug safety science. Here, we explore recent advances as applied to preclinical drug safety and postmarketing surveillance with a specific focus on machine and deep learning (DL) approaches.", "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-based noise reduction algorithm on aorta computed tomography angiography (CTA) image quality (IQ) at 80\u2009kVp tube voltage and 40\u2009mL contrast medium (CM).\nAfter obtaining institutional review board approval and 8 written informed consents, 60 patients (35 men, 25 women; age range: 18 to 85\u2009y) referred for aorta CTA examination were assigned to 2 groups at random. Group A underwent an 80\u2009kVp protocol with 40\u2009mL CM (320\u2009mg I/mL). Group A reconstructed with iterative reconstruction was named as group A1 and further AI-based noise reduction was named as group A2. Group B was scanned with standard 120\u2009kVp, 80\u2009mL CM, and iterative reconstruction algorithm. The quantitative assessment of IQ included aorta CT attenuation, noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio. A 5-point scale (5-excellent, 1-poor) was used by 2 radiologists independently for qualitative IQ analysis.\nThe image noise significantly decreased while signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio significantly increased in the order of group A1, B, and A2 (all P<0.05). Compared with group B, the subjective IQ score of group A1 was significantly lower (P<0.05), while that of group A2 had no significant difference (P>0.05). The effective dose and CM volume of group A were reduced by 79.18% and 50%, respectively, than that of group B.\nThe AI-based noise reduction could improve the IQ of aorta CTA with low kV and reduced CM, which achieved the potential of radiation dose and contrast media reduction compared with conventional aorta CTA protocol.", "Neurocognitive assessments have become integral to comprehensive neuro-oncology care. Existing screening tools may be insensitive to cognitive changes caused by medical treatments. Research supports the clinical value and psychometric properties of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in various medical populations; however, there is minimal evidence for its use in neuro-oncology. The purpose of the current study was to further explore the cognitive profile of patients with primary brain tumor (PBT) using the RBANS and to assess rates of below-expectation performance compared to normative data and estimated intellectual functioning.\nData were collected on 82 PBT patients (54% male; age range, 19-81 years). All patients were administered the RBANS-Update and the Advanced Clinical Solutions-Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF) according to standardized instructions. Cognitive strengths and weaknesses were identified for PBT patients. Descriptive analyses, t tests, and chi-squared tests were utilized to identify and compare cognitive profiles.\nOverall, cognitive performance was low average for PBT patients. When compared to standardization data, PBT patients performed significantly worse across all 5 RBANS indexes, with Attention and Memory showing the largest discrepancies. Estimated intelligence analyses reflected greater deficits in cognitive functioning than when compared to a normal distribution.\nPreliminary research demonstrates the RBANS is an efficient screening tool to assess cognitive deficits in PBT patients. Data also support the importance of comparison to self, rather than normative distribution in ensuring proper identification and classification of patients.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful approach for integrated analysis of the rapidly growing volume of multi-omics data, including many research and clinical tasks such as prediction of disease risk and identification of potential therapeutic targets. However, the potential for AI to facilitate the identification of factors contributing to human exceptional health and life span and their translation into novel interventions for enhancing health and life span has not yet been realized. As researchers on aging acquire large scale data both in human cohorts and model organisms, emerging opportunities exist for the application of AI approaches to untangle the complex physiologic process(es) that modulate health and life span. It is expected that efficient and novel data mining tools that could unravel molecular mechanisms and causal pathways associated with exceptional health and life span could accelerate the discovery of novel therapeutics for healthy aging. Keeping this in mind, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) convened an interdisciplinary workshop titled \"Contributions of Artificial Intelligence to Research on Determinants and Modulation of Health Span and Life Span\" in August 2018. The workshop involved experts in the fields of aging, comparative biology, cardiology, cancer, and computational science/AI who brainstormed ideas on how AI can be leveraged for the analyses of large-scale data sets from human epidemiological studies and animal/model organisms to close the current knowledge gaps in processes that drive exceptional life and health span. This report summarizes the discussions and recommendations from the workshop on future application of AI approaches to advance our understanding of human health and life span.", "To investigate the current clinical applications and diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence (AI) in dental and maxillofacial radiology (DMFR).\nStudies using applications related to DMFR to develop or implement AI models were sought by searching five electronic databases and four selected core journals in the field of DMFR. The customized assessment criteria based on QUADAS-2 were adapted for quality analysis of the studies included.\nThe initial electronic search yielded 1862 titles, and 50 studies were eventually included. Most studies focused on AI applications for an automated localization of cephalometric landmarks, diagnosis of osteoporosis, classification/segmentation of maxillofacial cysts and/or tumors, and identification of periodontitis/periapical disease. The performance of AI models varies among different algorithms.\nThe AI models proposed in the studies included exhibited wide clinical applications in DMFR. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to further verify the reliability and applicability of the AI models prior to transferring these models into clinical practice.", "A preventive measure for debonding has not been established and is highly desirable to improve the survival rate of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) composite resin (CR) crowns. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of deep learning with a convolution neural network (CNN) method to predict the debonding probability of CAD/CAM CR crowns from 2-dimensional images captured from 3-dimensional (3D) stereolithography models of a die scanned by a 3D oral scanner. All cases of CAD/CAM CR crowns were manufactured from April 2014 to November 2015 at the Division of Prosthodontics, Osaka University Dental Hospital (Ethical Review Board at Osaka University, approval H27-E11). The data set consisted of a total of 24 cases: 12 trouble-free and 12 debonding as known labels. A total of 8,640 images were randomly divided into 6,480 training and validation images and 2,160 test images. Deep learning with a CNN method was conducted to develop a learning model to predict the debonding probability. The prediction accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, receiver operating characteristic, and area under the curve of the learning model were assessed for the test images. Also, the mean calculation time was measured during the prediction for the test images. The prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure values of deep learning with a CNN method for the prediction of the debonding probability were 98.5%, 97.0%, 100%, and 0.985, respectively. The mean calculation time was 2 ms/step for 2,160 test images. The area under the curve was 0.998. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology-that is, the deep learning with a CNN method established in this study-demonstrated considerably good performance in terms of predicting the debonding probability of a CAD/CAM CR crown with 3D stereolithography models of a die scanned from patients.", "Since Salovey and Mayer (1990) first proposed the emotional intelligence (EI) as an independent intellectual component, research on the field of EI has developed rapidly. A large number of studies have shown that emotional intelligence is an important predictor that affects our lives, such as job performance, mental health, and so on. However, we observed that some effect sizes in the field of emotional intelligence decreased over time. Is this kind of decline simply due to random errors, or is emotional intelligence field undergoing decline effects? The present study analyzed 484 effect sizes based on the responses of 102,579 participants from nine meta-analyses in emotional intelligence field to estimate the average effect size, and evidence for decline effects in this field. This study finds that the average effect size of EI is 0.244 (p < 0.001), and the average effect size of mixed EI (r = 0.272, p < 0.001) is significantly higher than that of ability EI (r = 0.160, p < 0.001). Effect sizes in the field of EI decrease with time, there are decline effects in emotional intelligence field. Furthermore, there are also decline effects in mixed EI field. However, we find no evidence that there are decline effects in ability EI field. Base on the significant average effect size of mixed EI, the most likely explanation for the decline in effect sizes is that effect sizes of mixed EI in the original studies were overestimate. This study considers decline effects in mixed EI research as inflated decline effects. To sum up, decline effects in the field of emotional intelligence are mainly due to the choice of emotional intelligence model and measurement method.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformational technology that will affect all healthcare providers. This article offers an overview of basic AI concepts and the role of nurses in embracing this technology in healthcare settings.", "With the success rate of drugs for CNS indications at an all-time low, new approaches are needed to turn the tide of failed clinical trials. This paper reviews the history of CNS drug Discovery over the last 60 years and proposes a new paradigm based on the lessons learned. The initial wave of successful therapeutics discovered using careful clinical observations was followed by an emphasis on a phenotypic target-agnostic approach, often leading to successful drugs with a rich pharmacology. The subsequent introduction of molecular biology and the focus on a target-driven strategy has largely dominated drug discovery efforts over the last 30 years, but has not increased the probability of success, because these highly selective molecules are unlikely to address the complex pathological phenotypes of most CNS disorders. In many cases, reliance on preclinical animal models has lacked robust translational power. We argue that Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP), a mechanism-based computer model of biological processes informed by preclinical knowledge and enhanced by neuroimaging and clinical data could be a new powerful knowledge generator engine and paradigm for rational polypharmacy. Progress in the academic discipline of computational neurosciences, allows one to model the effect of pathology and therapeutic interventions on neuronal circuit firing activity that can relate to clinical phenotypes, driven by complex properties of specific brain region activation states. The model is validated by optimizing the correlation between relevant emergent properties of these neuronal circuits and historical clinical and imaging datasets. A rationally designed polypharmacy target profile will be discovered using reverse engineering and sensitivity analysis. Small molecules will be identified using a combination of Artificial Intelligence methods and computational modeling, tested subsequently in heterologous cellular systems with human targets. Animal models will be used to establish target engagement and for ADME-Tox, with the QSP approach complemented by in vivo preclinical models that can be further refined to increase predictive validity. The QSP platform can also mitigate the variability in clinical trials with the concept of virtual patients. Because the QSP platform integrates knowledge from a wide variety of sources in an actionable simulation, it offers the possibility of substantially improving the success rate of CNS R&D programs while, at the same time, reducing both cost and the number of animals.", "There is increasing awareness that the methodology and findings of research should be transparent. This includes studies using artificial intelligence to develop predictive algorithms that make individualized diagnostic or prognostic risk predictions. We argue that it is paramount to make the algorithm behind any prediction publicly available. This allows independent external validation, assessment of performance heterogeneity across settings and over time, and algorithm refinement or updating. Online calculators and apps may aid uptake if accompanied with sufficient information. For algorithms based on \"black box\" machine learning methods, software for algorithm implementation is a must. Hiding algorithms for commercial exploitation is unethical, because there is no possibility to assess whether algorithms work as advertised or to monitor when and how algorithms are updated. Journals and funders should demand maximal transparency for publications on predictive algorithms, and clinical guidelines should only recommend publicly available algorithms.", "The growing demand for computational power has led to the emergence of large-scale data centers that consume massive amounts of energy, thus resulting in high operating costs and CO2 emission. Furthermore, cloud computing environments are required to provide a high Quality of Service (QoS) to their clients and, therefore, need to handle power shortages. An optimized virtual machine allocation to physical hosts lowers energy consumption and allows for high-quality services. In this study, a novel solution was proposed for the allocation of virtual machines to physical hosts in cloud data centers using the Krill Herd algorithm, which is the fastest collective intelligence algorithm recently introduced. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using the CloudSim simulator, and the results are suggestive of a 35% reduction in energy consumption.", "The complexity and rise of data in healthcare means that artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly be applied within the field. Several types of AI are already being employed by payers and providers of care, and life sciences companies. The key categories of applications involve diagnosis and treatment recommendations, patient engagement and adherence, and administrative activities. Although there are many instances in which AI can perform healthcare tasks as well or better than humans, implementation factors will prevent large-scale automation of healthcare professional jobs for a considerable period. Ethical issues in the application of AI to healthcare are also discussed.", "Breast lesion detection employing state of the art microwave systems provide a safe, non-ionizing technique that can differentiate healthy and non-healthy tissues by exploiting their dielectric properties. In this paper, a microwave apparatus for breast lesion detection is used to accumulate clinical data from subjects undergoing breast examinations at the Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Perugia Hospital, Perugia, Italy. This paper presents the first ever clinical demonstration and comparison of a microwave ultra-wideband (UWB) device augmented by machine learning with subjects who are simultaneously undergoing conventional breast examinations. Non-ionizing microwave signals are transmitted through the breast tissue and the scattering parameters (S-parameter) are received via a dedicated moving transmitting and receiving antenna set-up. The output of a parallel radiologist study for the same subjects, performed using conventional techniques, is taken to pre-process microwave data and create suitable data for the machine intelligence system. These data are used to train and investigate several suitable supervised machine learning algorithms nearest neighbour (NN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and support vector machine (SVM) to create an intelligent classification system towards supporting clinicians to recognise breasts with lesions. The results are rigorously analysed, validated through statistical measurements, and found the quadratic kernel of SVM can classify the breast data with 98% accuracy.", "Machine learning is often perceived as a sophisticated technology accessible only by highly trained experts. This prevents many physicians and biologists from using this tool in their research. The goal of this paper is to eliminate this out-dated perception. We argue that the recent development of auto machine learning techniques enables biomedical researchers to quickly build competitive machine learning classifiers without requiring in-depth knowledge about the underlying algorithms. We study the case of predicting the risk of cardiovascular diseases. To support our claim, we compare auto machine learning techniques against a graduate student using several important metrics, including the total amounts of time required for building machine learning models and the final classification accuracies on unseen test datasets. In particular, the graduate student manually builds multiple machine learning classifiers and tunes their parameters for one month using scikit-learn library, which is a popular machine learning library to obtain ones that perform best on two given, publicly available datasets. We run an auto machine learning library called auto-sklearn on the same datasets. Our experiments find that automatic machine learning takes 1 h to produce classifiers that perform better than the ones built by the graduate student in one month. More importantly, building this classifier only requires a few lines of standard code. Our findings are expected to change the way physicians see machine learning and encourage wide adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in clinical domains.", "Learning to get by without an arm or hand can be very challenging, and existing prostheses do not yet fill the needs of individuals with amputations. One promising solution is to improve the feedback from the device to the user. Towards this end, we present a simple machine learning interface to supplement the control of a robotic limb with feedback to the user about what the limb will be experiencing in the near future. A real-time prediction learner was implemented to predict impact-related electrical load experienced by a robot limb; the learning system's predictions were then communicated to the device's user to aid in their interactions with a workspace. We tested this system with five able-bodied subjects. Each subject manipulated the robot arm while receiving different forms of vibrotactile feedback regarding the arm's contact with its workspace. Our trials showed that using machine-learned predictions as a basis for feedback led to a statistically significant improvement in task performance when compared to purely reactive feedback from the device. Our study therefore contributes initial evidence that prediction learning and machine intelligence can benefit not just control, but also feedback from an artificial limb. We expect that a greater level of acceptance and ownership can be achieved if the prosthesis itself takes an active role in transmitting learned knowledge about its state and its situation of use.", "This article presents the data from two surveys that asked about everyday encounters with artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are perceived to have attributes of mind. In response to specific attribute prompts about an AI, the participants qualitatively described a personally-known encounter with an AI. In survey 1 the prompts asked about an AI planning, having memory, controlling resources, or doing something surprising. In survey 2 the prompts asked about an AI experiencing emotion, expressing desires or beliefs, having human-like physical features, or being mistaken for a human. The original responses were culled based on the ratings of multiple coders to eliminate responses that did not adhere to the prompts. This article includes the qualitative responses, coded categories of those qualitative responses, quantitative measures of mind perception and demographics. For interpretation of this data related to people's emotions, see Feeling our Way to Machine Minds: People's Emotions when Perceiving Mind in Artificial Intelligence Shank et\u00a0al., 2019.", "In the era of personalized medicine, the emphasis of health care is shifting from populations to individuals. Artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of learning without explicit instruction and has emerging applications in medicine, particularly radiology. Whereas much attention has focused on teaching radiology trainees about AI, here our goal is to instead focus on how AI might be developed to better teach radiology trainees. While the idea of using AI to improve education is not new, the application of AI to medical and radiological education remains very limited. Based on the current educational foundation, we highlight an AI-integrated framework to augment radiology education and provide use case examples informed by our own institution's practice. The coming age of \"AI-augmented radiology\" may enable not only \"precision medicine\" but also what we describe as \"precision medical education,\" where instruction is tailored to individual trainees based on their learning styles and needs.", "Influenza A viruses are one of the most significant viral groups globally with substantial impacts on human, domestic animal and wildlife health. Wild birds are the natural reservoirs for these viruses, and active surveillance within wild bird populations provides critical information about viral evolution forming the basis of risk assessments and countermeasure development. Unfortunately, active surveillance programs are often resource-intensive, and thus, enhancing programs for increased efficiency is paramount. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence applications, provides statistical learning procedures that can be used to gain novel insights into disease surveillance systems. We use a form of machine learning, gradient boosted trees, to estimate the probability of isolating avian influenza viruses (AIV) from wild bird samples collected during surveillance for AIVs from 2006 to 2011 in the United States. We examined several predictive features including age, sex, bird type, geographic location and matrix gene rRT-PCR results. Our final model had high predictive power and only included geographic location and rRT-PCR results as important predictors. The highest predicted viral isolation probability was for samples collected from the north-central states and the south-eastern region of Alaska. Lower rRT-PCR Ct-values are associated with increased likelihood of AIV isolation, and the model estimated 16% probability of isolating AIV from samples declared negative (i.e., \u226535 Ct-value) using the rRT-PCR screening test and standard protocols. Our model can be used to prioritize previously collected samples for isolation and rapidly evaluate AIV surveillance designs to maximize the probability of viral isolation given limited resources and laboratory capacity.", "Background: It is crucial for companies to understanding users' choices and learning behaviors, and the corresponding influencing factors and cognitive patterns regarding social network services to communicate with potential customers. Methods: In this study, a casual structural model was constructed and developed to model and characterize the relationships between problems to be resolved as antecedent variables and success factors as consequent variables with the intermediary variables based on human learning behaviors, whereas the concept of social network service was introduced to summarize the current issues of social network services and empirically factors affecting effectiveness of social network services. Discussion: This study highlighted the corporate need to examine the intelligent role and learning effectiveness of social network services when studying social creativity and intelligence in a social networking environment. Firstly, the framework and hypotheses of social network services were introduced to summarize the current issues of social network services and the main influencing factors affecting the working patterns of social network services. Subsequently, the empirically established model was further tested to explore the possible meaningful relationships among those variables used. Results: The study revealed that the social network services provider and the customer should improve their social creativity and community collaboration; these could be expanded and enhanced by increasing the social intelligence to raise the social network services' effect and the customer's externalization. Furthermore, social intelligence, community collaboration, and customer externalization were factors significantly influencing customers' social creativity, while the customer externalization and community collaboration were the two important factors affecting social intelligence. Conclusion: The study implied that social network services providers should provide more and more intelligent and inspiring services for their customers.", "The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has been widely theorized over the past couple of decades. It has only been with technological advances over the past few years that physicians and computer scientists have started discovering its true clinical potential. Reproductive urology is a sub-discipline that AI could be of great contribution, as current predictive models and subjectivity within the field have several limitations. We review the literature to summarize recent AI applications in reproductive urology.\nEarly AI applications in reproductive urology focused on predicting semen parameters based on questionnaires that identify potential environmental factors and/or lifestyle habits impacting male fertility. AI has shown success in predicting the patient subpopulation most likely to need a genetic workup for azoospermia. With recent advances in image processing, automated sperm detection is a reality. Semen analyses, once a laboratory-only diagnostic test, have moved into health consumer homes with the advent of AI. AI's prospects in medicine are considerable and there is strong potential for AI within reproductive urology. Research in identifying the factors that can affect reproductive success either naturally or with assisted reproduction is of paramount importance to move the field forward.", "The use of intelligent judgment technology to assist in judgment is an inevitable trend in the development of judgment in contemporary social legal cases. Using big data and artificial intelligence technology to accurately determine multiple accusations involved in legal cases is an urgent problem to be solved in legal judgment. The key to solving these problems lies in two points, namely, (1) characterization of legal cases and (2) classification and prediction of legal case data. Traditional methods of entity characterization rely on feature extraction, which is often based on vocabulary and syntax information. Thus, traditional entity characterization often requires extensive energy and has poor generality, thus introducing a large amount of computation and limitation to subsequent classification algorithms. This study proposes an intelligent judgment approach called RnRTD, which is based on the relationship-driven recurrent neural network (rdRNN) and restricted tensor decomposition (RTD). We represent legal cases as tensors and propose an innovative RTD method. RTD has low dependence on vocabulary and syntax and extracts the feature structure that is most favorable for improving the accuracy of the subsequent classification algorithm. RTD maps the tensors, which represent legal cases, into a specific feature space and transforms the original tensor into a core tensor and its corresponding factor matrices. This study uses rdRNN to continuously update and optimize the constraints in RTD so that rdRNN can have the best legal case classification effect in the target feature space generated by RTD. Simultaneously, rdRNN sets up a new gate and a similar case list to represent the interaction between legal cases. In comparison with traditional feature extraction methods, our proposed RTD method is less expensive and more universal in the characterization of legal cases. Moreover, rdRNN with an RTD layer has a better effect than the recurrent neural network (RNN) only on the classification and prediction of multiple accusations in legal cases. Experiments show that compared with previous approaches, our method achieves higher accuracy in the classification and prediction of multiple accusations in legal cases, and our algorithm is more interpretable.", "Drug discovery and development are among the most important translational science activities that contribute to human health and wellbeing. However, the development of a new drug is a very complex, expensive, and long process which typically costs 2.6 billion USD and takes 12 years on average. How to decrease the costs and speed up new drug discovery has become a challenging and urgent question in industry. Artificial intelligence (AI) combined with new experimental technologies is expected to make the hunt for new pharmaceuticals quicker, cheaper, and more effective. We discuss here emerging applications of AI to improve the drug discovery process.", "Synesthesia is a rare neurological trait that causes unusual, often cross-sensory, experiences (e.g., seeing colors when listening to music). This article traces the history of synesthesia in the period 1876 to 1895. In this period, there was considerable debate over the nature of synesthesia, its causes, and how it should be named. The issue also attracted the leading thinkers of the time and, within a few years, the number of reported cases of synesthesia jumped from around ten to more than 100. For this reason, this period can be regarded as the \"golden age\" for synesthesia research in the nineteenth century. In this time, scientists debated whether synesthesia was a form of pathology or an alternative manifestation of intelligence. The differing roles of heredity and environment were contested, and there were several explanations proposed as to its neural basis. These enquiries went to the heart of the debate as to whether synesthetic experiences are special in any way or, instead, a more vivid manifestation of a more general capacity for forming associations.", "Identifying factors that predict the maintenance of depression and loneliness in children is important for intervention design. Whilst emotional intelligence (EI) has been identified as a predictor of mental health, research examining how both trait and ability EI contribute to long-term patterns of symptomatology in children is markedly absent. We examined the impact of both TEI and AEI on the maintenance of loneliness and depressive symptoms over 1 year in children aged 9-11 years. Two hundred and thirteen children (54% male) completed the TEIQue-CF and the MSCEIT-YV at the first time point of the study, and the Child Depression Inventory and the Loneliness and Aloneness Scale for Children and Adolescents at Time 1 and, again, 1 year later. Findings indicate that emotional skills (AEI) are important for predicting the maintenance of depressive symptoms and loneliness in children over 1 year; emotional self-competency (TEI) is less influential, only contributing to long-term loneliness in girls. Moreover, whilst deficiencies in the ability to perceive and understand emotions were predictive of prolonged symptomatology, so, too, were proficiencies in using emotion to facilitate thinking and emotion management. Those findings carry important implications for EI theory and future research. They also indicate that EI interventions tailored to groups of \"at risk\" school children may be useful for reducing specific profiles of internalizing symptoms. Programs targeting AEI skills may be universally helpful for reducing the likelihood that depressive symptoms and loneliness will be maintained over time in middle childhood; girls at risk for prolonged loneliness would additionally benefit from opportunities to bolster TEI.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that simulates the structures and operating principles of the human brain. Machine learning (ML) belongs to the area of AI and endeavors to develop models from exposure to training data. Deep Learning (DL) is another subset of AI, where models represent geometric transformations over many different layers. This technology has shown tremendous potential in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. More recently, DL has also been successfully applied in drug discovery. Here, I analyze several relevant DL applications and case studies, providing a detailed view of the current state-of-the-art in drug discovery and highlighting not only the problematic issues, but also the successes and opportunities for further advances.", "We investigated whether the presence of interictal scalp EEG high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in children with epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (CSWS) can predict seizure and cognitive outcome after steroid therapy.\nTwenty-two children with CSWS were prospectively enrolled and received methylprednisolone therapy. Interictal scalp HFOs, spike wave index (SWI) and intelligence quotient (IQ) were assessed before and after the treatment. The children were divided into two groups based on the early seizure reduction ratio at 2 weeks (\u226550%, \"response group\"; otherwise \"non-response group\"). The \"response group\" was further divided into two subgroups (\"relapse\" and \"non-relapse\" subgroups) according to the late seizure outcome (after 3 months).\nInterictal HFOs and electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) (defined as SWI\u202f\u2265\u202f85%) were detected in all children at the baseline. In the response with relapse group (n\u202f=\u202f11), the detection ratio of HFOs was significantly higher than that of ESES at 2 weeks (81.2 vs. 27.3%), 3 months (90.9 vs. 36.4%), and 6 months (100 vs. 54.5%) post-therapy. In the non-response group (n\u202f=\u202f4), both HFOs and ESES persisted in all children. The average IQ improved significantly only in the response with non-relapse group. The persistence of HFOs negatively correlated with both the average IQ, yet the persistence of ESES did not.\nInterictal scalp HFOs may be a favorable non-invasive biomarker of predicting seizure and cognitive outcome in CSWS.", "European Radiology Experimental reached the first 100 articles published in two years. Rejection rate was 30%, publication rate increased from 3.5/month in the first 12-month period to 4.8/month in the second 12-month period. The journal metrics were: 25 days from submission to first decision, 96 days from submission to acceptance, and 69 days from acceptance to publication. At the end of May 2019, we accumulated a total of 82,367 article accesses, 541 Altmetric score, and 110 citations for 92 published articles. Europe accounted for 85% of article origin. One third of corresponding authors were not radiologists/radiology residents, but were rather mainly physicists, engineers, or computer scientists. The distribution among subspecialties/body parts was well balanced; 9% of the topics regarded patient's safety, radioprotection, or contrast media. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) accounted for 71% of the articles. Twenty-two percent of original articles/technical notes reported on animal models, 15% on phantoms, 3% on in silico, 2% on human cadavers, and 2% on cells. Nine articles regarded artificial intelligence and/or radiomics, and 2 regarded augmented reality. Of 100 articles, 57 declared funding sources. A total of 517 independent reviews were performed by 92 reviewers. The five articles quoted the most regarded augmented reality, spectral photon-counting CT, artificial intelligence, MRI radiomics, and diffusion tensor imaging of the musculoskeletal and peripheral nerve systems.

However, if you want to view different resources on these knowledge bases, you have to switch between different web pages from these resources. Therefore, we proposed a decentralized data hub named SinoPedia, which consists of several linked data services and can re-publish these RDF data in one platform. Firstly, these different Linked Data services include: Linked Data Transformation Service (LDTS), Linked Data Query Service (LDQS), Linked Data Publishing Service (LDPS) and Linked Data Knowledge Service (LDKS). The resource URI is the basis and core of the linked data, thus we will focus on the resource forwarding mechanism in LDPS service which can rewrite resource URI using a global and standard format among knowledge bases. Some knowledge bases were configured in SinoPedia platform in this paper. In addition to the above services, Linked Data Reasoning Service (LDRS) and Linked Data Intelligence Service (LDIS) will be added to the platform in the future. In short, all of these Linked Data Services will form the core framework in order to providing a good linked data application ecosystem.", "Various forms of relational processing have been linked to cognitive capacity measures, such as working memory and fluid intelligence. However, previous work has not established the extent to which different forms of relational processing reflect common factors, nor whether individual differences in cognitive style also contribute to variations in relational reasoning. The current study took an individual-differences approach to investigate the prerequisites for relational processing. In two studies, college students completed a battery of standardized tests of individual differences related to fluid intelligence and cognitive style, as well as a series of experimental tasks that require relational reasoning. Moderate correlations were obtained between relational processing and measures of cognitive capacity. Questionnaire measures of cognitive style generally did not improve predictions of relational processing beyond the influence of measures of cognitive capacity.", "This lecture is dealing with new, future forms of collaboration and with its (hopefully existing) extended synergies, which may now will come in our era of digitization. Entities in this collaboration are we, the human beings, and other living entities such as animals with 'natural intelligence' as well as non-living entities, in particular functionally comprehensive machines, with 'artificial intelligence'. Based on lessons learned during the last years, among others in a task force on synergy and intelligence (SYnENCE) of the Braunschweig Scientific Society, five consequences for future health care with respect to this collaboration are put for discussion: (1) functional comprehensive 'intelligent' machines should be regarded as entities, not as modalities, (2) such machines have to become users of information systems in health, in addition to human entities, appropriate (3) legal and (4) ethical frameworks have to be developed, (5) extended collaboration in medicine and health care needs to be evaluated in accordance with good scientific practice. The statements of Karl Jaspers, made in 1946 on medicine and on technology, may help us to find a good way.", "Medical imaging is now being reshaped by artificial intelligence (AI) and progressing rapidly toward future. In this article, we review the recent progress of AI-enabled medical imaging. Firstly, we briefly review the background about AI in its way of evolution. Then, we discuss the recent successes of AI in different medical imaging tasks, especially in image segmentation, registration, detection and recognition. Also, we illustrate several representative applications of AI-enabled medical imaging to show its advantage in real scenario, which includes lung nodule in chest CT, neuroimaging, mammography, and etc. Finally, we report the way of human-machine interaction. We believe that, in the future, AI will not only change the traditional way of medical imaging, but also improve the clinical routines of medical care and enable many aspects of the medical society.", "The use of social media to discuss topics related to and within plastic surgery has become widespread in recent years; however, it remains unclear how to use this abundance of largely untapped data to propagate educational research in the field of plastic surgery. In this prospective, observational study, the authors aimed to delineate which plastic surgery-related topics evoked a significant emotional response within the study population and to assess the utility of motivational artificial intelligence within the field of plastic surgery.\nOver a 4-month period (January to April of 2018), Cognovi Lab's artificial intelligence technology was used to search and analyze emotional reactions to several commonly hashtagged words. This innovative software uses several key metrics to describe its findings, including awareness, engagement, and motivation.\nOf the search terms examined, \"nose job\" had the most awareness during the study period, and the topic that most engaged consumers emotionally was \"liposuction.\" Interestingly, \"liposuction\" ranked only fifth in terms of awareness. Consumers showed the strongest positive motivation toward the subjects of \"plastic surgery\" and \"cosmetic surgery,\" and the lowest motivation toward the topic of \"tummy tucks.\"\nThis analysis by Cognovi Labs is the first quantitative effort to use the plethora of data on social media to interpret patient motivations and subsequent behavior. Moving forward, artificial intelligence technology will make it possible to predict which plastic surgery products, procedures, and practices will be successful. The findings presented in this article describe the unique viewpoint and power that this technology can deliver.", "The number of computerized and reliable performance validity tests are scarce. This study aims to address this issue by validating a free and computerized performance validity test: the Coin in Hand-Extended Version (CIH-EV). The CIH-EV test was administered in four countries (Colombia, Spain, Portugal, and the United States) and performance was compared with other commonly used validated tests. Results showed that the CIH-EV has at least 95% specificity and 62% sensitivity, and performance was highly correlated with scores on the Test of Memory Malingering, Victoria Symptom Validity Test, and Digit Span of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. There were no significant differences in scores across countries, suggesting that the CIH-EV performs similarly in a variety of cultures. Our findings suggest that the CIH-EV has the potential to serve as a valid validity test either alone or as a supplement to other commonly used validity tests.", "To determine the influence of nurse education and training on attitudes towards communication, emotional intelligence, and empathy.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted using three separate instruments to measure attitudes towards communication, empathy, and emotional intelligence, and two questions to determine the academic qualifications of the study participants. The effect of the variables was tested using one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlations, and hierarchical multiple linear regression.\nThe study sample comprised 438 nurses from hospitals in Valencia, Spain. Differences in subscale scores of the instruments according to degree level and specialized training were observed, showing that nurses with only a degree and less specialized training had lower capacity for empathy and emotional intelligence. The strongest correlations were found between the factors of the communication dimensions. Multiple linear regression showed that perspective taking and emotional clarity had the greatest predictive power.\nDegree level and specialized training were shown to influence the study variables and it is therefore necessary to prioritize education and training programs that promote the development of these skills to ensure improved service quality.", "This article deals with intelligence testing conducted at Santiago's Juvenile Court, in Chile, between 1929 and 1942. It is based on an analysis of 56 court records containing psychological or psychopedagogical reports filed by the Section for Observation and Classification at Santiago's House of Juveniles, an institution created in 1929 as part of the Juvenile Protection Law. To understand the purposes for juvenile intelligence testing in this field, several articles published at the time by the key actors involved in these institutions will also be analyzed. The results of this research signal, first, that psychology did indeed play a role in the juvenile justice system by laying the groundwork for the idea that it was necessary to measure and diagnose intelligence. The Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale, developed in France between 1904 and 1911 and adapted for Chile between 1922 and 1925, was systematically administered to juveniles in Santiago's Juvenile Court; the results were deployed as technical-scientific recommendations at the service of the presiding juvenile judge. On the one hand, this instrument, supposedly scientific and objective, helped legitimize the nascent field of psychology. On the other, it emerged as a useful tool in its own right to assess children. Second, the notions of intelligence underpinning these practices, while certainly in debt to the American approaches from which they were appropriated, managed to forge a more balanced stance between nature and nurture, positioning intelligence testing as a way of conceiving of and planning to prevent crime and reeducate juveniles.

However, a precision medicine approach alone will not offset the rapid increase in prevalence and burden of chronic non-communicable illnesses that is continuing to pervade the world's aging population. With rapid advances in technology, it is now possible to collect digital metrics to assess, monitor and detect chronic disease indicators, much earlier in the disease course, potentially redefining what was previously considered asymptomatic to pre-symptomatic. Data science and artificial intelligence can drive the discovery of digital biomarkers before the emergence of overt clinical symptoms, thereby transforming the current healthcare approach from one centered on precision medicine to a more comprehensive focus on precision health, and by doing so enable the possibility of preventing disease altogether. Presented herein are the challenges to the current healthcare model and the proposition of first steps for reversing the prevailing intractable trend of rising healthcare costs and poorer health quality.", "Performance on different cognitive tasks could either be positively correlated in an individual as a measure of general intelligence or costs related to specific aspects of cognition could give rise to specialized cognitive phenotypes. Social living offers the potential for individual specialization in learning and a cooperative group can benefit from a diversity of learning phenotypes. However, there is little empirical data regarding the nature of such interindividual variation in learning abilities in honeybees, a classic model of animal cognition. We tested for the presence of variation in learning abilities in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and whether any component of learning has an influence on wing damage, a proxy for performance and survival. Our results show considerable interindividual variation in different types of learning abilities. At the individual level, while landmark and olfactory learning abilities are negatively correlated, olfactory learning shows a positive association with maneuverability performance, a measure which in turn shows a positive influence on wing damage, a proxy for survival. We discuss our results in the context of cognitive diversity and specialization in a social group.", "Application of deep convolutional spiking neural networks (SNNs) to artificial intelligence (AI) tasks has recently gained a lot of interest since SNNs are hardware-friendly and energy-efficient. Unlike the non-spiking counterparts, most of the existing SNN simulation frameworks are not practically efficient enough for large-scale AI tasks. In this paper, we introduce SpykeTorch, an open-source high-speed simulation framework based on PyTorch. This framework simulates convolutional SNNs with at most one spike per neuron and the rank-order encoding scheme. In terms of learning rules, both spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) are implemented, but other rules could be implemented easily. Apart from the aforementioned properties, SpykeTorch is highly generic and capable of reproducing the results of various studies. Computations in the proposed framework are tensor-based and totally done by PyTorch functions, which in turn brings the ability of just-in-time optimization for running on CPUs, GPUs, or Multi-GPU platforms.", "The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is systematically ambiguous between electronic expert systems that are used by healthcare professionals in carrying out their tasks and full AIs, which are stand-alone independent electronic entities that function much like human healthcare professionals except that they are electronic and not biological in nature.

A decentralized blockchain architecture is a flexible solution that can be adapted to institutional and managerial culture of organizations and services. Blockchain can play a fundamental role in enabling data sharing within a network and, to achieve that, this work defines the high-level resources necessary to apply this technology to Tuberculosis related issues. Thus, relying in open-source tools and in a collaborative development approach, we present a proposal of a blockchain based network, the TB Network, to underpin an initiative of sharing of Tuberculosis scientific, operational and epidemiologic data between several stakeholders across Brazilian cities.", "Integration of advanced nanogenerator technology with conventional textile processes fosters the emergence of textile-based nanogenerators (NGs), which will inevitably promote the rapid development and widespread applications of next-generation wearable electronics and multifaceted artificial intelligence systems. NGs endow smart textiles with mechanical energy harvesting and multifunctional self-powered sensing capabilities, while textiles provide a versatile flexible design carrier and extensive wearable application platform for their development. However, due to the lack of an effective interactive platform and communication channel between researchers specializing in NGs and those good at textiles, it is rather difficult to achieve fiber/fabric-based NGs with both excellent electrical output properties and outstanding textile-related performances. To this end, a critical review is presented on the current state of the arts of wearable fiber/fabric-based piezoelectric nanogenerators and triboelectric nanogenerators with respect to basic classifications, material selections, fabrication techniques, structural designs, and working principles, as well as potential applications. Furthermore, the potential difficulties and tough challenges that can impede their large-scale commercial applications are summarized and discussed. It is hoped that this review will not only deepen the ties between smart textiles and wearable NGs, but also push forward further research and applications of future wearable fiber/fabric-based NGs.", "To investigate the validity and efficacy of comparing texture features from contrast-enhanced images with non-enhanced images in identifying infiltrative lung adenocarcinoma represented as ground glass nodules (GGN).\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted with patients presenting with lung adenocarcinoma and treated at a single centre between January 2015 to December 2017. All patients underwent standard and contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scans with 0.5\u202fmm collimation and 1\u202fmm slice reconstruction thickness before surgery. A total of 34 lung adenocarcinoma patients (representing 34 lesions) were analysed; including 21 instances of invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) lesions, 4 instances of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) lesions, and 9 minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) lesions. After radiologists manually segmented the lesions, texture features were quantitatively extracted using Artificial Intelligence Kit (AK) software. Then, multivariate logistic regression analysis based on standard and contrast-enhanced CT texture features was employed to analyse the invasiveness of lung adenocarcinoma lesions appearing as GGNs. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the performance of those models.\nA total of 21 quantitative texture features were extracted using the AK software. After dimensionality reduction, 5 and 3 features extracted from thin-section unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT, respectively, were used to establish the model. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) values for unenhanced CT and enhanced CT features were 0.890 and 0.868, respectively. There was no significant difference (P\u202f=\u202f0.190) in the AUC between models based on non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced CT texture features.\nCompared with unenhanced CT, texture features extracted from contrast-enhanced CT provided no benefit in improving the differential diagnosis of infiltrative lung adenocarcinoma from non-infiltrative malignancies appearing as GGNs.", "Ultrasound imaging is well known to play an important role in the detection of thyroid disease, but the management of thyroid ultrasound remains inconsistent. Both standardized diagnostic criteria and new ultrasound technologies are essential for improving the accuracy of thyroid ultrasound. This study reviewed the global guidelines of thyroid ultrasound and analyzed their common characteristics for basic clinical screening. Advances in the application of a combination of thyroid ultrasound and artificial intelligence (AI) were also presented.\nAn extensive search of the PubMed database was undertaken, focusing on research published after 2001 with keywords including thyroid ultrasound, guideline, AI, segmentation, image classification, and deep learning.\nSeveral types of articles, including original studies and literature reviews, were identified and reviewed to summarize the importance of standardization and new technology in thyroid ultrasound diagnosis.\nUltrasound has become an important diagnostic technique in thyroid nodules. Both standardized diagnostic criteria and new ultrasound technologies are essential for improving the accuracy of thyroid ultrasound. In the standardization, since there are no global consensus exists, common characteristics such as a multi-feature diagnosis, the performance of lymph nodes, explicit indications of fine needle aspiration, and the diagnosis of special populations should be focused on. Besides, evidence suggests that AI technique has a good effect on the unavoidable limitations of traditional ultrasound, and the combination of diagnostic criteria and AI may lead to a great promotion in thyroid diagnosis.\nStandardization and development of novel techniques are key factors to improving thyroid ultrasound, and both should be considered in normal clinical use.", "The eukaryotic cell nucleus is a central organelle whose architecture determines genome function at multiple levels. Deciphering nuclear organizing principles influencing cellular responses and identity is a timely challenge. Despite many similarities between plant and animal nuclei, plant nuclei present intriguing specificities. Complementary to molecular and biochemical approaches, 3D microscopy is indispensable for resolving nuclear architecture. However, novel solutions are required for capturing cell-specific, sub-nuclear and dynamic processes. We provide a pointer for utilising high-to-super-resolution microscopy and image processing to probe plant nuclear architecture in 3D at the best possible spatial and temporal resolution and at quantitative and cell-specific levels. High-end imaging and image-processing solutions allow the community now to transcend conventional practices and benefit from continuously improving approaches. These promise to deliver a comprehensive, 3D view of plant nuclear architecture and to capture spatial dynamics of the nuclear compartment in relation to cellular states and responses.

The current process of evaluating suicide risk is highly subjective, which can limit the efficacy and accuracy of prediction efforts. Consequently, suicide detection strategies are shifting toward artificial intelligence platforms that can identify patterns within 'big data' to generate risk algorithms that can determine the effects of risk (and protective) factors on suicide outcomes, predict suicide outbreaks and identify at-risk individuals or populations. In this review, we summarize the role of artificial intelligence in optimizing suicide risk prediction and behavior management.\nThis paper provides a general review of the literature. A literature search was conducted in OVID Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases with coverage from January 1990 to June 2019. Results were restricted to peer-reviewed, English-language articles. Conference and dissertation proceedings, case reports, protocol papers and opinion pieces were excluded. Reference lists were also examined for additional articles of relevance.\nAt the individual level, prediction analytics help to identify individuals in crisis to intervene with emotional support, crisis and psychoeducational resources, and alerts for emergency assistance. At the population level, algorithms can identify at-risk groups or suicide hotspots, which help inform resource mobilization, policy reform and advocacy efforts. Artificial intelligence has also been used to support the clinical management of suicide across diagnostics and evaluation, medication management and behavioral therapy delivery. There could be several advantages of incorporating artificial intelligence into suicide care, which includes a time- and resource-effective alternative to clinician-based strategies, adaptability to various settings and demographics, and suitability for use in remote locations with limited access to mental healthcare supports.\nBased on the observed benefits to date, artificial intelligence has a demonstrated utility within suicide prediction and clinical management efforts and will continue to advance mental healthcare forward.", "Time series analysis is a data-driven approach to analyze time series of heads measured in an observation well. Time series models are commonly much simpler and give much better fits than regular groundwater models. Time series analysis with response functions gives insight into why heads vary, while such insight is difficult to gain with black box models out of the artificial intelligence world. An important application is to quantify the contributions to the head variation of different stresses on the aquifer, such as rainfall and evaporation, pumping, and surface water levels. Time series analysis may be applied to answer many groundwater questions without the need for a regular groundwater model, such as what is the drawdown caused by a pumping station? Or, how long will it take before groundwater levels recover after a period of drought? Even when a regular groundwater model is needed to solve a groundwater problem, time series analysis can be of great value. It can be used to clean up the data, identify the major stresses on the aquifer, determine the most important processes that affect flow in the aquifer, and give an indication of the fit that can be expected. In addition, it can be used to determine calibration targets for steady-state models, and it can provide several alternative calibration methods for transient models. In summary, the overarching message of this paper is that it would be wise to do time series analysis for any application that uses measured groundwater heads.", "Children aged 2 to 6 years are in a crucial period of growth development, during which it is important for them to attain specific cognition related to concentration and attention so that they can perform well in school later in life. Various factors influence children's cognition during this crucial period. However, to date, only a limited number of studies have examined the cognitive performance of underprivileged children living in poverty, particularly indigenous children (also known as Orang Asli children in Malaysia). Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to determine the associations between sociodemographic factors, nutritional factors (body composition and hemoglobin), and environmental factors (home environment and parasitic infections) with cognitive performance among Orang Asli children in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. The participants were 269 children (51% boys, 49% girls) aged 2 to 6 years (M = 4.0, SD = 1.2 years) and their mothers, from 14 Orang Asli villages. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with the mothers, and the children's cognitive performance, operationalized as working memory index (WMI), processing speed index (PSI), and cognitive proficiency index (CPI), was assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV). The children's weight and height were measured, and their blood and stool samples were collected to assess hemoglobin level and parasitic infections, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the father's years of education (\u03b2 = 0.262-0.342, p < 0.05), availability of learning materials at home (\u03b2 = 0.263-0.425, p < 0.05), and responsiveness of the parent to the child (\u03b2 = 0.192-0.331, p < 0.05) were consistently associated with all three cognitive indices (WMI, PSI, and CPI). A holistic approach involving parents, communities, and government agencies should be established to improve the cognitive performance of these underprivileged children.", "Lower gestational age may increase autism spectrum disorder (ASD) vulnerability; however, the incidence of ASD diagnosis through a direct assessment on every very preterm birth child on the population base remains unclear. Moreover, the behavioral characteristics of preterm birth ASD are unknown.\nEvery very preterm birth child (gestational age <\u200932\u2009weeks; birth weight <\u20091500\u2009g) who was discharged from neonatal intensive care units in Southern Taiwan and prospectively followed to 5\u2009years of age was evaluated using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). The term birth (gestational age >\u200937\u2009weeks) ASD children characterized by ADOS and ADI-R were group matched to the preterm birth ASD by age at examination for comparison. ADOS severity scores were calculated by the Mann-Whitney U test and ADI-R by multivariate analysis of variance and canonical discriminant analysis.\nTwo hundred forty-six (87%) of the 283 very preterm survivors were followed prospectively to 5\u2009years of age. Nineteen (7.7%) of the 246 children fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of ASD. After excluding 1 patient with cerebral palsy and profound mental disability, 18 preterm ASD children were compared with 44 term birth ASD children. The two ASD groups were comparable for age at examination, gender, and intelligence quotient. The two groups showed comparable ADOS severity scores in social affect deficits, restricted repetitive behaviors, and total score, but had differences in qualitative abnormalities in reciprocal social interaction (Wilks lambda F value\u2009=\u20096.2, P\u2009<\u20090.001) of ADI-R. Compared to term birth ASD children, preterm birth ASD children exhibited worse nonverbal behaviors that regulate social interaction (OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.41-4.73, P\u2009=\u20090.002) but more favorable peer relationships (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.90, P\u2009=\u20090.01) and socioemotional reciprocity (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.92, P\u2009=\u20090.02). In contrast to the heterogeneous severity of social reciprocity in the term ASD group, the behavioral characteristics of the preterm ASD group showed a homogeneous reciprocal social interaction pattern.\nThe 5-year incidence rate of ASD was high in very preterm birth children. Preterm birth ASD exhibited a specific behavioral phenotype of reciprocal social interaction.", "Background: Current manual diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening using eye care experts cannot scale to screen the growing population of diabetes patients who are at risk for vision loss. EyeArt system is an automated, cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) eye screening technology designed to easily detect referral-warranted DR immediately through automated analysis of patient's retinal images. Methods: This retrospective study assessed the diagnostic efficacy of the EyeArt system v2.0 analyzing 850,908 fundus images from 101,710 consecutive patient visits, collected from 404 primary care clinics. Presence or absence of referral-warranted DR (more than mild nonproliferative DR [NPDR]) was automatically detected by the EyeArt system for each patient encounter, and its performance was compared against a clinical reference standard of quality-assured grading by rigorously trained certified ophthalmologists and optometrists. Results: Of the 101,710 visits, 75.7% were nonreferable, 19.3% were referable to an eye care specialist, and in 5.0%, the DR level was unknown as per the clinical reference standard. EyeArt screening had 91.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90.9-91.7) sensitivity and 91.1% (95% CI: 90.9-91.3) specificity. For 5446 encounters with potentially treatable DR (more than moderate NPDR and/or diabetic macular edema), the system provided a positive \"refer\" output to 5363 encounters achieving sensitivity of 98.5%. Conclusions: This study captures variations in real-world clinical practice and shows that an AI DR screening system can be safe and effective in the real world. This study demonstrates the value of this easy-to-use, automated tool for endocrinologists, diabetologists, and general practitioners to address the growing need for DR screening and monitoring.", "Artificial Intelligence based on Deep Learning (DL) is opening new horizons in biomedical research and promises to revolutionize the microscopy field. It is now transitioning from the hands of experts in computer sciences to biomedical researchers. Here, we introduce recent developments in DL applied to microscopy, in a manner accessible to non-experts. We give an overview of its concepts, capabilities and limitations, presenting applications in image segmentation, classification and restoration. We discuss how DL shows an outstanding potential to push the limits of microscopy, enhancing resolution, signal and information content in acquired data. Its pitfalls are discussed, along with the future directions expected in this field.", "We contend that work ambivalence is a key building block in fostering physician burnout and its sequalae, while engagement in meaningful work and receiving family support for that work enhances resilience. No singular approach to curbing burnout in OBGYN physicians has received empirical support. Clinical experience suggests that curbing physician burnout requires a combination of workplace redesigns, positive leadership behaviors, and resilience training that teaches practical applications from the fields of resilience, emotional intelligence, positive psychology, and relationship systems. This paper highlights organizational and leadership interventions that foster physician engagement, and describes how physicians can foster personal and family resilience.", "Few artificial intelligence-based technologies have been developed to improve the efficiency of screening for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Here, we developed and validated a novel system of computer-aided detection (CAD) using a deep neural network (DNN) to localize and identify early ESCC under conventional endoscopic white-light imaging.\nWe collected 2428 (1332 abnormal, 1096 normal) esophagoscopic images from 746 patients to set up a novel DNN-CAD system in 2 centers and prepared a validation dataset containing 187 images from 52 patients. Sixteen endoscopists (senior, mid-level, and junior) were asked to review the images of the validation set. The diagnostic results, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), were compared between the DNN-CAD system and endoscopists.\nThe receiver operating characteristic curve for DNN-CAD showed that the area under the curve was >96%. For the validation dataset, DNN-CAD had a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of 97.8%, 85.4%, 91.4%, 86.4%, and 97.6%, respectively. The senior group achieved an average diagnostic accuracy of 88.8%, whereas the junior group had a lower value of 77.2%. After referring to the results of DNN-CAD, the average diagnostic ability of the endoscopists improved, especially in terms of sensitivity (74.2% vs 89.2%), accuracy (81.7% vs 91.1%), and NPV (79.3% vs 90.4%).\nThe novel DNN-CAD system used for screening of early ESCC has high accuracy and sensitivity, and can help endoscopists to detect lesions previously ignored under white-light imaging.", "Medulloblastoma is the most common primary malignant central nervous system tumor in childhood, accounting for 16-25% of cases (1). New treatment approaches have led to improved survival rates; however toxicities are still a major concern.\nParticipants were selected from the records of patients who were treated with craniospinal irradiation for medulloblastoma. Between January 2008 and December 2012, 62 patients were diagnosed with medulloblastoma at the national institute of oncology Rabat, 27 patients were still alive at the time of the study, of which n=16 patients were included in the study. The mean age of patients at the time of the study was 9.6 years. All children were treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, according to standard protocols. Median follow-up between treatment and evaluation was 4 years. All the children were assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u00a0-\u00a0fourth Edition (WISC-IV) three to five years after completion of radiotherapy. The test was administered by two well-trained psychologists in a distraction-free environment. The scoring was then reviewed by a psychologist from Brooklyn College.\nThe mean standard score Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) (M=63, SD=12.6) was found to be in the extremely low range and in the 1st percentile rank (PR), compared to the general population. All the measured primary index scales were below typical performance: verbal comprehension (M=67.7, SD=13.1), perceptual reasoning (M=63.5, SD=13.8) and processing speed (M=62.7, SD=15.5) were all found to be in the extremely low range, while xorking memory (M=75.5, SD=10.8) was found to be in the borderline range compared to the general population. To identify factors influencing the results, we performed both univariate and multivariate analyses. Age at the time of radiotherapy, initial clinical stage, total cranial radiotherapy dose, socioeconomic status, and the time of evaluation were identified as significantly impacting cognitive scores in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, only age at the time of radiotherapy and initial clinical stage remained factors significantly impacting cognitive outcomes with P=0.001 and P<0.001 respectively.\nOur study is evidence that tremendous efforts are still to be made in low-income countries to correctly measure neurocognitive dysfunction in medulloblastoma survivors and to prepare those patients to a typical life after the completion of treatment.", "Illicit drug profiling can provide knowledge about illicit drug markets, informing on the level of distribution and its evolution in space and time. Illicit drug profiling is usually limited to impurities originally present in the illicit drug (e.g. alkaloids, co-extracted compounds or by-products). However, the benefit of a comprehensive analysis of cutting agents in drug seizures for law enforcement agencies, intelligence and health policy has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature and is the focus of this research.\nThis research aims at assessing when and how cutting (i.e. adulteration and dilution) occurs in the supply chain by analysing cocaine and heroin seizures made between 2006 and 2015 in Switzerland.\nCocaine and heroin seizures made along the supply chain by law enforcement agencies in the Western region of Switzerland were investigated for adulteration and dilution. A total number of 7841 cocaine and 3476 heroin specimens coming from 1341 and 721 seizures, respectively, were analysed.\nThe results show that, for both illicit drugs, adulteration and/or dilution occur before arrival into Switzerland as well as in Switzerland. While cocaine is adulterated and diluted, heroin is only adulterated. Interestingly, the same mixture of adulterants (i.e. caffeine-paracetamol) is used to cut heroin at each step in the supply chain.\nGaining knowledge about adulteration and dilution at different stages in the supply chain enhances our understanding of drug markets. It also highlights differences along the supply chain and in the distribution of both drugs in Switzerland.", "Although many prognosis-predicting molecular scores for breast cancer have been developed, they are applicable to only limited disease subtypes. We aimed to develop a novel prognostic score that is applicable to a wider range of breast cancer patients.\nWe initially examined The Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer cohort to identify potential prognosis-related genes. We then performed a meta-analysis of 36 international breast cancer cohorts to validate such genes. We trained artificial intelligence models (random forest and neural network) to predict prognosis precisely, and we finally validated our prediction with the log-rank test.\nWe identified a comprehensive list of 184 prognosis-related genes, most of which have been not extensively studied to date. We then established a universal molecular prognostic score (mPS) that relies on the expression status of only 23 of these genes. The mPS system is almost universally applicable to breast cancer patients (log-rank P\u202f<\u202f0.05) in a manner independent of platform (microarray or RNA sequencing).\nThe mPS system is simple and cost-effective to apply and yet is able to reveal previously unrecognized heterogeneity among patient subpopulations in a platform-independent manner. The combination of mPS and clinical stage stratifies prognosis even more precisely and should prove of value for avoidance of overtreatment. In addition, the prognosis-related genes uncovered in this study are potential drug targets.

This study analyzes how late childhood intelligence, parental socioeconomic background, and gender relate to multiple dimensions of adult socioeconomic success (i.e., education, occupational status, and income). A particular focus is placed on education, which is considered as both an indicator of socioeconomic success and a mediator of the relationships with the other dimensions. Randomly sampled participants (N = 5,292) in a German prospective longitudinal study were assessed for the first time at age 12 years in 1991 and for the last time as adults in 2009-10. Comparison of the effects of childhood intelligence and parental socioeconomic background revealed childhood intelligence to be the more powerful predictor of the 3 dimensions of later adult socioeconomic success. Education was the strongest predictor of both later adult occupational status and later adult income, and mediated most of the effects of childhood intelligence and parental socioeconomic background on later adult occupational status and later adult income. A gender income gap was apparent, with men reporting higher income, even when childhood factors and education were controlled. Education barely mediated any gender differences, but family-related structural factors (i.e., working part time and having children) explained much of the gender gap in income.

In this article, leaders of the Association of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Division Directors describe two leadership skills that are often required to effectively lead in a clinical division at an academic or community hospital setting: leading change and negotiation strategy. We adopted our discussion from the business sector and refined the approaches through our own experiences to help division leaders in leading a successful team, whether as a division chief, residency or fellowship program director, or a clinical service director. Leading any change project may include an eight-step process, starting with creating a sense of urgency and completing with anchoring the change to the organizational culture. We then review negotiation strategies, comparing positional bargaining vs\u00a0principled negotiation, to create more changes and continuing growth for the division. Finally, we discuss the importance of emotional intelligence, exemplary leadership practices, and self-development that the division leader should embrace.", "Recent developmental models assume a higher tendency to take risks in mid-adolescence, while the empirical evidence for this assumption is rather mixed. Most of the studies applied quite different tasks to measure risk-taking behavior and used a narrow age range. The main goal of the present study was to examine risk-taking behavior in four task settings, the Treasure Hunting Task (THT) in a gain and a loss domain, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), and the STOPLIGHT task. These task settings differ in affective task moderators, like descriptive vs. experienced outcomes, anticipation of gains vs. losses, static vs. dynamic risk presentation, and time pressure vs. no time pressure and were applied in a sample of 187 participants from age 9-18. Beneath age trends, we were interested in their association with individual differences in approach behavior, venturesomeness, impulsivity, and empathy above age, gender, and fluid intelligence. Our findings revealed that risk-taking behavior is only low to moderately correlated between the four task contexts, suggesting that they capture different aspects of risk-taking behavior. Accordingly, a mid-adolescent peak in risk propensity was only found under time pressure in the STOPLIGHT that was associated with higher impulsivity and empathy. In contrast, risky decisions decreased with increasing age in task settings, in which losses were anticipated (THT Loss), and this was associated with higher cognitive abilities. We found no age differences when gains were anticipated, neither in a static (THT Gain) nor in a dynamic task setting (BART). These findings clearly suggest the need to consider affective task moderators, as well as individual differences in temperament and cognitive abilities, in actual models about adolescent development.", "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical condition associated with poor patient outcomes. We aimed to review the current concepts and future strategies regarding AKI risk prediction models.\nRecent studies have shown that AKI occurs frequently in patients with common risk factors and certain medical conditions. Prediction models for AKI risk have been reported in medical fields such as critical care medicine, surgery, nephrotoxic agent exposure, and others. However, practical, generalizable, externally validated, and robust AKI prediction models remain relatively rare. Further efforts to develop AKI prediction models based on comprehensive clinical data, artificial intelligence, improved delivery of care, and novel biomarkers may help improve patient outcomes through precise AKI risk prediction.\nThis brief review provides insights for current concepts for AKI prediction model development. In addition, by overviewing the recent AKI prediction models in various medical fields, future strategies to construct advanced AKI prediction models are suggested.", "The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in aiding clinical decision-making and management of stroke and heart diseases have become increasingly common in recent years, thanks in part to technological advancements and the heightened interest of the research and medical community. This study aims to provide a comprehensive picture of global trends and developments of AI applications relating to stroke and heart diseases, identifying research gaps and suggesting future directions for research and policy-making. A novel analysis approach that combined bibliometrics analysis with a more complex analysis of abstract content using exploratory factor analysis and Latent Dirichlet allocation, which uncovered emerging research domains and topics, was adopted. Data were extracted from the Web of Science database. Results showed topics with the most compelling growth to be AI for big data analysis, robotic prosthesis, robotics-assisted stroke rehabilitation, and minimally invasive surgery. The study also found an emerging landscape of research that was centered on population-specific and early detection of stroke and heart disease. Application of AI in health behavior tracking and improvement as well as the use of robotics in medical diagnostics and prognostication have also been found to attract significant research attention. In light of these findings, it is suggested that the currently under-researched issues of data management, AI model reliability, as well as validation of its clinical utility, need to be further explored in future research and policy decisions to maximize the benefits of AI applications in stroke and heart diseases.", "Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is rapidly developing and changing the paradigm of neurorestoration by linking cortical activity with control of an external effector to provide patients with tangible improvements in their ability to interact with the environment. The sensor component of a BCI circuit dictates the resolution of brain pattern recognition and therefore plays an integral role in the technology. Several sensor modalities are currently in use for BCI applications and are broadly either electrode-based or functional neuroimaging-based. Sensors vary in their inherent spatial and temporal resolutions, as well as in practical aspects such as invasiveness, portability, and maintenance. Hybrid BCI systems with multimodal sensory inputs represent a promising development in the field allowing for complimentary function. Artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms have been applied to BCI systems to achieve faster and more accurate classifications of sensory input and improve user performance in various tasks. Neurofeedback is an important advancement in the field that has been implemented in several types of BCI systems by showing users a real-time display of their recorded brain activity during a task to facilitate their control over their own cortical activity. In this way, neurofeedback has improved BCI classification and enhanced user control over BCI output. Taken together, BCI systems have progressed significantly in recent years in terms of accuracy, speed, and communication. Understanding the sensory components of a BCI is essential for neurosurgeons and clinicians as they help advance this technology in the clinical setting.", "The idea that intelligence is embedded not only in a single brain network, but instead in a complex, well-optimized system of complementary networks, has led to the development of whole brain network analysis. Using graph theory to analyze resting-state functional MRI data, we investigated the brain graph networks (or brain networks) of high intelligence quotient (HIQ) children. To this end, we computed the \"hub disruption index \u03ba,\" an index sensitive to graph network modifications. We found significant topological differences in the integration and segregation properties of brain networks in HIQ compared to standard IQ children, not only for the whole brain graph, but also for each hemispheric graph, and for the homotopic connectivity. Moreover, two profiles of HIQ children, homogenous and heterogeneous, based on the differences between the two main IQ subscales [verbal comprehension index (VCI) and perceptual reasoning index (PRI)], were compared. Brain network changes were more pronounced in the heterogeneous than in the homogeneous HIQ subgroups. Finally, we found significant correlations between the graph networks' changes and the full-scale IQ (FSIQ), as well as the subscales VCI and PRI. Specifically, the higher the FSIQ the greater was the brain organization modification in the whole brain, the left hemisphere, and the homotopic connectivity. These results shed new light on the relation between functional connectivity topology and high intelligence, as well as on different intelligence profiles.", "The term 'dyslexia' refers to a condition that impacts upon reading and writing abilities whilst not altering intelligence. Individuals with dyslexia may have difficulties with the speed and accuracy and their reading and writing, amongst other issues. Dyslexia is not automatically considered a disability but is a protected characteristic under the UK Equality Act (2010), and therefore employers and educational institutions are required to provide 'reasonable adjustments' in order to allow individuals to reach their full potential. There is a lack of research on this issue, but what little there is suggests that doctors feel as though any support they received ended when they graduated from medical school.\nA core distinction between medical school and medical practice is the requirement to prescribe medicines as registered medical practitioners. Junior doctors have to master this complex and potentially hazardous skill \"on the job\", with a perceived lack of support. Here, we open up a debate about the potential impact of dyslexia on prescribing, and the need to find supports that may be effective in enabling doctors with dyslexia prescribe medicines safely and effectively - and thus reach their full potential as medical practitioners and promote patient safety.\nWe argue that medical schools and hospitals could immediately provide dyslexia awareness training in both undergraduate and postgraduate settings. We discuss electronic prescribing systems, and conclude that research is required to identify effective supports for junior doctors with dyslexia.", "Nature-inspired algorithms are based on the concepts of self-organization and complex biological systems. They have been designed by researchers and scientists to solve complex problems in various environmental situations by observing how naturally occurring phenomena behave. The introduction of nature-inspired algorithms has led to new branches of study such as neural networks, swarm intelligence, evolutionary computation, and artificial immune systems. Particle swarm optimization (PSO), social spider optimization (SSO), and other nature-inspired algorithms have found some success in solving clustering problems but they may converge to local optima due to the lack of balance between exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we propose a novel implementation of SSO, namely social spider optimization for data clustering using single centroid representation and enhanced mating operation (SSODCSC) in order to improve the balance between exploration and exploitation. In SSODCSC, we implemented each spider as a collection of a centroid and the data instances close to it. We allowed non-dominant male spiders to mate with female spiders by converting them into dominant males. We found that SSODCSC produces better values for the sum of intra-cluster distances, the average CPU time per iteration (in seconds), accuracy, the F-measure, and the average silhouette coefficient as compared with the K-means and other nature-inspired techniques. When the proposed algorithm is compared with other nature-inspired algorithms with respect to Patent corpus datasets, the overall percentage increase in the accuracy is approximately 13%. When it is compared with other nature-inspired algorithms with respect to UCI datasets, the overall percentage increase in the F-measure value is approximately 10%. For completeness, the best K cluster centroids (the best K spiders) returned by SSODCSC were specified. To show the significance of the proposed algorithm, we conducted a one-way ANOVA test on the accuracy values and the F-measure values returned by the clustering algorithms.", "One decade ago, Bitcoin was introduced, becoming the first cryptocurrency and establishing the concept of \"blockchain\" as a distributed ledger. As of today, there are many different implementations of cryptocurrencies working over a blockchain, with different approaches and philosophies. However, many of them share one common feature: they require proof-of-work to support the generation of blocks (mining) and, eventually, the generation of money. This proof-of-work scheme often consists in the resolution of a cryptography problem, most commonly breaking a hash value, which can only be achieved through brute-force. The main drawback of proof-of-work is that it requires ridiculously large amounts of energy which do not have any useful outcome beyond supporting the currency. In this paper, we present a theoretical proposal that introduces a proof-of-useful-work scheme to support a cryptocurrency running over a blockchain, which we named Coin.AI. In this system, the mining scheme requires training deep learning models, and a block is only mined when the performance of such model exceeds a threshold. The distributed system allows for nodes to verify the models delivered by miners in an easy way (certainly much more efficiently than the mining process itself), determining when a block is to be generated. Additionally, this paper presents a proof-of-storage scheme for rewarding users that provide storage for the deep learning models, as well as a theoretical dissertation on how the mechanics of the system could be articulated with the ultimate goal of democratizing access to artificial intelligence.", "The present study uses a review of the literature and the views of tourism and management professors and experts in order to the identification of organizational intelligence elements in tourism management (STO) for the first time. The census method was used to determine the research sample and the Delphi technique was used to design the questionnaire. Construct divergence was then used to determine the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The final results indicated that providing e-services for tourists had the greatest impact on the development of STO (loading factor: 0.677). Moreover, New Tourism Marketing Methods (NTMM) had the least effect on the development of STO (loading factor: 0.431). Overall, the most important achievement of the present research is introducing the concept of STO in tourism management.", "Infancy is the period of greatest neuroplasticity. The early detection of developmental disorders helps to provide a timely intervention aimed at reducing sequelae and/or complications.\nTo assess psychomotor and cognitive development in infants between 6 and 9 months old assisted in the public health sector.\nDescriptive study with follow-up of full-term infants who were clinically healthy at the time of assessment and had an adequate weight, height, and head circumference for their age. The Assessment Scale of Psychomotor Development and the Argentine Scale of Sensorimotor Intelligence were used in infants aged 6-9 months. Early stimulation was the intervention provided to those who showed a risk or delay. The prevalence of risk/delay of psychomotor development and sensorimotor intelligence was determined. The statistical software package R, version 3.3.1 was used.\nA total of 102 children were assessed. At 6 months old, 22.5 % had a developmental risk/delay. The prevalence of unexpected results for age in psychomotor development and sensorimotor intelligence was 13.7 % and 16.7 %, respectively. These children received early stimulation and all showed improved results. At 9 months old, the prevalence of risk/delay was 20.6 %: 14.7 % in psychomotor development and 9.8 % in sensorimotor intelligence.\nAt 6 months old, 22.5 % of infants had a developmental risk/delay; at 9 months old, this prevalence was 20.6 %.

However, robotics in fracture reduction remains at the infant stage. As essential components of the current robotic system, external fixators were used in fracture reduction, including the unilateral and Ilizarov-like ring fixators. With emerging of the industrial robots and mechanical arms, their sterilized variants were developed as the serial robots, including the traction device and robotic arm, for fracture reduction. Besides, parallel robots (e.g., Gough-Stewart platform) were devised for lower extremity traction and fracture reduction. After combining the advantages of the serial and parallel mechanisms, hybrid robots can fulfill specific clinical requirements (e.g., the joint fracture, including multiple major fragments). Furthermore, with the aid of intra-operative navigation systems, fracture reduction can be performed under real-time guidance. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the advancement of the robots in fracture reduction\u00a0and evaluates research challenges and future perspectives, including ergonomic and economic issues, operation time, artificial realities and intelligence, and telesurgery.", "A high maternal prepregnancy body mass index has been associated with lower offspring IQ, but it is unclear if the relationship is causal. To explore this, our objectives were to compare maternal and paternal estimates and to assess whether certain factors mediate the association.\nWe analysed data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, which initially recruited 14\u2009541 women residing in Avon, UK, with an expected date of delivery in 1991-1992. Data were collected during and after pregnancy by questionnaire, medical record abstraction and clinical assessment. At approximately 8 years of age, psychologists administered an abbreviated form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III. We fit multivariable logistic regression models to estimate parental prepregnancy obesity and overweight-offspring IQ associations. Counterfactually defined indirect (mediated) effects of maternal prepregnancy obesity on offspring IQ were estimated through path analysis.\nAmong 4324 mother-father-child triads and using normal weight as the referent, we observed consistently stronger associations for maternal prepregnancy obesity and offspring performance IQ (eg, adjusted \u03b2 (95%\u2009CI)=-3.4 (-5.7 to -1.2) vs -0.97 (-2.9 to 0.96) for paternal obesity). The indirect effects of maternal obesity on offspring IQ through pathways involving gestational weight gain and duration of breastfeeding were small but significant.\nOur findings are consistent with a weak biologic effect of maternal adiposity in pregnancy on offspring performance IQ. Given the growing prevalence of obesity worldwide, more evidence is needed to resolve the correlation versus causation debate in this area.", "Venture Capital (VC) funding raised by companies producing Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) solutions is on the rise and a driver of technology development. In healthcare, VC funding is distributed unevenly and certain technologies have attracted significantly more funding than others have. We analyzed a database of 106 Healthcare AI companies collected from open online sources to understand factors affecting the VC funding of AI companies operating in different areas of healthcare. The results suggest that there is a significant connection between higher funding and having research organizations or pharmaceutical companies as the customer of the product or service. In addition, focusing on AI solutions that are applied to direct patient care delivery is associated with lower funding. We discuss the implications of our findings for public health technology funding institutions.", "Intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) exhibits high variability across individuals, which may account for the diversity of cognitive and behavioural ability. This variability in connectivity could be attributed to individual-specific trait and inter-session state differences (intra-subject differences), as well as a small amount of noise. However, it is still a challenge to perform accurate identification of connectivity traits from FC. Here, we introduced a novel low-rank learning model to solve this problem with a new constraint item that could reduce intra-subject differences. The model could dissociate FC into a substrate (substrate) that delineates functional characteristics common across the population and connectivity traits that are expected to account for individual behavioural differences. Subsequently, we performed a sparse dictionary learning algorithm on the extracted connectivity traits and obtained a dictionary matrix, named connectivity dictionary. We could then predict cognitive behaviours, including fluid intelligence, oral reading recognition, grip strength and anger-aggression, more accurately using the connectivity dictionary than the original FC. The results reflect that we captured individual connectivity traits that more effectively represent cognitive behaviour. Moreover, we found that the functional substrate is significantly correlated with large-scale anatomical brain architecture, and individual differences in connectivity traits are constrained by the connectivity substrate. Our findings may advance our understanding of the relationships among anatomy, function, and behaviour.", "Tools to quantify layperson assessments of facial palsy are lacking. In this study, artificial intelligence was applied to develop a proxy for layperson assessments, and compare sensitivity to existing outcome measures.\nArtificially intelligent emotion detection software was used to develop the emotionality quotient. The emotionality quotient was defined as the percentage probability of perceived joy over the percentage probability of perceived negative emotions during smiling, as predicted by the software. The emotionality quotient was used to analyze the emotionality of voluntary smiles of normal subjects and unilateral facial palsy patients before and after smile reanimation. The emotionality quotient was compared to oral commissure excursion and layperson assessments of facial palsy patients.\nIn voluntary smiles of 10 normal subjects, 100 percent joy and no negative emotion was detected (interquartile ranges, 0/1). Median preoperative emotionality quotient of 30 facial palsy patients was 15/-60 (interquartile range, 73/62). Postoperatively, median emotionality quotient was 84/0 (interquartile range, 28/5). In 134 smile reanimation patients, no correlation was found between postoperative oral commissure excursion and emotionality quotient score. However, in 61 preoperative patients, a moderate correlation was found between layperson-assessed disfigurement and negative emotion perception (correlation coefficient, 0.516; p < 0.001).\nComputer vision artificial intelligence software detected less joy and more negative emotion in smiles of facial palsy patients compared with normal subjects. Following smile reanimation, significantly more joy and less negative emotion were detected. The emotionality quotient was correlated with layperson assessments. The simplicity, sensitivity, and objectivity of the emotionality quotient render it an attractive tool to serve as a potential proxy for layperson assessment, an ideal outcome measure in facial palsy.\nDiagnostic, IV.", "A hybrid artificial intelligence model and optimization algorithm could be a powerful approach for modeling and optimizing plant tissue culture procedures. The aim of this study was introducing an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System- Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (ANFIS-NSGAII) as a powerful computational methodology for somatic embryogenesis of chrysanthemum, as a case study. ANFIS was used for modeling three outputs including callogenesis frequency (CF), embryogenesis frequency (EF), and the number of somatic embryo (NSE) based on different variables including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), sucrose, glucose, fructose, and light quality. Subsequently, models were linked to NSGAII for optimizing the process, and the importance of each input was evaluated by sensitivity analysis. Results showed that all of the R2 of training and testing sets were over 92%, indicating the efficiency and accuracy of ANFIS on the modeling of the embryogenesis. Also, according to ANFIS-NSGAII, optimal EF (99.1%), and NSE (13.1) can be obtained from a medium containing 1.53 mg/L 2,4-D, 1.67 mg/L BAP, 13.74 g/L sucrose, 57.20 g/L glucose, and 0.39 g/L fructose under red light. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that embryogenesis was more sensitive to 2,4-D, and less sensitive to fructose. Generally, the hybrid ANFIS-NSGAII can be recognized as a powerful computational tool for modeling and optimizing in plant tissue culture.", "Metal exposure is a public health hazard due to neurocognitive effects starting in early life. Poor socio-economic status, adverse home and family environment can enhance the neurodevelopmental toxicity due to chemical exposure. Disadvantaged socio-economic conditions are generally higher in environmentally impacted areas although the combined effect of these two factors has not been sufficiently studied.\nThe effect of co-exposure to neurotoxic metals including arsenic, cadmium, manganese, mercury, lead, selenium, and to socio-economic stressors was assessed in a group of 299 children aged 6-12\u2009years, residing at incremental distance from industrial emissions in Taranto, Italy. Exposure was assessed with biological monitoring and the distance between the home address and the exposure point source. Children's cognitive functions were examined using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Linear mixed models were chosen to assess the association between metal exposure, socio-economic status and neurocognitive outcomes.\nUrinary arsenic, cadmium and hair manganese resulted inversely related to the distance from the industrial emission source (\u03b2 -\u20090.04; 95% CI -0.06, -\u20090.01; \u03b2 -\u20090.02; 95% CI -0.05, -\u20090.001; \u03b2 -\u20090.02 95% CI -0.05, -\u20090.003) while the WISC intellectual quotient and its sub-scores (except processing speed index) showed a positive association with distance. Blood lead and urinary cadmium were negatively associated with the IQ total score and all sub-scores, although not reaching the significance level. Hair manganese and blood lead was positively associated with the CANTAB between errors of spatial working memory (\u03b2 2.2; 95% CI 0.3, 3.9) and the reaction time of stop signal task (\u03b2 0.05; 95% CI 0.02, 0.1) respectively. All the other CANTAB neurocognitive tests did not show to be significantly influenced by metal exposure. The highest socio-economic status showed about five points intellectual quotient more than the lowest level on average (\u03b2 4.8; 95% CI 0.3, 9.6); the interaction term between blood lead and the socio-economic status showed a significant negative impact of lead on working memory at the lowest socio-economic status level (\u03b2 -\u20094.0; 95% CI -6.9, -\u20091.1).\nMetal exposure and the distance from industrial emission was associated with negative cognitive impacts in these children. Lead exposure had neurocognitive effect even at very low levels of blood lead concentration when socio-economic status is low, and this should further address the importance and prioritize preventive and regulatory interventions.", "Current taxonomies of intelligence comprise two factors of mental speed, clerical speed (Gs), and elementary cognitive speed (Gt). Both originated from different research traditions and are conceptualized as dissociable constructs in current taxonomies. However, previous research suggests that tasks of one category can be transferred into the other category by simply changing the mode of administration, i.e., in form of a paper-and-pencil test or in from of a computer-based elementary cognitive task. However, cross-mode correlations for specific tasks are usually only moderate. In the present study, mental speed was assessed as a broad construct across different tasks and stimulus materials. This allowed modeling mental speed as a hierarchical construct for paper-and-pencil as well as for computer-based tests. Cross-mode correlations of the respective general factors were moderate (r = 0.64), while the cross-mode correlations of task-specific components depended on task type (r = 0.12 to r = 0.71). Only the g factors of mental speed, but not the task-specific components, were found to be related with working memory capacity as a marker of cognitive ability. The speed general factor modeled across computer-based tests was more highly correlated with working memory capacity (r = 0.66) than the general factor modeled across paper-and-pencil tests (r = 0.46). These findings corroborate a crucial role of the assessment method and imply that validity of speed tests is affected by the choice of the test format.", "This study aimed to test a structural model to examine the protective role of psychosocial variables, such as social support, emotional intelligence and their interaction, on the cognitive dimension of subjective positive well-being (life satisfaction) and negative well-being (depression) in Moroccan adolescents. The participants consisted of 1277 students (571 men, 694 women and 12 missing values) with a mean age of 16.15 years (SD = 2.22; range = 9 to 23) who attended 26 public schools in different territories of Morocco. These students were in secondary education (n = 893) and high school (n = 378) (6 missing values). The scales for measuring the variables of interest had to be adapted and validated as a previous step for the further proposal of a model of relations. Statistical analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the proposed model. The model that optimally adjusted the data confirmed the protective role of social support in the well-being of Moroccan adolescents. Consistent with previous studies, social support was directly related to well-being. However, it also modulated levels of satisfaction with life. Likewise, the inclusion of emotional intelligence as an additional protective factor contributed to the explanation of the well-being mechanisms in adolescents. In addition to direct associations with the levels of social support, satisfaction with life and depression (negative in the latter case), emotional intelligence participated in a complex chain affecting life satisfaction and life satisfaction affecting depression. Moreover, the interaction of emotional intelligence with social support was confirmed to determine levels of life satisfaction in adolescents. Specifically, social support multiplied the effects of the relationship between satisfaction with life and emotional intelligence in cases of moderate and high levels in Moroccan adolescents. This study fills a gap in the literature by adapting and further analyzing several scales with Moroccan samples of adolescents and by proposing and verifying a relational model that can help researchers and teachers to more precisely clarify these relations according to their context. The enhancement of protective factors, such as social support and emotional intelligence, will promote healthy youth development, thus creating healthier societies in the future.", "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are rapidly changing practice across different tumor settings. With this article, we reflect on how to assimilate the tsunami of ICIs data into clinical practice.\nA tremendous increase on approvals, number of publications, and clinical trials ongoing with ICIs on many different tumor types.\nICIs are innovative treatments that are showing a significant benefit on different tumors. More approvals and an explosive increase of knowledge around the usage of ICI are to be expected in the near future, bringing new challenges on how to integrate this fast-growing evidence with ICI into clinical practice. To be updated, oncologists could follow approved guidelines from relevant societies and complement it with an appropriate search from publication databases. There are also some available courses, conferences and online material that are useful to improve knowledge in this so rapidly changing environment. In the future, we believe the integration of artificial intelligence and learning machines will play an important role to facilitate best clinical practices in different fields of medicine but particularly for oncology.", "Modern network science techniques are popularly used to characterize the functional organization of the brain. A major challenge in network neuroscience is to understand how functional characteristics and topological architecture are related in the brain. Previous task-based functional neuroimaging studies have uncovered a core set of brain regions (e.g., frontal and parietal) supporting diverse cognitive tasks. However, the graph representation of functional diversity of brain regions remains to be understood.\nHere, we present a novel graph measure, the neighbor dispersion index, to test the hypothesis that the functional diversity of a brain region is embodied by the topological dissimilarity of its immediate neighbors in the large-scale functional brain network.\nWe consistently identified in two independent and publicly accessible resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets that brain regions in the frontoparietal and salience networks showed higher neighbor dispersion index, whereas those in the visual, auditory, and sensorimotor networks showed lower neighbor dispersion index. Moreover, we observed that human fluid intelligence was associated with the neighbor dispersion index of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while no such association for the other metrics commonly used for characterizing network hubs was noticed even with an uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a0.05.\nThis newly developed graph theoretical method offers fresh insight into the topological organization of functional brain networks and also sheds light on individual differences in human intelligence.", "Migraine headache is classified as acute or chronic. In recent years, efforts have been made to identify the factors that might predispose individuals to develop the chronic-type headache. The present study aimed to draw a comparison between patients with acute and chronic migraine in terms of demographic, pain-related, and psychological variables. In addition, we also investigated factors affecting headache chronicity in such patients.\nThe present cross-sectional study was conducted during 2017-2018. The target sample consisted of 250 patients with acute or chronic migraine who referred to various clinics affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (SUMS), Shiraz, Iran, recruited by convenience sampling. All the participants filled in the questionnaires related to demographic characteristics, pain intensity, disability, depression, emotional intelligence, and anger. The data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 22.0) with t test, Chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nPatients suffering from chronic migraine experienced higher levels of disability, depression, anger, and had lower levels of emotional intelligence compared to those with acute migraine. Based on the logistic regression analysis, variables that had a significant effect on headache chronicity were female gender (OR=5.81), married status (OR=3.77), patients with lower level of education (OR=0.26), headache duration (OR=1.53), disability (OR=0.28), depression (OR=3.66), and anger (OR=5.04).\nVariables such as disability, depression, and lack of anger control were among the key factors associated with headache chronicity in migraine patients.", "Human intelligence can be broadly subdivided into fluid (gf) and crystallized (gc) intelligence, each tapping into distinct cognitive abilities. Although neuroanatomical correlates of intelligence have been previously studied, differential contribution of cortical morphologies to gf and gc has not been fully delineated. Here, we tried to disentangle the contribution of cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and cortical gyrification to gf and gc in a large sample of healthy young subjects (n\u00a0=\u2009740, Human Connectome Project) with high-resolution MRIs, followed by replication in a separate data set with distinct cognitive measures indexing gf and gc. We found that while gyrification in distributed cortical regions had positive association with both gf and gc, surface area and thickness showed more regional associations. Specifically, higher performance in gf was associated with cortical expansion in regions related to working memory, attention, and visuo-spatial processing, while gc was associated with thinner cortex as well as higher cortical surface area in language-related networks. We discuss the results in a framework where \"horizontal\" cortical expansion enables higher resource allocation, computational capacity, and functional specificity relevant to gf and gc, while lower cortical thickness possibly reflects cortical pruning facilitating \"vertical\" intracolumnar efficiency in knowledge-based tasks relevant mostly to gc.", "The use of artificial intelligence and robotics in health care means ethical principles need to be established. Artificial and human intelligence must be implemented in such as way as to complement each other. From humanism to anthropotechnics, the definitions of human and humanism are not set in stone. A philosophical reflection can enable their definition to be shaped.", "Pattern classification and stratification approaches have increasingly been used in research on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) over the last ten years with the goal of translation towards clinical applicability. Here, we present an extensive scoping literature review on those two approaches. We screened a total of 635 studies, of which 57 pattern classification and 19 stratification studies were included. We observed large variance across pattern classification studies in terms of predictive performance from about 60% to 98% accuracy, which is among other factors likely linked to sampling bias, different validation procedures across studies, the heterogeneity of ASD and differences in data quality. Stratification studies were less prevalent with only two studies reporting replications and just a few showing external validation. While some identified strata based on cognition and intelligence reappear across studies, biology as a stratification marker is clearly underexplored. In summary, mapping biological differences at the level of the individual with ASD is a major challenge for the field now. Conceptualizing those mappings and individual trajectories that lead to the diagnosis of ASD, will become a major challenge in the near future.", "When the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ) declared the end of the challenge to the Japanese Shogi Association in 2015, the belief was that it would take more than 20 years for computers to catch up with human professional Go players, as Go is far more complex than shogi from a combinatorial perspective. However, AlphaGo, whose paper was just published the same year, beat the Go world champion in all three games in 2017. In this paper, we describe the artificial intelligence methods adopted by AlphaGo, especially deep learning, and consider their relationship with neuroscience.", "Radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer offers excellent long-term outcomes for patients with high-risk disease. The increased risk of pelvic nodal involvement in this cohort has led to the development of whole-pelvis radiotherapy (WPRT) with a prostate boost. However, the use of WPRT remains controversial. Data are mixed, but advanced radiotherapy techniques enable delivery of increased radiation to pelvic nodes with acceptable levels of toxicity. Contemporary imaging modalities with increased sensitivity for detecting subclinical lymph node disease will facilitate selection of patients most likely to benefit from WPRT. Using such modalities for image guidance of advanced radiotherapy techniques could also permit high-dose delivery to nodes outside the conventional Radiation Therapy Oncology Group volumes, where magnetic resonance lymphography and single-photon-emission CT imaging have mapped a high frequency of microscopic disease. With increased toxicity a concern, an alternative to WPRT would be selective irradiation of target nodal groups most likely to harbour occult disease. New image-based 'big data' mining techniques enable the large-scale comparison of incidental dose distributions of thousands of patients treated in the past. By using novel computing methods and artificial intelligence, high-risk regions can be identified and used to optimize WPRT through refined knowledge of the likely location of subclinical disease.", "BackgroundManagement of thyroid nodules may be inconsistent between different observers and time consuming for radiologists. An artificial intelligence system that uses deep learning may improve radiology workflow for management of thyroid nodules.PurposeTo develop a deep learning algorithm that uses thyroid US images to decide whether a thyroid nodule should undergo a biopsy and to compare the performance of the algorithm with the performance of radiologists who adhere to American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS).Materials and MethodsIn this retrospective analysis, studies in patients referred for US with subsequent fine-needle aspiration or with surgical histologic analysis used as the standard were evaluated. The study period was from August 2006 to May 2010. A multitask deep convolutional neural network was trained to provide biopsy recommendations for thyroid nodules on the basis of two orthogonal US images as the input. In the training phase, the deep learning algorithm was first evaluated by using 10-fold cross-validation. Internal validation was then performed on an independent set of 99 consecutive nodules. The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were compared with a consensus of three ACR TI-RADS committee experts and nine other radiologists, all of whom interpreted thyroid US images in clinical practice.ResultsIncluded were 1377 thyroid nodules in 1230 patients with complete imaging data and conclusive cytologic or histologic diagnoses. For the 99 test nodules, the proposed deep learning algorithm achieved 13 of 15 (87%: 95% confidence interval [CI]: 67%, 100%) sensitivity, the same as expert consensus (P > .99) and higher than five of nine radiologists. The specificity of the deep learning algorithm was 44 of 84 (52%; 95% CI: 42%, 62%), which was similar to expert consensus (43 of 84; 51%; 95% CI: 41%, 62%; P = .91) and higher than seven of nine other radiologists. The mean sensitivity and specificity for the nine radiologists was 83% (95% CI: 64%, 98%) and 48% (95% CI: 37%, 59%), respectively.ConclusionSensitivity and specificity of a deep learning algorithm for thyroid nodule biopsy recommendations was similar to that of expert radiologists who used American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging and Reporting Data System guidelines.\u00a9 RSNA, 2019Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "Prospective enrollment of research subjects in the fast-paced emergency department (ED) is challenging. We sought to develop a software application to increase real-time clinical trial enrollment during an ED visit. The Prospective Intelligence System for Clinical Emergency Services (PISCES) scans the electronic health record during ED encounters for preselected clinical characteristics of potentially eligible study participants and notifies the treating physician via mobile phone text alerts. PISCES alerts began 3 months into a cluster randomized trial of an electronic health record-based risk stratification tool for pediatric abdominal pain in 11 Northern California EDs. We compared aggregate enrollment before (2577 eligible patients, October 2016 to December 2016) and after (12 049 eligible patients, January 2017 to January 2018) PISCES implementation. Enrollment increased from 10.8% to 21.1% following PISCES implementations (P\u2009<\u2009.001). PISCES significantly increased study enrollment and can serve as a valuable tool to assist prospective research enrollment in the ED.", "The science of judgment and decision making involves three interrelated forms of research: analysis of the decisions people face, description of their natural responses, and interventions meant to help them do better. After briefly introducing the field's intellectual foundations, we review recent basic research into the three core elements of decision making: judgment, or how people predict the outcomes that will follow possible choices; preference, or how people weigh those outcomes; and choice, or how people combine judgments and preferences to reach a decision. We then review research into two potential sources of behavioral heterogeneity: individual differences in decision-making competence and developmental changes across the life span. Next, we illustrate applications intended to improve individual and organizational decision making in health, public policy, intelligence analysis, and risk management. We emphasize the potential value of coupling analytical and behavioral research and having basic and applied research inform one another.", "A considerable amount of research has been devoted to understanding individual differences in lexical learning, however, the majority of this research has been conducted with spoken languages rather than signed languages and thus we know very little about the cognitive processes involved in sign learning or the extent to which lexical learning processes are specific to word learning. The present study was conducted to address this gap. Two-hundred thirty-six non-signing adults completed 25 tasks assessing word learning and sign learning (via associative learning paradigms) as well as modality-specific phonological short-term memory, working memory capacity, crystallized intelligence, and fluid intelligence. Latent variable analyses indicated that, when other variables were held constant, fluid intelligence was predictive of both word and sign learning, however, modality-specific phonological short-term memory factors were only predictive of lexical learning within modality-none of the other variables made significant independent contributions. It was further observed that sign and word learning were strongly correlated. Exploratory analyses revealed that all lexical learning tasks loaded onto a general factor, however, sign learning tasks loaded onto an additional specific factor. As such, this study provides insight into the cognitive components that are common to associative L2 lexical learning regardless of language modality and those that are unique to either signed or spoken languages. Results are further discussed in light of established and more recent theories of intelligence, short-term memory, and working memory.", "Clinical trials consume the latter half of the 10 to 15 year, 1.5-2.0 billion USD, development cycle for bringing a single new drug to market. Hence, a failed trial sinks not only the investment into the trial itself but also the preclinical development costs, rendering the loss per failed clinical trial at 800 million to 1.4 billion USD. Suboptimal patient cohort selection and recruiting techniques, paired with the inability to monitor patients effectively during trials, are two of the main causes for high trial failure rates: only one of 10 compounds entering a clinical trial reaches the market. We explain how recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to reshape key steps of clinical trial design towards increasing trial success rates.", "Prognosis of the aged population requiring maintenance dialysis has been reportedly poor. We aimed to develop prediction models for one-year cost and one-year mortality in aged individuals requiring dialysis to assist decision-making for deciding whether aged people should receive dialysis or not.\nWe used data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). We identified patients first enrolled in the NHIRD from 2000-2011 for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent regular dialysis. A total of 48,153 Patients with ESRD aged \u226565 years with complete age and sex information were included in the ESRD cohort. The total medical cost per patient (measured in US dollars) within one year after ESRD diagnosis was our study's main outcome variable. We were also concerned with mortality as another outcome. In this study, we compared the performance of the random forest prediction model and of the artificial neural network prediction model for predicting patient cost and mortality.\nIn the cost regression model, the random forest model outperforms the artificial neural network according to the mean squared error and mean absolute error. In the mortality classification model, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of both models were significantly better than the null hypothesis area of 0.5, and random forest model outperformed the artificial neural network. Random forest model outperforms the artificial neural network models achieved similar performance in the test set across all data.\nApplying artificial intelligence modeling could help to provide reliable information about one-year outcomes following dialysis in the aged and super-aged populations; those with cancer, alcohol-related disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), previous hip fracture, osteoporosis, dementia, and previous respiratory failure had higher medical costs and a high mortality rate.", "Magnifying endoscopy with narrow band imaging (M-NBI) has been applied to examine early gastric cancer by observing microvascular architecture and microsurface structure of gastric mucosal lesions. However, the diagnostic efficacy of non-experts in differentiating early gastric cancer from non-cancerous lesions by M-NBI remained far from satisfactory. In this study, we developed a new system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze gastric mucosal lesions observed by M-NBI.\nA total of 386 images of non-cancerous lesions and 1702 images of early gastric cancer were collected to train and establish a CNN model (Inception-v3). Then a total of 341 endoscopic images (171 non-cancerous lesions and 170 early gastric cancer) were selected to evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of CNN and endoscopists. Primary outcome measures included diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.\nThe sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CNN system in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer were 91.18%, 90.64%, and 90.91%, respectively. No significant difference was spotted in the specificity and accuracy of diagnosis between CNN and experts. However, the diagnostic sensitivity of CNN was significantly higher than that of the experts. Furthermore, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CNN were significantly higher than those of the non-experts.\nOur CNN system showed high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of early gastric cancer. It is anticipated that more progress will be made in optimization of the CNN diagnostic system and further development of artificial intelligence in the medical field.", "Environmental lead exposure is associated with cognitive impairment in healthy children, with deficits seen in intelligence quotient (IQ), attention, and behavior. Neurocognitive dysfunction is also a well-described complication among children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The objective was to evaluate the association between blood lead levels (BLL) and performance on neurocognitive assessments in a cohort of children with CKD.\nCross-sectional study of children with mild to moderate CKD from the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) multicenter prospective cohort study. The primary exposure was BLL. The primary outcome was performance on age-specific neurocognitive assessments evaluating IQ, executive functioning, attention, hyperactivity, and behavior. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate the association between BLL and neurocognitive performance, adjusted for key sociodemographic and clinical variables.\nA total of 412 subjects were included with median age 15.4\u00a0years, median estimated GFR 39\u00a0mL/min/1.732, median BLL 1.2\u00a0mcg/dL, and median IQ score 99. In multivariable linear regression, higher BLL was associated with significantly lower IQ score (-\u20092.1 IQ points for every 1-mcg/dL increase in BLL, p\u2009=\u20090.029). Higher BLL was associated with worse scores on the Conners' Continuous Performance Test II Variability T-Score, a measure of inattention (+\u20091.8 T-Score points for every 1-mcg/dL increase in BLL, p\u2009=\u20090.033).\nLow-level lead exposure is associated with significantly lower IQ and more inattention in children with CKD, a population already at high risk for neurocognitive dysfunction. Universal screening for elevated BLL should be considered for all children with CKD at age 12-24\u00a0months.", "Access to big data analyzed by supercomputers using advanced mathematical algorithms (i.e., deep machine learning) has allowed for enhancement of cognitive output (i.e., visual imaging interpretation) to previously unseen levels and promises to fundamentally change the practice of medicine. This field, known as \"artificial intelligence\" (AI), is making significant progress in areas such as automated clinical decision making, medical imaging analysis, and interventional procedures, and has the potential to dramatically influence the practice of interventional cardiology. The unique nature of interventional cardiology makes it an ideal target for the development of AI-based technologies designed to improve real-time clinical decision making, streamline workflow in the catheterization laboratory, and standardize catheter-based procedures through advanced robotics. This review provides an introduction to AI by highlighting its scope, potential\u00a0applications, and limitations in interventional cardiology.", "Trait Emotional Intelligence (trait EI) is a constellation of correlated emotion-related traits that capture an individual's typical way of processing emotion-related information and reacting in emotional situations. Numerous studies have shown that trait EI is a significant predictor of both subjective and objective health. This correlational meta-analysis (k\u2009=\u2009106, N\u2009=\u200945,262) aims to explore the behavioural and biological variables that could account for these effects. It also aims to provide a roadmap for future research by identifying what should be studied (pinpointing dead-end roads and promising paths) and how (methodological improvements needed to draw stronger conclusions). The results revealed large associations of trait EI with social support, sleep quality, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in challenging situations as well as medium associations with dietary habits, physical activity, and substance use. Other candidate pathways have given rise to much less research. Based on both theoretical predictions and preliminary findings, the paper categorises these pathways as promising or not promising. Future research would benefit from using more diverse samples, measuring behavioural variables more objectively, controlling for personality, and systematically examining to what extent changes in EI (e.g., following training) lead to changes in behaviours and/or biological parameters.", "Salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) has shown good potential in the diagnosis of primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS). However, a series of international studies have reported needs for improvements of the existing pSS scoring procedures in terms of inter/intra observer reliability before being established as standardized diagnostic tools. The present study aims to solve this problem by employing radiomics features and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to make the pSS scoring more objective and faster compared to human expert scoring. The assessment of AI algorithms was performed on a two-centric cohort, which included 600 SGUS images (150 patients) annotated using the original SGUS scoring system proposed in 1992 for pSS. For each image, we extracted 907 histogram-based and descriptive statistics features from segmented salivary glands. Optimal feature subsets were found using the genetic algorithm based wrapper approach. Among the considered algorithms (seven classifiers and five regressors), the best preforming was the multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier (\u03ba = 0.7). The MLP over-performed average score achieved by the clinicians (\u03ba = 0.67) by the considerable margin, whereas its reliability was on the level of human intra-observer variability (\u03ba = 0.71). The presented findings indicate that the continuously increasing HarmonicSS cohort will enable further advancements in AI-based pSS scoring methods by SGUS. In turn, this may establish SGUS as an effective noninvasive pSS diagnostic tool, with the final goal to supplement current diagnostic tests.", "With the continuous progress of virtual simulation technology, medical surgery visualization system has been developed from two-dimensional to three-dimensional, from digital to network and intelligentization. The visualization system with mixed reality technology will also be used in all stage of medical surgery, such as case discussion, surgical planning, intraoperative guidance, post-operative evaluation, rehabilitation, so as to further promote high intelligence, high precision of medical surgery, and consequently improve effectiveness of treatment and quality of medical service. This paper discusses the composition and technical characteristics of medical operation visualization system based on mixed reality technology, and introduces some typical applications of mixed reality technology in medical operation visualization, which provides a new perspective for the application of mixed technology in medical surgery.", "Emotional intelligence is intrinsically associated with the ability to understand, manage, and express feelings and deal with other people's emotions. This competence is essential for the formation, development, and maintenance of personal and professional relationships. Furthermore, emotional intelligence can be extensively worked out and developed over time, which allows each individual to become a better professional. Nevertheless, the perception that higher education students have about the importance of emotional intelligence remains residual and there are few contexts that allow them to develop emotional intelligence skills. In this sense, this study proposes the use of a serious game to assess and develop emotional intelligence skills in the context of an entrepreneurship discipline attended by multidisciplinary students from the courses of management and computer engineering. The performance of students is measured and discussed considering a mixed methods approach. The findings indicate the existence of a correlation between the player's emotional intelligence skills and his performance in the game, and this occurrence is common to students regardless of their course, gender, age, and number of years of professional experience. The study also explores the importance of emotional intelligence considering the distinct profile of students.", "\"Mindsets (or implicit theories) are people's lay beliefs about the nature of human attributes, such as intelligence or personality\". Individuals with a fixed mindset believe that intelligence is an unchangeable trait, whereas those with a growth mindset think of it as a malleable quality that can be increased and developed. This study explored the relationships among growth mindset, wellbeing, and performance in a sample of 1,240 students from a multi-campus private university located in 18 states across Mexico. Our results indicated that individuals who scored high in growth (vs. fixed) mindset showed increased levels of wellbeing and also performed better in school. Furthermore, we found that wellbeing mediated the relationship between growth mindset and performance and that the effect of growth mindset on grades was higher among younger students. These findings have interesting implications for psychology and education.", "It is commonly assumed that a person's emotional state can be readily inferred from his or her facial movements, typically called emotional expressions or facial expressions. This assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people actually move their faces to express emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from facial movements in situations of everyday life. This research is crucial to provide consumers of emotion research with the translational information they require.", "The specific role of emotional intelligence (EI) in the field of plastic surgery has not been investigated. We aim to investigate the relationship between EI and the individual components of burnout among plastic surgery residents in Saudi Arabia.\nIn this cross-sectional study, all plastic surgery residents (n = 37) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were invited to participate in a questionnaire based study in March 2018. The survey contained a validated measure of burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey), validated measure of EI (Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form), and evaluated residents' demographics, professional and personal risk factors, and career satisfaction.\nThe overall rate of high burnout was 37.9%, with 72.4% residents reporting high level of emotional exhaustion (EE), 41% reporting high depersonalization (DP) and 41% reporting low sense of personal accomplishment (PA). EI has shown to have a significant negative relationship with EE (95% confidence interval CI, -9.061 to -1.374; P = 0.010), DP (95% CI, -5.747 to -1.974; P < 0.001), and a significant positive correlation with PA (95% CI, 1.398-5.439; P = 0.002). Significant risk factors for burnout included dissatisfaction with plastic surgery as a career choice, dissatisfaction with income, and dissatisfaction with the role in the operating room (P < 0.05).\nWe found a positive correlation between higher levels of EI and sense of personal achievement, whereas a negative correlation was observed between higher level of EI and EE and DP among the residents in this study. Plastic surgery residents who are satisfied with their salary have lower EE and DP. Residents who are satisfied with their role in the operating room have a better sense of PA.", "Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is associated with a significant morbidity. There is the need to investigate long-term cognitive outcome among ARDS survivors treated with VV-ECMO. We aimed to compare the prevalence of long-term cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychological impairment using a highly specific test in severe ARDS survivors treated or not treated with VV-ECMO.\nSevere ARDS survivors treated between 2011 and 2017 in an ECMO Regional Referral Center were prospectively evaluated 2\u00a0years after their ICU discharge. Patients underwent an in-person interview and examination. The primary outcome was cognitive function, assessed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 4th edition (WAIS-IV). Secondary outcomes included anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and quality-of-life.\nWe investigated 40 consecutive patients surviving from severe ARDS treated (N\u2009=\u200922) or not (N\u2009=\u200918) with VV-ECMO at a median [interquartile range] of 20 [17-22] and 22 [18-23] months after ICU discharge, respectively. Regarding the main outcome, cognitive function was below normal ranges in 12 (55%) ECMO patients and 10 (56%) non-ECMO patients (p\u2009=\u20090.95). Eight (36%) ECMO patients had moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms as compared with 7 (39%) non-ECMO patients (p\u2009=\u20090.87). Twelve (55%) ECMO patients and eight (44%) non-ECMO patients had moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms (p\u2009=\u20090.53). Seven (33%) ECMO patients and eight (44%) non-ECMO patients presented a PTSD (p\u2009=\u20090.48). Health-related quality of life did not differ between the two groups.\nUsing the WAIS-IV, VV-ECMO treatment does not appear to worsen long-term cognitive and neuropsychological outcomes in severe ARDS patients.", "Changes in the olfactory ability are one of early symptoms of developing neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In a healthy population olfactory function is characterized by independence from an intelligence quotient and various cognitive functions, e.g., memory. The peak of the olfactory ability falls between 20 and 40 years of age. In the geriatric population the worsening of the olfactory ability is found. Because of it, the knowledge on differences between the changes associated with physiological aging and the symptoms indicating pathological changes in the brain is of clinical importance. In this article, neuroanatomical structures of the olfactory tract and their involutionary changes, which may contribute to age-related olfactory deterioration, are discussed. Data are presented on the frequency of olfactory dysfunction occurrence, sex differences in the olfactory ability, and characteristics of its worsening among the elderly. Furthermore, age-related changes in odor memory are reviewed. The authors suggest that the main criterion allowing for differentiation between a physiological and pathological smell loss is awareness/unawareness of the deficit in this domain.", "eHealth support for oncological therapy management has different faces. In addition to the direct support of therapy-supportive measures such as the promotion of physical activities, monitoring of the diet and observation of the quality of life through eHealth approaches are possible. Many solutions are now in transition between research and routine use. The most substantial evidence today is in the area of symptom monitoring. Independent studies have shown a significant survival benefit among other advantages as well. There is also a good overlap in eHealth and physical activity. More and more solutions are coming onto the market, which also has an impact for cancer patients. In the field of nutrition, there are only a few successful approaches both within and outside oncology. In contrast, the application of eHealth for the detection of disease-related malnutrition seems promising. Innovative approaches involving \"artificial intelligence\" or \"Internet of Things\" are slowly finding their place in both research and routine. For routine care, it will be necessary for doctors, nurses, and patients to know what a real medical eHealth application is and which are just lifestyle products without the needed quality for professional medical usage.", "Objective: Embedded validity measures are useful in neuropsychological evaluations but should be updated with new test versions and validated across various samples. This study evaluated Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th edition (WAIS-IV) Digit Span validity indicators in post-deployment veterans.Method: Neurologically-intact veterans completed structured diagnostic interviews, the WAIS-IV, the Medical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT), and the b Test as part of a larger study. The Noncredible group included individuals who failed either the MSVT or the b Test. Of the total sample (N\u2009=\u2009275), 21.09% failed the MSVT and/or b Test. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated predicting group status across cutoff scores on two Digit Span variables, four Reliable Digit Span (RDS) variables, and two Vocabulary minus Digit Span variables.Results: Digit Span age-corrected scaled score (ACSS) had the highest AUC (.648) of all measures assessed; however, sensitivity at the best cutoff of <7 was only 0.17. Of RDS measures, the Working Memory RDS resulted in the highest AUC (.629), but Enhanced RDS and Alternate RDS produced the highest sensitivities (0.22). Overall, cutoff scores were consistent with other studies, but sensitivities were lower. Vocabulary minus Digit Span measures were not significant.Conclusions: Digit Span ACSS was the strongest predictor of noncredible performance, and outperformed traditional RDS variants. Sensitivity across all validity indicators was low in this research sample, though cutoff scores were congruent with previous research. Although embedded Digit Span validity indicators may be useful, they are not sufficient to replace standalone performance validity tests.", "Hospital Eye Services (HES) in the UK face an increasing number of optometric referrals driven by progress in retinal imaging. The National Health Service (NHS) published a 10-year strategy (NHS Long-Term Plan) to transform services to meet this challenge. In this study, we implemented a cloud-based referral platform to improve communication between optometrists and ophthalmologists.\nRetrospective cohort study conducted at Moorfields Eye Hospital, Croydon (NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK). Patients classified into the HES referral pathway by contributing optometrists have been included into this study. Main outcome measures was the reduction of unnecessary referrals.\nAfter reviewing the patient's data in a web-based interface 54 (52%) out of 103 attending patients initially classified into the referral pathway did not need a specialist referral. Fourteen (14%) patients needing urgent treatment were identified. Usability was measured in duration for data input and reviewing which was an average of 9.2\u2009min (median: 5.4; IQR: 3.4-8.7) for optometrists and 3.0\u2009min (median: 3.0; IQR: 1.7-3.9)\u2009min for ophthalmologists. A variety of diagnosis was covered by this tool with dry age-related macular degeneration (n=34) being most common.\nAfter implementation more than half of the HES referrals have been avoided. This platform offers a digital-first solution that enables rapid-access eye care for patients in community optometrists, facilitates communication between healthcare providers and may serve as a foundation for implementation of artificial intelligence.", "Machine learning (ML) is the ability of computers to learn from data autonomously. It is a core branch of artificial intelligence (AI), which is defined as the ability of a machine to replicate the intellectual processes of humans independently.1,2 The evolution of the microprocessor for home computers resulted in increased computing speed, efficient data collection, storage, and retrieval capacity. Thus AI techniques have evolved, which led to the discovery of artificial neural networks which are computer modeling algorithms mimicking the human brain.3-6 AI has developed to an extent that it can exceed the human brain in board games such as chess, television games, image recognition, and spam e-mail filtering. In addition to engineering, arts, and finance, extensive progress has been made to integrate ML in the field of medicine, especially oncology.", "An effective way to achieve intelligence is to simulate various intelligent behaviors in the human brain. In recent years, bio-inspired learning methods have emerged, and they are different from the classical mathematical programming principle. From the perspective of brain inspiration, reinforcement learning has gained additional interest in solving decision-making tasks as increasing neuroscientific research demonstrates that significant links exist between reinforcement learning and specific neural substrates. Because of the tremendous research that focuses on human brains and reinforcement learning, scientists have investigated how robots can autonomously tackle complex tasks in the form of making a self-driving agent control in a human-like way. In this study, we propose an end-to-end architecture using novel deep-Q-network architecture in conjunction with a recurrence to resolve the problem in the field of simulated self-driving. The main contribution of this study is that we trained the driving agent using a brain-inspired trial-and-error technique, which was in line with the real world situation. Besides, there are three innovations in the proposed learning network: raw screen outputs are the only information which the driving agent can rely on, a weighted layer that enhances the differences of the lengthy episode, and a modified replay mechanism that overcomes the problem of sparsity and accelerates learning. The proposed network was trained and tested under a third-party OpenAI Gym environment. After training for several episodes, the resulting driving agent performed advanced behaviors in the given scene. We hope that in the future, the proposed brain-inspired learning system would inspire practicable self-driving control solutions.", "Breast imaging is a multimodal approach that plays an essential role in the diagnosis of breast cancer. Mammography, sonography, magnetic resonance, and image-guided biopsy are imaging techniques used to search for malignant changes in the breast or precursors of malignant changes in, e.g., screening programs or follow-ups after breast cancer treatment. However, these methods still have some disadvantages such as interobserver variability and the mammography sensitivity in women with radiologically dense breasts. In order to overcome these difficulties and decrease the number of false positive findings, improvements in imaging analysis with the help of artificial intelligence are constantly being developed and tested. In addition, the extraction and correlation of imaging features with special tumor characteristics and genetics of the patients in order to get more information about treatment response, prognosis, and also cancer risk are coming more and more in focus. The aim of this review is to address recent developments in digital analysis of images and demonstrate their potential value in multimodal breast imaging.", "In glioma surgery, it is critical to maximize tumor resection without compromising adjacent noncancerous brain tissue. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive, label-free, real-time, high-resolution imaging modality that has been explored for glioma infiltration detection. Here, we report a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted method for automated, real-time, in situ detection of glioma infiltration at high spatial resolution.Experimental Design: Volumetric OCT datasets were intraoperatively obtained from resected brain tissue specimens of 21 patients with glioma tumors of different stages and labeled as either noncancerous or glioma-infiltrated on the basis of histopathology evaluation of the tissue specimens (gold standard). Labeled OCT images from 12 patients were used as the training dataset to develop the AI-assisted OCT-based method for automated detection of glioma-infiltrated brain tissue. Unlabeled OCT images from the other 9 patients were used as the validation dataset to quantify the method detection performance.\nOur method achieved excellent levels of sensitivity (\u223c100%) and specificity (\u223c85%) for detecting glioma-infiltrated tissue with high spatial resolution (16 \u03bcm laterally) and processing speed (\u223c100,020 OCT A-lines/second).\nPrevious methods for OCT-based detection of glioma-infiltrated brain tissue rely on estimating the tissue optical attenuation coefficient from the OCT signal, which requires sacrificing spatial resolution to increase signal quality, and performing systematic calibration procedures using tissue phantoms. By overcoming these major challenges, our AI-assisted method will enable implementing practical OCT-guided surgical tools for continuous, real-time, and accurate intraoperative detection of glioma-infiltrated brain tissue, facilitating maximal glioma resection and superior surgical outcomes for patients with glioma.", "Advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) carry the potential to make significant contributions to health care, particularly in diagnostic specialties such as radiology and pathology. The impact of these technologies on physician stakeholders is the subject of significant speculation. There is however a dearth of information regarding the opinions, enthusiasm, and concerns of the pathology community at large. Here, we report results from a survey of 487 pathologist-respondents practicing in 54 countries, conducted to examine perspectives on AI implementation in clinical practice. Despite limitations, including difficulty with quantifying response bias and verifying identity of respondents to this anonymous and voluntary survey, several interesting findings were uncovered. Overall, respondents carried generally positive attitudes towards AI, with nearly 75% reporting interest or excitement in AI as a diagnostic tool to facilitate improvements in workflow efficiency and quality assurance in pathology. Importantly, even within the more optimistic cohort, a significant number of respondents endorsed concerns about AI, including the potential for job displacement and replacement. Overall, around 80% of respondents predicted the introduction of AI technology in the pathology laboratory within the coming decade. Attempts to identify statistically significant demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, type/place of practice) predictive of attitudes towards AI using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) testing revealed several associations. Important themes which were commented on by respondents included the need for increasing efforts towards physician training and resolving medical-legal implications prior to the generalized implementation of AI in pathology.", "Little is known about cognition and predictors of neuropsychological outcomes in pediatric low-grade glioma (PLGG) survivors treated without radiation therapy. This research expands upon our previous work by further identifying the cognitive profile of PLGG patients treated without radiation therapy, investigating the specific medical and demographic variables that predict functioning, and examining white matter structure and its relationship to neuropsychological performance.\nNineteen PLGG patients (11-19 years) were administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children/Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and subtests from the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognition (visual matching, rapid picture naming, and pair cancellation) and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (pattern recognition memory, delayed matching to sample, intra-extra dimensional set shift, motor screening task, rapid visual information processing, and spatial span).\nThe sample had normative weaknesses in verbal working memory, brief attention/vigilance, psychomotor speeded output, visual perception and matching, overall cognition, working memory, and processing speed. Increased surgeries or subtotal resections, hydrocephalus, shunting procedures, chemotherapy, NF1, and supratentorial location were predictive of cognitive deficits. Broad white matter involvement of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes as well as the cerebellum, as inferred from diffusion tensor imaging indices of decreased fiber orientation and increased water diffusion, was related to many cognitive difficulties.\nThis study comprehensively examines cognitive functioning in PLGG patients treated without radiation therapy, predictors of cognition, and its relation to white matter structure. Our findings indicate that medical and demographic variables other than radiation therapy can lead to cognitive late effects with diffuse white matter involvement.", "This study presents a modelling framework to predict the flowability of various commonly used pharmaceutical powders and their blends. The flowability models were trained and validated on 86 samples including single components and binary mixtures. Two modelling paradigms based on artificial intelligence (AI) namely, a radial basis function (RBF) and an integrated network were employed to model the flowability represented by the flow function coefficient (FFC) and the bulk density (RHOB). Both approaches were utilized to map the input parameters (i.e. particle size, shape descriptors and material type) to the flow properties. The input parameters of the blends were determined from the particle size, shape and material type properties of the single components. The results clearly indicated that the integrated network outperformed the single RBF network in terms of the predictive performance and the generalization capabilities. For the integrated network, the coefficient of determination of the testing data set (not used for training the model) for FFC was R2=0.93, reflecting an acceptable predictive power of this model. Since the flowability of the blends can be predicted from single component size and shape descriptors, the integrated network can assist formulators in selecting excipients and their blend concentrations to improve flowability with minimal experimental effort and material resulting in the (i) minimization of the time required, (ii) exploration and examination of the design space, and (iii) minimization of material waste.", "Strategic behavior plays a key role in fluid intelligence tasks like Raven's matrices. Some participants solve items using the strategy of mentally constructing the answer (constructive matching), which is effective but costly for complex problems; other participants rely on the less accurate strategy of discarding potential answers (response elimination). While this process is relatively well-known, past research hints that intraindividual changes in strategy use may also take place as the task becomes increasingly difficult; however, intraindividual variability in Raven's matrices is poorly understood. The present study aimed to (a) test the hypothesis that participants dynamically shift between strategies during the course of Raven's matrices, as predicted by the literature, and (b) investigate the possibility that these shifts are moderated by individual differences in both ability and motivation. Two samples of 100 participants each completed Raven's advanced progressive matrices, and measures of working memory and need for cognition. The results confirmed that participants tended to turn to the less costly response elimination strategy as the difficulty of the task increased; this variability in strategy use predicted 78% of item-to-item variance in accuracy. Working memory capacity and need for cognition predicted strategy use, and working memory capacity additionally moderated the shift toward response elimination, so that only participants with both high working memory capacity and high need for cognition continued using constructive matching in the later part of the task.

Pediatric patients therefore have considerable risks of neurocognitive impairment after brain radiotherapy. In this study, we investigated the radiation doses received by BSCs for three common locations of pediatric brain tumor entities. Material and methods: For ten patients in each group [posterior fossa ependymoma (PFE), craniopharyngioma (CP), and hemispheric ependymoma (HE)], the cumulative fraction of BSCs volumes receiving various dose levels were analyzed. We subsequently explored the differences in dose pattern between the three groups and used available dose response models from the literature to estimate treatment-induced intelligence quotient (IQ) decline. Results: Doses to BSCs were found to differ considerably between the groups, depending on their position relative to the tumor. Large inter-patient variations were observed in the ipsilateral structures of the HE groups, and at low doses for all three groups. IQ decline estimates differed depending on the model applied, presenting larger variations in the HE group. Conclusion: While there were notable differences in the dose patterns between the groups, the extent of estimated IQ decline depended more on the model applied. This inter-model variability should be considered in dose-effect assessments on cognitive outcomes of pediatric patients.", "The purpose of this study was to initiate and stimulate collaborative research efforts to support United European Gastroenterology Federation (UEG) member societies facilitating digestive health research in European on the one hand and, on the other hand, to increase EU-funded digestive health research by providing evidence and advice to funding bodies on priority areas. The UEG Research Committee initiated a survey of the current and future research interests of each individual UEG ordinary member society (specialist societies).\nA questionnaire was sent by mail to 17 UEG ordinary member societies asking them to specify research demands related to the most urgent medical need including basic science research, translational research, clinical research, patient management research and research on disease prevention, in an open fashion but with limited word count.\nThe responses from 13 societies were analysed in a semi-quantitative and in a qualitative way, and were clustered into five domains with two aspects each that were consented and shared between three and seven of the responding 13 societies. These clusters resemble topics such as 'Hot topics' (e.g. life-style, nutrition, microbial-host interaction), Biomarkers (genetic profiling, gut-brain interaction), Advanced technology (artificial intelligence, personalised medicine), Global research tools (bio-banking, EU trials), and Medical training (education, prevention).\nThe generated topic list allows both collaboration between individual specialist societies as well as initiating and fostering future research calls at the EU level and beyond when approaching stakeholders.", "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of patient care, but there are concerns about the impact of non\u2010human decision assistance on patient outcomes. This commentary focuses on how AI can assist oncologists and benefit patients.", "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genomic imprinting disorder characterized by infantile hypotonia with a poor suck and failure to thrive, hypogenitalism/hypogonadism, behavior and cognitive problems, hormone deficiencies, hyperphagia, and obesity. The Stanford Binet and Wechsler (WAIS-R; WISC-III) intelligence (IQ) tests were administered on 103 individuals with PWS from two separate cohorts [University of California, Irvine (UCI) (N = 56) and Vanderbilt University (N = 47)] and clinical information obtained including growth hormone (GH) treatment, PWS molecular classes, weight and height. Significantly higher IQ scores (p\u2009<\u2009.02) were found representing the vocabulary section of the Stanford Binet test in the growth hormone (GH) treated group when compared with non-GH treatment in the pediatric-based UCI PWS cohort with a trend for stabilization of vocabulary IQ scores with age in the GH treated maternal disomy (UPD) 15 subject group. Significant differences (p = .05) were also found in the adult-based Vanderbilt PWS cohort with 15q11-q13 deletion subjects having lower Verbal IQ scores compared with UPD 15. No difference in body mass index was identified based on the PWS molecular class or genetic subtype. Medical care and response to treatment with growth hormone may influence intelligence impacted by PWS genetic subtypes and possibly age, but more studies are needed.", "Metallic materials with engineered optical properties have the potential to enhance the performance of energy harvesting and storage devices operating at the macro- and nanoscale, such as solar cells, photocatalysts, water splitting, and hydrogen storage systems. For both thin films and subwavelength nanostructures, upon illumination, the coherent oscillation of charge carriers at the interface with a dielectric material gives rise to resonances named surface plasmon polariton (SPP) and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), respectively. These resonances result in unique light absorption, scattering, and transmission responses over the electromagnetic spectrum, which, in turn, can be exploited to tailor the behavior of active metallic components in optoelectronic devices containing Ag, Au, Cu, Al, Mg, among other metals. The wavelength in which the resonances occur primarily depends on the metal itself (i.e., the dielectric function or permittivity), the dielectric medium surrounding the metals, and the size, geometry, and periodicity of the metallic nanostructures. Nevertheless, the aforementioned parameters allow a limited modulation of both SPP and LSPR over a narrow window of frequencies. To overcome this constraint, we have proposed and realized the alloying of metals via physical deposition methods as a paradigm to almost arbitrarily tuning their optical behavior in the UV-NIR, which leads to permittivity values currently not available. Our approach offers an additional knob, chemical composition, to engineer light-matter interactions in metallic materials. This Account highlights recent progress in using alloying as a pathway to control the optical behavior of metallic thin films and nanostructures for energy harvesting and storage applications, including (photo)catalysis, photovoltaics, superabsorbers, hydrogen storage, among other systems. We choose to primarily focus on the optical properties of the metallic mixtures and in their near- to far-field responses in the UV-NIR range of the spectrum as they represent key parameters for materials' selection for the devices above. By alloying, it is possible to obtain metallic materials with LSPR not available for pure metals, which can enable the further control of the electromagnetic spectrum. First, we discuss how the permittivity of binary mixtures of coinage metals (Au, Ag, and Cu) can be tailored based on the chemical composition of their pure counterparts. Second, we present how novel metallic materials can be designed through band structure engineering through density functional theory (DFT), a paradigm that could benefit from artificial intelligence methods. Concerning alloyed thin films, we discuss the promise of earth-abundant metals and provide an example of the superior performance of AlCu in superabsorbers. In the realm of nanostructures, we focus the discussion on physical deposition methods, where we provide a detailed analysis of how chemical composition can affect the far- and near-field responses of metallic building blocks. Finally, we provide a brief outlook of promising next steps in the field.", "The digital revolution is disrupting the ways in which health research is conducted, and subsequently, changing healthcare. Direct-to-consumer wellness products and mobile apps, pervasive sensor technologies and access to social network data offer exciting opportunities for researchers to passively observe and/or track patients 'in the wild' and 24/7. The volume of granular personal health data gathered using these technologies is unprecedented, and is increasingly leveraged to inform personalized health promotion and disease treatment interventions. The use of artificial intelligence in the health sector is also increasing. Although rich with potential, the digital health ecosystem presents new ethical challenges for those making decisions about the selection, testing, implementation and evaluation of technologies for use in healthcare. As the 'Wild West' of digital health research unfolds, it is important to recognize who is involved, and identify how each party can and should take responsibility to advance the ethical practices of this work. While not a comprehensive review, we describe the landscape, identify gaps to be addressed, and offer recommendations as to how stakeholders can and should take responsibility to advance socially responsible digital health research.", "Background: The effect of depression on decision-making is an important but still an unsettled issue. Although most studies have reported that clinically depressed participants show worse performance, there are also studies that have shown no or even positive effects. Specifically, von Helversen et al. (2011) were able to document a positive effect of depression on task performance in a sequential decision-making task called the secretary problem (SP). Here, we (1) aimed to replicate this study in an extended version using more trials and (2) modified it by including an additional condition in which negative feedback was given. Method: Eighty-two participants took part. They were split into two groups: 20/21 participants with major depression disorder (MDD) and 20/21 matched healthy participants. Participants completed the secretary problem either in the standard or in a modified version. Additionally, they answered questionnaires for assessing depression, personality, and intelligence. Results: We did not find any significant differences between clinically depressed and nondepressed individuals in any indicators of task performance, under both the original and modified conditions. Limitations: Our participants were ambulatory patients. The quality of depression may have been therefore less extreme. We did not assess or control for rumination. Conclusions: We were not able to detect any significant differences between the performances of healthy and clinically depressed participants in a sequential decision-making task.", "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly in the field of medical imaging. However, the collaborations among hospitals, research institutes and enterprises are insufficient at the present, and there are various issues in technological transformation and value landing of products in this area. To solve the core problems in the developmental path of medical imaging AI, the Chinese Innovative Alliance of Industry, Education, Research and Application of Artificial Intelligence for Medical Imaging compiled the White Paper on Medical Image AI in China. This article introduces the current status of collaboration, the clinical demands for medical imaging AI technique, and the key points in AI technology transformation: robustness, usability and security. We are facing challenges of lacking industry standards, data desensitization standard, assessment system, as well as corresponding regulations and policies to realize the application values of AI products in medical imaging. Further development of AI in medical imaging requires breakthroughs of the core algorithm, deep involvement of doctors, input from capitals, patience from societies, and most importantly, the resolutions from government for multiple difficulties in links of landing the technology.", "Prediction of kidney function and chronic kidney disease (CKD) through kidney ultrasound imaging has long been considered desirable in clinical practice because of its safety, convenience, and affordability. However, this highly desirable approach is beyond the capability of human vision. We developed a deep learning approach for automatically determining the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and CKD status. We exploited the transfer learning technique, integrating the powerful ResNet model pretrained on an ImageNet dataset in our neural network architecture, to predict kidney function based on 4,505 kidney ultrasound images labeled using eGFRs derived from serum creatinine concentrations. To further extract the information from ultrasound images, we leveraged kidney length annotations to remove the peripheral region of the kidneys and applied various data augmentation schemes to produce additional data with variations. Bootstrap aggregation was also applied to avoid overfitting and improve the model's generalization. Moreover, the kidney function features obtained by our deep neural network were used to identify the CKD status defined by an eGFR of <60\u2009ml/min/1.73\u2009m2. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.741 indicated the strong relationship between artificial intelligence (AI)- and creatinine-based GFR estimations. Overall CKD status classification accuracy of our model was 85.6% -higher than that of experienced nephrologists (60.3%-80.1%). Our model is the first fundamental step toward realizing the potential of transforming kidney ultrasound imaging into an effective, real-time, distant screening tool. AI-GFR estimation offers the possibility of noninvasive assessment of kidney function, a key goal of AI-powered functional automation in clinical practice.", "The construction of high capacity data sharing networks to support increasing government and commercial data exchange has highlighted a key roadblock: the content of existing Internet-connected information remains siloed due to a multiplicity of local languages and data dictionaries. This lack of a digital lingua franca is obvious in the domain of human food as materials travel from their wild or farm origin, through processing and distribution chains, to consumers. Well defined, hierarchical vocabulary, connected with logical relationships-in other words, an ontology-is urgently needed to help tackle data harmonization problems that span the domains of food security, safety, quality, production, distribution, and consumer health and convenience. FoodOn (http://foodon.org) is a consortium-driven project to build a comprehensive and easily accessible global farm-to-fork ontology about food, that accurately and consistently describes foods commonly known in cultures from around the world. FoodOn addresses food product terminology gaps and supports food traceability. Focusing on human and domesticated animal food description, FoodOn contains animal and plant food sources, food categories and products, and other facets like preservation processes, contact surfaces, and packaging. Much of FoodOn's vocabulary comes from transforming LanguaL, a mature and popular food indexing thesaurus, into a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) OWL Web Ontology Language-formatted vocabulary that provides system interoperability, quality control, and software-driven intelligence. FoodOn compliments other technologies facilitating food traceability, which is becoming critical in this age of increasing globalization of food networks.", "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue worldwide. However, the status of kidney health care needs to be strengthened globally and research evidence in nephrology is relatively limited. The unmet needs in nephrology leave ample space for imagination regarding leveraging big data and artificial intelligence (AI). Big data has potential to drive medical innovation, reduce medical costs and improve health care quality. Compared with other specialties such as cardiology, the scopes of utilizing big data in nephrology need to be enhanced. We reviewed the studies on the application of big data in nephrology, such as disease surveillance, risk prediction and clinical decision support systems (CDSS), and proposed several potential directions of utilizing big data and AI. The efforts including building a CKD surveillance system and collaborative network, implementing a real-world cohort in a cost-effective manner, strengthening the application and transformation of AI and CDSS, and stimulating the activeness of medical imaging in nephrology, could be considered. In the era of big data, a nephrologist would be stronger and smarter if he or she could get intelligent assistance from knowledge or big data-driven CDSS.", "In spite of the abundance of genomic data, predictive models that describe phenotypes as a function of gene expression or mutations are difficult to obtain because they are affected by the curse of dimensionality, given the disbalance between samples and candidate genes. And this is especially dramatic in scenarios in which the availability of samples is difficult, such as the case of rare diseases.\nThe application of multi-output regression machine learning methodologies to predict the potential effect of external proteins over the signaling circuits that trigger Fanconi anemia related cell functionalities, inferred with a mechanistic model, allowed us to detect over 20 potential therapeutic targets.\nThe use of artificial intelligence methods for the prediction of potentially causal relationships between proteins of interest and cell activities related with disease-related phenotypes opens promising avenues for the systematic search of new targets in rare diseases.", "This article reviews the principles of unsupervised learning, a novel technique which has increasingly been reported as a tool for the investigation of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). It represents a paradigm shift from the traditional approach to investigating CRS based upon the clinically recognized phenotypes of \"with polyps\" and \"without polyps\" and instead relies upon the application of complex mathematical models to derive subgroups which can then be further examined. This review article reports on the principles which underlie this investigative technique and some of the published examples in CRS.\nThis review summarizes the different types of unsupervised learning techniques which have been described and briefly expounds upon their useful applications. A literature review of studies which have unsupervised learning is then presented to provide a practical guide to its uses and some of the new directions of investigations suggested by their findings.\nThe commonest unsupervised learning technique applied to rhinology research is cluster analysis, which can be further subdivided into hierarchical and non-hierarchical approaches. The mathematical principles which underpin these approaches are explained within this article. Studies which have used these techniques can be broadly divided into those which have used clinical data only and that which includes biomarkers. Studies which include biomarkers adhere closely to the established canon of CRS disease phenotypes, while those that use clinical data may diverge from the typical \"polyp versus non-polyp\" phenotypes and reflect subgroups of patients who share common symptom modifiers.\nArtificial intelligence is increasingly influential in health care research and machine learning techniques have been reported in the investigation of CRS, promising several interesting new avenues for research. However, when critically appraising studies which use this technique, the reader needs to be au fait with the limitations and appropriate uses of its application.", "This study evaluated whether the consumption of locally produced food without additives might have a positive effect on known risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension, and levels of fasting glucose and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Attention was focused on various types of cheese, sausages, fresh pasta, pastries, biscuits and chocolate without additives to make them palatable and durable for transport.\nHealthy volunteers were randomized to purchase the foods under study from either local producers not using additives (group 1) or supermarkets (group 2). At baseline and after 6 months, both groups underwent evaluation for weight, blood pressure, VAT, serum sodium, potassium, fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide and creatinine levels, and also the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) by examiners blinded to group allocation. At baseline, the state part of the STAI and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV were also performed, and body mass index, HOMA index and estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated.\nData for 159 subjects (89 in group 1, 70 in group 2) were analyzed. Baseline evaluations did not differ between groups. At 6 months, HOMA scores and fasting glucose levels were lower in group 1 than in group 2 (P<0.01). Also, in group 1, VAT (P=0.006), systolic blood pressure (P=0.001) and BDI-II score (P=0.0005) were decreased, whereas serum fasting glucose (P=0.04) and C-peptide (P=0.03) levels, and diastolic blood pressure (P=0.02), were increased in group 2.\nConsumption of the locally produced food under study improved some of the major risk factors for NCDs after 6 months.", "Cognitive abilities, such as working memory, selective attention, inhibition, alertness, and flexibility, are collectively known as executive functioning (EF), which is essential in daily life routines. For instance, EF is important when planning a series of actions, in novel situations, or during the performance of complex tasks. General intelligence, or g, is a related construct and involves, for instance, the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, and learn from experience. The concept g is usually measured with a psychometric intelligence test. It has been known for more than a decade that EF and, in particular, g are negatively correlated with psychopathology. Yet, the underlying source of this correlation is largely unknown.", "Big data, coupled with the use of advanced analytical approaches, such as artificial intelligence (AI), have the potential to improve medical outcomes and population health. Data that are routinely generated from, for example, electronic medical records and smart devices have become progressively easier and cheaper to collect, process, and analyze. In recent decades, this has prompted a substantial increase in biomedical research efforts outside traditional clinical trial settings. Despite the apparent enthusiasm of researchers, funders, and the media, evidence is scarce for successful implementation of products, algorithms, and services arising that make a real difference to clinical care. This article collection provides concrete examples of how \"big data\" can be used to advance healthcare and discusses some of the limitations and challenges encountered with this type of research. It primarily focuses on real-world data, such as electronic medical records and genomic medicine, considers new developments in AI and digital health, and discusses ethical considerations and issues related to data sharing. Overall, we remain positive that big data studies and associated new technologies will continue to guide novel, exciting research that will ultimately improve healthcare and medicine-but we are also realistic that concerns remain about privacy, equity, security, and benefit to all.", "Approaches are needed to better delineate the continuum of opioid misuse that occurs in hospitalized patients. A prognostic enrichment strategy with latent class analysis (LCA) may facilitate treatment strategies in subtypes of opioid misuse. We aim to identify subtypes of patients with opioid misuse and examine the distinctions between the subtypes by examining patient characteristics, topic models from clinical notes, and clinical outcomes.\nThis was an observational study of inpatient hospitalizations at a tertiary care center between 2007 and 2017. Patients with opioid misuse were identified using an operational definition applied to all inpatient encounters. LCA with eight class-defining variables from the electronic health record (EHR) was applied to identify subtypes in the cohort of patients with opioid misuse. Comparisons between subtypes were made using the following approaches: (1) descriptive statistics on patient characteristics and healthcare utilization using EHR data and census-level data; (2) topic models with natural language processing (NLP) from clinical notes; (3) association with hospital outcomes.\nThe analysis cohort was 6,224 (2.7% of all hospitalizations) patient encounters with opioid misuse with a data corpus of 422,147 clinical notes. LCA identified four subtypes with differing patient characteristics, topics from the clinical notes, and hospital outcomes. Class 1 was categorized by high hospital utilization with known opioid-related conditions (36.5%); Class 2 included patients with illicit use, low socioeconomic status, and psychoses (12.8%); Class 3 contained patients with alcohol use disorders with complications (39.2%); and class 4 consisted of those with low hospital utilization and incidental opioid misuse (11.5%). The following hospital outcomes were the highest for each subtype when compared against the other subtypes: readmission for class 1 (13.9% vs. 10.5%, p<0.01); discharge against medical advice for class 2 (12.3% vs. 5.3%, p<0.01); and in-hospital death for classes 3 and 4 (3.2% vs. 1.9%, p<0.01).\nA 4-class latent model was the most parsimonious model that defined clinically interpretable and relevant subtypes for opioid misuse. Distinct subtypes were delineated after examining multiple domains of EHR data and applying methods in artificial intelligence. The approach with LCA and readily available class-defining substance use variables from the EHR may be applied as a prognostic enrichment strategy for targeted interventions.", "The degree of Allele sharing of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes has been linked with recurrent miscarriage (RM). However, no clear genetic markers of RM have yet been identified, possibly because of the complexity of interactions between paternal and maternal genes during embryo development. We propose a methodology to analyse HLA haplotypes from couples either with histories of successful pregnancies or RM. This article describes a method of RM genetic-risk calculation. The proposed HLA representation techniques allowed us to create an algorithm (IMMATCH) to retrospectively predict RM with an AUC\u2009=\u20090.71 (p\u2009=\u20090.0035) thanks to high-resolution typing and the use of linear algebra on peptide binding affinity data. The algorithm features an adjustable threshold to increase either sensitivity or specificity, allowing a sensitivity of 86%. Combining immunogenetics with artificial intelligence could create personalised tools to better understand the genetic causes of unexplained infertility and a gamete matching platform that could increase pregnancy success rates.", "The Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution foretold of during the 1960s is well underway in the second decade of the twenty first century. Its period of phenomenal growth likely lies ahead. AI-operated machines and technologies will extend the reach of Homo sapiens far beyond the biological constraints imposed by evolution: outwards further into deep space, as well as inwards into the nano-world of DNA sequences and relevant medical applications. And yet, we believe, there are crucial lessons that biology can offer that will enable a prosperous future for AI. For machines in general, and for AI's especially, operating over extended periods or in extreme environments will require energy usage orders of magnitudes more efficient than exists today. In many operational environments, energy sources will be constrained. The AI's design and function may be dependent upon the type of energy source, as well as its availability and accessibility. Any plans for AI devices operating in a challenging environment must begin with the question of how they are powered, where fuel is located, how energy is stored and made available to the machine, and how long the machine can operate on specific energy units. While one of the key advantages of AI use is to reduce the dimensionality of a complex problem, the fact remains that some energy is required for functionality. Hence, the materials and technologies that provide the needed energy represent a critical challenge toward future use scenarios of AI and should be integrated into their design. Here we look to the brain and other aspects of biology as inspiration for Biomimetic Research for Energy-efficient AI Designs (BREAD).", "We report a conjugated polyelectrolyte fluorescence-based biosensor P-C-3 and a general methodology to evaluate spectral shape recognition to identify biomolecules using artificial intelligence. By using well-defined analytes, we demonstrate that the fluorescence spectral shape of P-C-3 is sensitive to minor structural changes and exhibits distinct signature patterns for different analytes. A method was also developed to select useful features to reduce computational complexity and prevent overfitting of the data. It was found that the normalized intensity of 3 to 5 selected wavelengths was sufficient for the fluorescence biosensor to classify 13 distinct nucleotides and distinguish as little as single base substitutions at distinct positions in the primary sequence of oligonucleotides rapidly with nearly 100% classification accuracy. Photophysical studies led to a model to explain the mechanism of these fluorescence spectral shape changes, which provides theoretical support for applying this method in complicated biological systems. Using the feature selection algorithm to measure the relative intensity of a few selected wavelengths significantly reduces measurement time, demonstrating the potential for fluorescence spectrum shape analysis in high-throughput and high-content screening.", "Despite the impressive results of recent artificial intelligence applications to general ophthalmology, comparatively less progress has been made toward solving problems in pediatric ophthalmology using similar techniques. This article discusses the unique needs of pediatric patients and how artificial intelligence techniques can address these challenges, surveys recent applications to pediatric ophthalmology, and discusses future directions.\nThe most significant advances involve the automated detection of retinopathy of prematurity, yielding results that rival experts. Machine learning has also been applied to the classification of pediatric cataracts, prediction of postoperative complications following cataract surgery, detection of strabismus and refractive error, prediction of future high myopia, and diagnosis of reading disability. In addition, machine learning techniques have been used for the study of visual development, vessel segmentation in pediatric fundus images, and ophthalmic image synthesis.\nArtificial intelligence applications could significantly benefit clinical care by optimizing disease detection and grading, broadening access to care, furthering scientific discovery, and improving clinical efficiency. These methods need to match or surpass physician performance in clinical trials before deployment with patients. Owing to the widespread use of closed-access data sets and software implementations, it is difficult to directly compare the performance of these approaches, and reproducibility is poor. Open-access data sets and software could alleviate these issues and encourage further applications to pediatric ophthalmology.", "Artificial intelligence and deep learning methods hold great promise in the medical sciences in areas such as enhanced tumor identification from radiographic images, and natural language processing to extract complex information from electronic health records. Scientific review of AI algorithms has involved reproducibility, in which investigators share protocols, raw data, and programming codes. Within the realm of medicine, reproducibility introduces important challenges, including risk to patient privacy, challenges in reproducing results, and questions regarding ownership and financial value of large medical datasets. Scientific review, however, mandates some form of resolution of these inherent conflicts. We propose several approaches to permit scientific review while maintaining patient privacy and data confidentiality.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) driven by machine learning (ML) algorithms is a branch in computer science that is rapidly gaining popularity within the healthcare sector. Recent regulatory approvals of AI-driven companion diagnostics and other products are glimmers of a future in which these tools could play a key role by defining the way medicine will be practiced. Educating the next generation of medical professionals with the right ML techniques will enable them to become part of this emerging data science revolution.", "Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care have garnered much attention in recent years, but the implementation issues posed by AI have not been substantially addressed.\nIn this paper, we have focused on machine learning (ML) as a form of AI and have provided a framework for thinking about use cases of ML in health care. We have structured our discussion of challenges in the implementation of ML in comparison with other technologies using the framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS).\nAfter providing an overview of AI technology, we describe use cases of ML as falling into the categories of decision support and automation. We suggest these use cases apply to clinical, operational, and epidemiological tasks and that the primary function of ML in health care in the near term will be decision support. We then outline unique implementation issues posed by ML initiatives in the categories addressed by the NASSS framework, specifically including meaningful decision support, explainability, privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, security, scalability, the role of corporations, and the changing nature of health care work.\nUltimately, we suggest that the future of ML in health care remains positive but uncertain, as support from patients, the public, and a wide range of health care stakeholders is necessary to enable its meaningful implementation.\nIf the implementation science community is to facilitate the adoption of ML in ways that stand to generate widespread benefits, the issues raised in this paper will require substantial attention in the coming years.", "Polygenic scores are a popular tool for prediction of complex traits. However, prediction estimates in samples of unrelated participants can include effects of population stratification, assortative mating, and environmentally mediated parental genetic effects, a form of genotype-environment correlation (rGE). Comparing genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) predictions in unrelated individuals with predictions between siblings in a within-family design is a powerful approach to identify these different sources of prediction. Here, we compared within- to between-family GPS predictions of eight outcomes (anthropometric, cognitive, personality, and health) for eight corresponding GPSs. The outcomes were assessed in up to 2,366 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study from age 12 to age 21. To account for family clustering, we used mixed-effects modeling, simultaneously estimating within- and between-family effects for target- and cross-trait GPS prediction of the outcomes. There were three main findings: (1) DZ twin GPS differences predicted DZ differences in height, BMI, intelligence, educational achievement, and ADHD symptoms; (2) target and cross-trait analyses indicated that GPS prediction estimates for cognitive traits (intelligence and educational achievement) were on average 60% greater between families than within families, but this was not the case for non-cognitive traits; and (3) much of this within- and between-family difference for cognitive traits disappeared after controlling for family socio-economic status (SES), suggesting that SES is a major source of between-family prediction through rGE mechanisms. These results provide insights into the patterns by which rGE contributes to GPS prediction, while ruling out confounding due to population stratification and assortative mating.", "The Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B) is commonly used as a brief and simple neuropsychological assessment of executive dysfunction. The TMT-B is thought to rely on a number of distinct cognitive processes that predict individual differences in performance. The current study examined the unique and shared contributions of latent component variables in a large cohort of older people. Five hundred and eighty-seven healthy, community-dwelling older adults who were all born in 1936 were assessed on the TMT-B and multiple tasks tapping cognitive domains of visuospatial ability, processing speed, memory and reading ability. Firstly, a first-order measurement model examining independent contributions of the four cognitive domains was fitted; a significant relationship between TMT-B completion times and processing speed was found (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.610, p\u202f<\u202f.001). Secondly, a bifactor model examined the unique influence of each cognitive ability when controlling for a general cognitive factor. Importantly, both a general cognitive factor (g; \u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.561, p\u202f<\u202f.001) and additional g-independent variance from processing speed (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f-0.464, p\u202f<\u202f.001) contributed to successful TMT-B performance. These findings suggest that older adults' TMT-B performance is influenced by both general intelligence and processing speed, which may help understand poor performance on such tasks in clinical populations.", "Historically, the term \"artificial intelligence\" dates to 1956 when it was first used in a conference at Dartmouth College in the US. Since then, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain, scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, future research into artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context, there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI). Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on scientific cultures, work force, and society at large.", "Post-operative pediatric cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS), characterized by mutism, ataxia/hypotonia, and emotional lability, can result in long-term deficits following resection of posterior fossa (PF) tumors. This longitudinal study compared neuropsychological outcomes of pediatric patients with post-operative CMS to a matched control patient group without CMS.\nFifty-eight PF tumor patients received post-surgical proton radiation therapy (PRT) and testing at baseline and at \u2265\u20091-year post-PRT over a 10-year period. Of these, 18 (31%) had post-operative CMS with baseline and follow-up neuropsychological test data. Those participants were matched to 18 controls by tumor location, age, gender, and handedness; no significant group differences were found at baseline for clinical/demographic variables. Total mean age at baseline was 7.26\u00a0years (SD\u2009=\u20094.42); mean follow-up interval was 3.26\u00a0years (SD\u2009=\u20092.24). Areas assessed: overall intelligence, expressive and receptive vocabulary, visuomotor integration, fine motor speed, inhibition, emotional control, depression, and anxiety.\nPatients were 52% male; 86% medulloblastoma/14% ependymoma; 86% craniospinal irradiation/14% focal radiation; and 86% chemotherapy. No group differences were found between most mean baseline scores; expressive vocabulary and fine motor speed were significantly lower in the post-operative CMS group (p\u00a0<\u20090.05). Mean change scores revealed no significant differences for the sample; scores were within the normal range except fine motor skills were impaired for both groups.\nLongitudinal neuropsychological outcomes for post-operative pediatric CMS patients did not differ significantly from matched controls without this condition. Patients were in the normal range in all areas except fine motor speed, which was impaired for both groups independent of CMS diagnosis.", "As more biosimilars become available in the United States, postapproval noninterventional studies describing biosimilar switching and comparing effectiveness and/or safety between switchers and nonswitchers will play a key role in generating real-world evidence to inform clinical practices and policy decisions. Ensuring sound methodology is critical for making valid inferences from these studies.\nThe Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) convened a workgroup consisting of academic researchers, industry scientists, and practicing clinicians to establish best practice recommendations for the conduct of noninterventional studies of biosimilar and reference biologic switching. The workgroup members participated in eight teleconferences between August 2017 and February 2018 to discuss specific topics and build consensus.\nThis report provides workgroup recommendations covering five main considerations relating to noninterventional studies describing reference biologic to biosimilar switching and comparing reference biologic to biosimilars for safety and effectiveness in the presence of switching at treatment initiation and during follow-up: (a) selecting appropriate data sources from a range of available options including insurance claims, electronic health records, and registries; (b) study designs; (c) outcomes of interest including health care utilization and clinical endpoints; (d) analytic approaches including propensity scores, disease risk scores, and instrumental variables; and (e) special considerations including avoiding designs that ignore history of biologic use, avoiding immortal time bias, exposure misclassification, and accounting for postindex switching.\nRecommendations provided in this report provide a framework that may be helpful in designing and critically evaluating postapproval noninterventional studies involving reference biologic to biosimilar switching.", "The study investigated the association between emotional intelligence and academic success among undergraduates of Kohat University of Science & Technology (KUST), Pakistan. A sample of 186 students who were enrolled during the semester Fall 2015 to Spring 2018 was selected through a random sampling technique. A cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational research methods were employed in this study. A standardized tool \"Emotional Intelligence Scale\" was employed for the collection of information from the undergraduates. Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of the students was considered as academic success. Data were collected through personal visits. Statistical tools i.e., simple percentage, mean, standard deviation, ANOVA, Pearson's product-moment correlation and multiple linear regression were employed to reach the desired research outcomes. The findings revealed that there was a strong positive relationship (r = 0.880) between emotional intelligence and academic success among undergraduate students. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that self-development (Beta = 0.296), emotional stability (Beta = 0.197), managing relations (Beta = 0.170), altruistic behaviour (Beta = 0.145), and commitment (Beta = 0.117) predict academic success of undergraduates positively. The findings suggest that the emotional intelligence of the undergraduate students may be further improved so that their academic performance may further be enhanced.", "The genetic control strategies of vector borne diseases includes the replacement of a vector population by \"disease-refractory\" mosquitoes and the release of mosquitoes with a gene to control the vector's reproduction rates. Wolbachia are common intracellular bacteria that are found in arthropods and nematodes. Wolbachia infected male mosquitos have been used in different experimental trials around the world to suppress the target population of Aedes aegypti and this genetic control strategy has proved to be a promising alternative to other treatment strategies. Due to certain limitations, the successful application of this strategy is still awaited.\nMathematical frame work for Wolbachia induced genetic control strategy has been developed in this article. With the aid of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, accurate parametric values are depicted. For the first time, the model is well synchronized with the experimental findings. The model is comprised of the generalized varying coefficient and multiple mating rates between infected and uninfected compartments of Aedes aegypti dengue to forecast the disease control.\nTwo mathematical models are developed in this article to demonstrate different mating rates of the genetic control strategy. The important parameters and time varying coefficients are well demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be a useful tool for future experimental studies.\nFrom our analysis, we have concluded that the genetic control strategy is a promising technique and the role of Wolbachia infected male mosquitos, in genetic control strategies, can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical model.", "For patients with dementia and their family, artificial intelligence (AI) has been utilized to support diagnosis and evaluation. In addition, communication robots equipped with AI offer a way to maintain the cognitive functions of patients with dementia. Moreover, AI is currently used for fall prevention and to define the needs of patients and their family and to convey them to develop new devices. The expectation for AI is to make the quality of life for patients and their family's better than ever.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) will reshape radiology over the coming years. The radiology community has a strong history of embracing new technology for positive change, and AI is no exception. As with any new technology, rapid, successful implementation faces several challenges that will require creation and adoption of new integration technology. Use cases important to real-world application of AI are described, including clinical registries, AI research, AI product validation, and computer assistance for radiology reporting. Furthermore, the informatics technologies required for successful implementation of the use cases are described, including open Computer-Assisted Radiologist Decision Support, ACR Assist, ACR Data Science Institute use cases, common data elements (radelement.org), RadLex (radlex.org), LOINC/RSNA RadLex Playbook (loinc.org), and Radiology Report Templates (radreport.org).", "Disruption of the normal patterns of structural brain asymmetry, and in language-related areas, has been reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We tested the hypothesis that 16 children born extremely preterm (EPT), and diagnosed with ASD at 6.5 years of age (EPT-ASD), would have different patterns of brain structural asymmetry, particularly in language-related areas, to 21 EPT children without ASD and 15 term-born children. They all underwent neonatal magnetic resonance imaging scans at 40\u2009weeks of gestation. ASD diagnoses and the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, were performed in the EPT children, but not in the term group. Asymmetry indices (AIs) were assessed at three levels: global (hemispheres), lobar (brain lobes), and modular (primary sensorimotor, unimodal, and higher-order association areas). AIs were also assessed in language-related regions and correlational analyses were performed between these AIs and verbal scores. The EPT-ASD group showed reduced structural asymmetry at the modular level, mainly involving the higher-order association cortices and the language-related areas. Predominant positive correlations between language functioning and leftward AIs in the inferior frontal gyrus (opercular) and supplementary cortices, and rightward asymmetry in the angular and supramarginal gyri, were identified in the EPT-ASD group. The overall results suggest that reduced brain structural asymmetry identified during the neonatal period would be a risk factor for the development of ASD in EPT infants. This finding could identify EPT children at risk at an early stage, so that tailored interventions could be used to optimize their functions and quality of life. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1334-1343. \u00a9 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Babies born before the expected date (preterm) are more likely to develop autism, due to abnormal brain development. Compared with children without autism, preterm children with autism did not display the important physical differences between the two sides of their brain that are needed for normal functioning. As this alteration was found just after birth, this information could be used to identify children who are likely to develop autism, so that they can get medical support at an earlier age.", "The quantitative imaging features (radiomics) that can be obtained from the different modalities of current-generation hybrid imaging can give complementary information with regard to the tumour environment, as they measure different morphologic and functional imaging properties. These multi-parametric image descriptors can be combined with artificial intelligence applications into predictive models. It is now the time for hybrid PET/CT and PET/MRI to take the advantage offered by radiomics to assess the added clinical benefit of using multi-parametric models for the personalized diagnosis and prognosis of different disease phenotypes.\nThe aim of the paper is to provide an overview of current challenges and available solutions to translate radiomics into hybrid PET-CT and PET-MRI imaging for a smart and truly multi-parametric decision model.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology are two fields that are instrumental in realizing the goal of precision medicine-tailoring the best treatment for each cancer patient. Recent conversion between these two fields is enabling better patient data acquisition and improved design of nanomaterials for precision cancer medicine. Diagnostic nanomaterials are used to assemble a patient-specific disease profile, which is then leveraged, through a set of therapeutic nanotechnologies, to improve the treatment outcome. However, high intratumor and interpatient heterogeneities make the rational design of diagnostic and therapeutic platforms, and analysis of their output, extremely difficult. Integration of AI approaches can bridge this gap, using pattern analysis and classification algorithms for improved diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy. Nanomedicine design also benefits from the application of AI, by optimizing material properties according to predicted interactions with the target drug, biological fluids, immune system, vasculature, and cell membranes, all affecting therapeutic efficacy. Here, fundamental concepts in AI are described and the contributions and promise of nanotechnology coupled with AI to the future of precision cancer medicine are reviewed.", "Children with untreated sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) have impaired intellectual ability and behavioral effects. Timely treatment of SDB by adenotonsillectomy (AT) may prevent this morbidity. This study was designed to assess the prevalence of neurocognitive and behavioral dysfunction in Indian children with SDB and to evaluate the impact of AT.\nChildren recruited underwent diagnostic polysomnography (PSG), a detailed neurocognitive and behavioral assessment using a battery of validated instruments - the Malin's Intelligence Scale (MIS) for Indian children, Modified Wisconsin's Card Sorting Test, Parent Conners' Scale, and the Childhood Behavior Checklist (6-18). These children then underwent AT and subsequent reassessment at 3 and 6 months.\nNeurocognitive impairment was common among the 33 enrolled children (mean age 9 [\u00b12.97] years; 78.8% males). There was a significant correlation between the lowest O2saturation and the \"categories completed\" (r = -0.379; P = 0.029); and the lowest O2saturation and the \"failure to maintain sets\" (r = 0.386; P = 0.026) of the Modified Wisconsin's Card Sorting Test. Postsurgery, although apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) significantly decreased after surgery, 15 children still had SDB. Mean scores of most of the tested neurocognitive and behavioral domains showed improvement, although residual deficits were prevalent even after 6 months. Patients with a baseline AHI >5/h and those who had complete resolution of SDB (postoperative AHI <1/h) showed improvement in more subscales than patients with baseline AHI < 5/h and patients with incomplete resolution of SDB.\nThe decreased neurocognitive performance related to SDB may be a result of hypoxemia, rather than the frequency of SDB events. Despite AT, residual disease is common and such patients may require further treatment.", "Childhood maltreatment and its influence on mental health are key concerns around the world. Previous studies have found that childhood maltreatment is a positive predictor of mental symptoms, but few studies have been done to explore the specific mediating mechanisms between these two variables. Previous studies have found that there is a negative correlation between childhood maltreatment and emotional intelligence and between childhood maltreatment and social support, both of which are strong indicators of mental symptoms. Therefore, in this study, we took emotional intelligence and social support as mediating variables, exploring their mediating effects between childhood maltreatment and mental symptoms via the structural equation modeling method. We recruited 811 Chinese college students to complete the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the Symptom Checklist 90 Scale (SCL-90), the Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS), and the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS). The results showed a significant and positive correlation between childhood maltreatment and mental symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.26, P < 0.001); meanwhile, social support played a significant mediating role in the influence of childhood maltreatment on emotional intelligence [95% confidence intervals, (-0.594 to -0.327)]; and emotional intelligence likewise played a significant mediating role in the effect of social support on mental symptoms [95% confidence intervals, (-0.224 to -0.105)]. These results indicated that childhood maltreatment not only directly increases the likelihood of developing mental symptoms, but also affects emotional intelligence through influencing social support and then indirectly increasing the likelihood of developing mental symptoms. This study provided a theoretical basis for ameliorating adverse effects of childhood maltreatment on mental symptoms by enhancing emotional intelligence and social support.", "Artificial intelligence (AI), and, in particular, deep learning as a subcategory of AI, provides opportunities for the discovery and development of innovative drugs. Various machine learning approaches have recently (re)emerged, some of which may be considered instances of domain-specific AI which have been successfully employed for drug discovery and design. This review provides a comprehensive portrayal of these machine learning techniques and of their applications in medicinal chemistry. After introducing the basic principles, alongside some application notes, of the various machine learning algorithms, the current state-of-the art of AI-assisted pharmaceutical discovery is discussed, including applications in structure- and ligand-based virtual screening, de novo drug design, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic property prediction, drug repurposing, and related aspects. Finally, several challenges and limitations of the current methods are summarized, with a view to potential future directions for AI-assisted drug discovery and design.", "In Japan, the revision of the Copyright Act and the Unfair Competition Prevention Act has been made toward the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and data. The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry have issued \"Contract guidelines on the use of AI data\" and other rules are being developed. In the medical field, in addition to these general rules, it is important to protect patient rights and to protect intellectual property for appropriate evaluation of medical personnel for data creation.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic in digital health, as automated systems are being adopted throughout the health care system. Because they are still flexible, emerging technologies can be shaped significantly by media representations as well as public engagement with science. In this context, we examine the belief that negative news media coverage of AI-and specifically, the alleged use of imagery from the movie Terminator-is to blame for public concerns about AI. This belief is identified as a potential barrier to meaningful engagement of AI scientists and technology developers with journalists and the broader public. We name this climate of risk perception the \"Terminator Syndrome\"-not because of its origins in the movie of the same name per se, but because such unchecked beliefs can terminate broad public engagement on AI before they even begin. Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study examined the hypothesis that the news media coverage of AI is negative. We conducted a sentiment analysis of news data spanning over six decades, from 1956 to 2018, using the Google Cloud Natural Language API Sentiment Analysis tool. Contrary to the alleged negative sentiment in news media coverage of AI, we found that the available evidence does not support this claim. We conclude with an innovation policy-relevant discussion on the current state of AI risk perceptions, and what critical social sciences offer for responsible AI innovation in digital health, life sciences, and society.", "The involvement of the cerebellum in visuospatial abilities has been evidenced in numerous studies, based on the cerebellar-cortical circuitry. This domain has been evaluated in several patients with cerebellar disorders, but the assessment of visuospatial processing in Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) is scarce. The aim of this study is to analyze the visuospatial performance between CM-I adult patients and healthy controls. Participants have been tested using Block Design and Visual Puzzles subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), the Benton Judgment of Line Orientation test, and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test. The anxious-depressive symptomatology, the physical pain, and the premorbid intelligence have been controlled for, as well. The CM-I patients showed a significantly lower performance; however, after analyzing and controlling for the effect of clinical variables and psychopathological symptomatology, the main effect was maintained for visual puzzles and line orientation tasks. The findings suggest that CM-I patients show a poorer performance in tasks that require an exercise of perceptual reasoning without motor demand, accompanied by visualization and mental imagery of the stimuli. This study contributes towards the reinforcement of the evidence on the cognitive alterations associated to CM-I.", "In recent years, there is increasing enthusiasm in the healthcare research community for artificial intelligence to provide big data analytics and augment decision making. One of the prime reasons for this is the enormous impact of deep learning for utilization of complex healthcare big data. Although deep learning is a powerful analytic tool for the complex data contained in electronic health records (EHRs), there are also limitations which can make the choice of deep learning inferior in some healthcare applications. In this paper, we give a brief overview of the limitations of deep learning illustrated through case studies done over the years aiming to promote the consideration of alternative analytic strategies for healthcare.", "Advances in computational and data sciences for data management, integration, mining, classification, filtering, visualization along with engineering innovations in medical devices have prompted demands for more comprehensive and coherent strategies to address the most fundamental questions in health care and medicine. Theory, methods, and models from artificial intelligence (AI) are changing the health care landscape in clinical and community settings and have already shown promising results in multiple applications in healthcare including, integrated health information systems, patient education, geocoding health data, social media analytics, epidemic and syndromic surveillance, predictive modeling and decision support, mobile health, and medical imaging (e.g. radiology and retinal image analyses). Health intelligence uses tools and methods from artificial intelligence and data science to provide better insights, reduce waste and wait time, and increase speed, service efficiencies, level of accuracy, and productivity in health care and medicine.", "The understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for motor imagery (MI) is essential for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and bioprosthetics. Our magnetoencephalographic (MEG) experiments with voluntary participants confirm the existence of two types of motor imagery, kinesthetic imagery (KI) and visual imagery (VI), distinguished by activation and inhibition of different brain areas in motor-related \u03b1- and \u03b2-frequency regions. Although the brain activity corresponding to MI is usually observed in specially trained subjects or athletes, we show that it is also possible to identify particular features of MI in untrained subjects. Similar to real movement, KI implies muscular sensation when performing an imaginary moving action that leads to event-related desynchronization (ERD) of motor-associated brain rhythms. By contrast, VI refers to visualization of the corresponding action that results in event-related synchronization (ERS) of \u03b1- and \u03b2-wave activity. A notable difference between KI and VI groups occurs in the frontal brain area. In particular, the analysis of evoked responses shows that in all KI subjects the activity in the frontal cortex is suppressed during MI, while in the VI subjects the frontal cortex is always active. The accuracy in classification of left-arm and right-arm MI using artificial intelligence is similar for KI and VI. Since untrained subjects usually demonstrate the VI imagery mode, the possibility to increase the accuracy for VI is in demand for BCIs. The application of artificial neural networks allows us to classify MI in raising right and left arms with average accuracy of 70% for both KI and VI using appropriate filtration of input signals. The same average accuracy is achieved by optimizing MEG channels and reducing their number to only 13.", "Offspring of individuals with schizophrenia (SZCOff) are at an increased risk for this disorder. Neuropsychological decline is a core feature of the disorder and researchers have reported increasing impairments in cognition during the prodromal phase in high-risk adolescents. Additionally, factors like the presence of prodromal symptoms or specific behavioral patterns could predict, together with neurocognitive functioning, the risk of conversion to severe mental disorders in SCZOff. This study aims to compare the neuropsychological functioning of a sample of 41 SCZOff children and adolescents and 105 community control offspring (CCOff) and to develop a prediction model to examine whether neuropsychological functioning, clinical and behavioral factors predict subsequent risk of severe mental disorders. We collected demographic, clinical and neuropsychological data. We found significant differences between groups in working memory, speed of processing, verbal memory and learning, visual memory and intelligence quotient (IQ). The socioeconomic status, verbal memory, working memory and positive prodromal symptoms predicted a significant proportion of the dependent variable variance. In conclusion, SCZOff showed neurocognitive impairments in several neuropsychological domains compared to CCOff. Neuropsychological functioning, environmental factors and positive prodromal symptoms could predict the risk of onset of severe mental disorders in SCZOff.", "Are cognitive and biological variables useful for predicting future behavioral outcomes?\nIn two independent groups, we measured a set of cognitive (fluid and crystallized intelligence, working memory, and attention control) and biological (cortical thickness and cortical surface area) variables on two occasions separated by six months, to predict behavioral outcomes of interest (performance on an adaptive version of the n-back task) measured twelve and eighteen months later. We followed three stages: discovery, validation, and generalization. In the discovery stage, cognitive/biological variables and the behavioral outcome of interest were assessed in a group of individuals (in-sample). In the validation stage, the cognitive and biological variables were related with a parallel version of the behavioral outcome assessed several months later. In the generalization stage, the validation findings were tested in an independent group of individuals (out-of-sample).\nThe key finding revealed that cortical surface area variations within the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex predict the behavioral outcome of interest in both groups, whereas the cognitive variables failed to show reliable predictive validity.\nIndividual differences in biological variables might predict future behavioral outcomes better than cognitive variables concurrently correlated with these behavioral outcomes.", "Low emotional intelligence (EI) may predispose individuals to applying maladaptive coping strategies. This may maintain anxious worrying, which is highly prevalent in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and may affect mental (MCS) and physical component summaries (PCS) of health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\nThe current study is a cross-sectional and cross-cultural survey.\nN\u00a0=\u00a0200 outpatients with CHF were recruited at cardiology institutes in Germany and Pakistan and assessed with self-report questionnaires.\nPath analysis (\u03c72 (4)\u00a0=\u00a07.59, p\u00a0=\u00a0.11, GFI\u00a0=\u00a0.99) revealed that the expected associations between low EI and lower SF-36 MCS and PCS of HRQoL were fully mediated by negative metacognition and maladaptive coping in the Pakistani sample (p's\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.05). The German sample applied different maladaptive coping strategies, which also led to lower MCS and PCS scores, but did not mediate a direct positive effect of EI on HRQoL.\nThe current findings support culture-independent validity of the metacognitive model but also reveal major cultural differences regarding the application and effect of specific maladaptive coping strategies. This has important implications for caregivers in a cross-cultural context and highlights the need for culture-specific tailoring of psychosocial interventions. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Worry, an integral component of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and highly comorbid in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients, contributes to anxiety and resulting stress as evident from metacognitive model of GAD. In addition, previous literature has also established the protective role of emotional intelligence (EI) against stress, thus maintaining quality of life. What does this study add? Cross-cultural (Pakistan vs. Germany) validation of the metacognitive model of GAD. Supportive evidence for the metacognitive model in patients with CHF. Mediation of maladaptive metacognitions and negative coping in the relationship of low trait EI and low health-related quality of life.", "Neurocritical care combines the management of extremely complex disease states with the inherent limitations of clinically assessing patients with brain injury. As the management of neurocritical care patients can be immensely complicated, the automation of data-collection and basic management by artificial intelligence systems have garnered interest.\nIn this opinion article, we highlight the potential artificial intelligence has in monitoring and managing several aspects of neurocritical care, specifically intracranial pressure, seizure monitoring, blood pressure, and ventilation.\nThe two major AI methods of analytical technique currently exist for analyzing critical care data: the model-based method and data driven method. Both of these methods have demonstrated an ability to analyze vast quantities of patient data, and we highlight the ways in which these modalities of artificial intelligence might one day play a role in neurocritical care.\nWhile none of these artificial intelligence systems are meant to replace the clinician's judgment, these systems have the potential to reduce healthcare costs and errors or delays in medical management.", "Physical employment standards (PES) ensure that candidates can demonstrate the physical capacity required to perform duties of work. However, movement competency, or an individual's movement strategy, can relate to injury risk and safety, and therefore should be considered in PES.\nDemonstrate the utility of using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect risk-potential of different movement strategies within PES.\nBiomechanical analysis was used to calculate peak flexion angles and peak extensor moment about the lumbar spine during participants' performance of a backboard lifting task. Lifts performed with relatively lower and higher exposure to postural and moment loading on the spine were characterized as \"low\" or \"high\" exposure, respectively. An AI model including principal component and linear discriminant analyses was then trained to detect and classify backboard lifts as \"low\" or \"high\".\nThe AI model accurately classified over 85% of lifts as \"low\" or \"high\" exposure using only motion data as an input.\nThis proof-of-principle demonstrates that movement competency can be assessed in PES using AI. Similar classification approaches could be used to improve the utility of PES as a musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) prevention tool by proactively identifying candidates at higher risk of MSD based on movement competency.", "Purpose The current article presents data from 2 studies on clinical groups of children referred for speech assessment. The aims of these studies are to validate the Computer Articulation Instrument (CAI) with the known-group validation method and to determine the differential diagnostic power of the resulting speech profiles. Method Study 1 examined known-group validity by comparing the scores of 93 children diagnosed with speech-language difficulties on the picture naming (PN) task of the CAI with intelligibility judgments given by speech-language pathologists. In Study 2, the speech profiles of 41 children diagnosed with speech sound disorders (SSDs), consisting of 4-6 factor scores extracted from the 4 tasks of the CAI, namely, PN, nonword imitation (NWI), word and nonword repetition, and maximum repetition rate (MRR), were validated against clinical judgments of severity of the SSD given by speech-language pathologists. Results In Study 1, a repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of intelligibility level on the PN performance of the CAI and there were highly significant correlations between intelligibility and PN performance in the expected direction. Neither intelligibility level nor PN performance was related to nonverbal intelligence and language scores. The analysis of variance and a series of t tests in Study 2 revealed significant differences between the moderate and severe groups for the CAI factors based on PN and NWI and the bisyllabic and trisyllabic sequences of MRR, but not for the factor word and nonword proportion of whole-word variability based on word and nonword repetition, and the monosyllabic sequences of MRR. These results suggest that, especially, the tasks PN, NWI, and the bisyllabic and trisyllabic sequences of MRR are most sensitive for diagnosing SSDs. Conclusions The findings of these 2 studies support the known-group validity of the CAI. Together with the results of a previous study of our group on reliability and validity ( van Haaften et al., 2019 ), we can conclude that the CAI is a reliable and valid tool for assessment of children with SSDs.", "This study aims to explore the influence mechanism of cultural intelligence on work-family conflict for Chinese expatriates in cross-cultural non-profit organizations. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, this longitudinal study (six-month time lag) is the first to examine cultural intelligence as an antecedent of work-family conflict. The study also examines the mediating role of work engagement and the moderating role of leader-member exchange (LMX) in the cultural intelligence and work-family conflict relationship. The sample comprises 206 expatriate Chinese language teachers working at 45 Confucius Institutes in the US, Canada, and Russia. Results show that cultural intelligence not only reduces work-family conflict but also promotes expatriates' work engagement. The higher the work engagement, the higher the work-family conflict experienced by expatriates. LMX moderates not only the positive relationship between work engagement and work-family conflict but also the indirect effect of cultural intelligence on work-family conflict through work engagement. Thus, the indirect effect of cultural intelligence on work-family conflict through work engagement is stronger with low (compared to high) LMX. This study's findings provide implications for managers of cross-cultural non-profit organizations to better understand and solve expatriates' work-family conflict problem.", "This study aimed to develop and validate deep-learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm for predicting mortality of AHF (DAHF).\n12,654 dataset from 2165 patients with AHF in two hospitals were used as train data for DAHF development, and 4759 dataset from 4759 patients with AHF in 10 hospitals enrolled to the Korean AHF registry were used as performance test data. The endpoints were in-hospital, 12-month, and 36-month mortality. We compared the DAHF performance with the Get with the Guidelines-Heart Failure (GWTG-HF) score, Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) score, and other machine-learning models by using the test data. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the DAHF were 0.880 (95% confidence interval, 0.876-0.884) for predicting in-hospital mortality; these results significantly outperformed those of the GWTG-HF (0.728 [0.720-0.737]) and other machine-learning models. For predicting 12- and 36-month endpoints, DAHF (0.782 and 0.813) significantly outperformed MAGGIC score (0.718 and 0.729). During the 36-month follow-up, the high-risk group, defined by the DAHF, had a significantly higher mortality rate than the low-risk group(p<0.001).\nDAHF predicted the in-hospital and long-term mortality of patients with AHF more accurately than the existing risk scores and other machine-learning models.", "Experiencing potentially traumatic events (PTEs) is associated with deficits in cognitive functioning for youth. Previous research has demonstrated that PTE type may influence the association between PTE experiences and intelligence, such that IQ scores may differ by the type of PTE experienced. Additionally, mixed findings in the literature suggest that these associations might differ by age. The current study examined the association between PTE type and IQ and how age may moderate this association. In a sample of youth in foster care (N = 328, Mage = 13.25), physical, psychological, and sexual abuse and family PTEs were directly associated with verbal and nonverbal IQ. Age significantly moderated the association between IQ and neglect and academic PTEs. Results suggest that broad PTE grouping methods or failing to account for both maltreatment and general PTEs in samples of youth in foster care may conceal differences in how PTEs relate to intellectual functioning.", "Current generation electronic health records suffer a number of problems that make them inefficient and associated with poor clinical satisfaction. Digital scribes or intelligent documentation support systems, take advantage of advances in speech recognition, natural language processing and artificial intelligence, to automate the clinical documentation task currently conducted by humans. Whilst in their infancy, digital scribes are likely to evolve through three broad stages. Human led systems task clinicians with creating documentation, but provide tools to make the task simpler and more effective, for example with dictation support, semantic checking and templates. Mixed-initiative systems are delegated part of the documentation task, converting the conversations in a clinical encounter into summaries suitable for the electronic record. Computer-led systems are delegated full control of documentation and only request human interaction when exceptions are encountered. Intelligent clinical environments permit such augmented clinical encounters to occur in a fully digitised space where the environment becomes the computer. Data from clinical instruments can be automatically transmitted, interpreted using AI and entered directly into the record. Digital scribes raise many issues for clinical practice, including new patient safety risks. Automation bias may see clinicians automatically accept scribe documents without checking. The electronic record also shifts from a human created summary of events to potentially a full audio, video and sensor record of the clinical encounter. Digital scribes promisingly offer a gateway into the clinical workflow for more advanced support for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tasks.", "The process of learning new behaviors over time is a problem of great interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, most standard analyses of animal training data either treat behavior as fixed or track only coarse performance statistics (e.g., accuracy, bias), providing limited insight into the evolution of the policies governing behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dynamic psychophysical model that efficiently tracks trial-to-trial changes in behavior over the course of training. Our model consists of a dynamic logistic regression model, parametrized by a set of time-varying weights that express dependence on sensory stimuli as well as task-irrelevant covariates, such as stimulus, choice, and answer history. Our implementation scales to large behavioral datasets, allowing us to infer 500K parameters (e.g., 10 weights over 50K trials) in minutes on a desktop computer. We optimize hyperparameters governing how rapidly each weight evolves over time using the decoupled Laplace approximation, an efficient method for maximizing marginal likelihood in non-conjugate models. To illustrate performance, we apply our method to psychophysical data from both rats and human subjects learning a delayed sensory discrimination task. The model successfully tracks the psychophysical weights of rats over the course of training, capturing day-to-day and trial-to-trial fluctuations that underlie changes in performance, choice bias, and dependencies on task history. Finally, we investigate why rats frequently make mistakes on easy trials, and suggest that apparent lapses can be explained by sub-optimal weighting of known task covariates.", "A curriculum was planned using modern concepts based on the \"old\" principles to test if such an educational intervention provided pupils with good mental health and a solid basis for good reading and writing skills, as well as generated a positive attitude to learn. These \"old\" principles were based on previous knowledge derived from school psychiatry (which in Sweden was a branch of child and adolescent psychiatry 1915-1970), educational psychology and the educational approach from the differentiating Swedish School system of 1946-1970 (itself based on the principles of curative education \"Heilp\u00e4dagogie\", which was later renamed mental health care).\nAll six available schools in the small Swedish city of S\u00e4vsj\u00f6 participated in the study. In these six schools there were eight preschool classes that included every 6-year old child living in the city. In total there were 184 families with 186 children (including 2 pairs of twins) who belonged to these preschool classes and were invited to take part in the study. One family moved just before school-start and 8 decided not to participate, thus 177 children (84 boys and 93 girls, aged 5.6-6.6\u00a0years) entered the study. The preschool classes were randomized into an experimental group with four preschool classes and a comparison group with four preschool classes. The experimental group followed a teaching program from the start of the preschool year until the end of grade 3 that was tailored to each student's individual capacity based on the concepts of school maturation and curative education used in the Swedish schools during the period 1946-1970. The comparison group followed today's average Swedish school curriculum. The project was planned as an intervention study covering the preschool year and the first 3\u00a0years of elementary school, which was to form a basis for a follow-up when the pupils had left senior high, the 12th year in Swedish public school. The outcome and the achievements were measured at end of grade 3 using standardized tests on reading, writing and mathematical skills. Behavior was assessed at school start and at end of grade 3 using the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL-scales) in addition to a questionnaire on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) with criteria from DSM-IV. The children made a self-evaluation of their attitude towards learning.\nAt the end of school year 3, the children in the experimental group had an improved reading capacity (p\u2009=\u20090.002, effect size(es)\u2009=\u20094.35) and reading comprehension (p\u2009=\u20090.03, es\u2009=\u20090.04). They evaluated their own reading (p\u2009=\u20090.02, es\u2009=\u20090.23), writing (p\u2009=\u20090.007, es\u2009=\u20090.35) and mathematical skills (p\u2009=\u20090.003, es\u2009=\u20090.48) as going \"very well\" when compared to comparison group. Differences regarding intelligence quotas between the groups at the start of school had disappeared by the end of grade 3. No differences referring to CBCL were found at end of grade 3. One child in the comparison group fulfilled criteria for AD/HD, according to parents and teachers.\nThe alternative curriculum covering the preschool year through the first 3\u00a0years of elementary school based on the old principles from curative education (\"Heilp\u00e4dagogie\"), educational psychology and school psychiatry gave the children in the experimental group a better reading capacity and reading comprehension.Trial registration The study started in 1998. The data were collected longitudinally and prospectively but have not been analyzed until now, with the children having left senior high. A retrospective registration in the ISRCTN is pending.", "Infertility is a global health concern, and couples are increasingly seeking medical assistance to achieve reproduction. Semen analysis is a primary assessment performed by a clinician, in which the morphology of the sperm population is evaluated. Machine learning algorithms that automate, standardize, and expedite sperm classification are the subject of ongoing research.\nWe demonstrate a deep learning method to classify sperm into one of several World Health Organization (WHO) shape-based categories. Our method uses VGG16, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) initially trained on ImageNet, a collection of human-annotated everyday images, which we retrain for sperm classification using two freely-available sperm head datasets (HuSHeM and SCIAN).\nOur deep learning approach classifies sperm at high accuracy and performs well in head-to-head comparisons with earlier approaches using identical datasets. We demonstrate improvement in true positive rate over a classifier approach based on a cascade ensemble of support vector machines (CE-SVM) and show similar true positive rates as compared to an adaptive patch-based dictionary learning (APDL) method. Retraining an off-the-shelf VGG16 network avoids excessive neural network computation or having to learn and use the massive dictionaries required for sparse representation, both of which can be computationally expensive.\nWe show that our deep learning approach to sperm head classification represents a viable method to automate, standardize, and accelerate semen analysis. Our approach highlights the potential of artificial intelligence technologies to eventually exceed human experts in terms of accuracy, reliability, and throughput.", "Various techniques using artificial intelligence (AI) have resulted in a significant contribution to field of medical image and video-based diagnoses, such as radiology, pathology, and endoscopy, including the classification of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Most previous studies on the classification of GI diseases use only spatial features, which demonstrate low performance in the classification of multiple GI diseases. Although there are a few previous studies using temporal features based on a three-dimensional convolutional neural network, only a specific part of the GI tract was involved with the limited number of classes. To overcome these problems, we propose a comprehensive AI-based framework for the classification of multiple GI diseases by using endoscopic videos, which can simultaneously extract both spatial and temporal features to achieve better classification performance. Two different residual networks and a long short-term memory model are integrated in a cascaded mode to extract spatial and temporal features, respectively. Experiments were conducted on a combined dataset consisting of one of the largest endoscopic videos with 52,471 frames. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed classification framework for multi-GI diseases. The experimental results of the proposed model (97.057% area under the curve) demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods and indicate its potential for clinical applications.", "Counterfeit luxury fashion goods have rarely been the subject of scientific studies. Very little is known about the mechanisms of this illicit market despite the apparent prevalence and their adverse consequences. Counterfeit watches remain one of the preferred targets in the luxury goods segment. The study of marks or traces in a forensic intelligence perspective can contribute to an improved understanding of the phenomenon. The aim of our research was to highlight different types of links that can be drawn between specimens of counterfeit watches, to carry out a thorough study of the information conveyed by the revealed links, to study their complementarity and to get an understanding of the intelligence that can be produced from these pieces of information. Thirty-five counterfeit watches of a commonly counterfeit watch brand including seven popular models were studied in this research. Chemical and physical links were found that corroborated existing knowledge and also revealed new connections between different seizures or specimens. The comparison of chemical and physical features combined with spatiotemporal information on the seized watches enabled us to produce intelligence disclosing possible aspects of the structure and the organisation of production and distribution channels. We were able to reveal or confirm links between watches that were previously unknown or uncertain and demonstrated the interconnection of all watches on a chemical and/or physical level, suggesting an overhead organised network with substructures. Despite the limited set of specimens that was considered, this study illustrates that forensic intelligence on this illicit market can be used to support consistent decision-making from all the key-players involved in the anti-counterfeiting process.", "Advances in embedded electronic systems, the development of new communication protocols, and the application of artificial intelligence paradigms have enabled the improvement of current automation systems of energy management. Embedded devices integrate different sensors with connectivity, computing resources, and reduced cost. Communication and cloud services increase their performance; however, there are limitations in the implementation of these technologies. If the cloud is used as the main source of services and resources, overload problems will occur. There are no models that facilitate the complete integration and interoperability in the facilities already created. This article proposes a model for the integration of smart energy management systems in new and already created facilities, using local embedded devices, Internet of Things communication protocols and services based on artificial intelligence paradigms. All services are distributed in the new smart grid network using edge and fog computing techniques. The model proposes an architecture both to be used as support for the development of smart services and for energy management control systems adapted to the installation: a group of buildings and/or houses that shares energy management and energy generation. Machine learning to predict consumption and energy generation, electric load classification, energy distribution control, and predictive maintenance are the main utilities integrated. As an experimental case, a facility that incorporates wind and solar generation is used for development and testing. Smart grid facilities, designed with artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented with Internet of Things protocols, and embedded control devices facilitate the development, cost reduction, and the integration of new services. In this work, a method to design, develop, and install smart services in self-consumption facilities is proposed. New smart services with reduced costs are installed and tested, confirming the advantages of the proposed model.", "Several biopsychosocial changes in individuals' life might happen, resulting in a decline of long-term cognitive abilities. In this way, the aim of this study was to compare cognition in non-clinical older adults in Brazil during a four-year period, as well as to examine which variables may explain cognitive function variations identified during this time. For this purpose, a longitudinal study was developed including 108 older Brazilians in phase I and 64 in phase II, from 2013 to 2017. Socio-demographic variables were assessed and the following instruments were administered: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) - 3rd Edition - Digital Symbol-Coding subtests, the Verbal Fluency Test (animal category), the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version (GDS-15). In order to compare cognitive variables, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for repeated measures was used. Temporal comparisons of nominal variables were carried out using McNemar's chi-square tests for matched pairs. Finally, multiple linear regression and correlation analyses were applied, using the participants' cognitive performance variation scores (\u0394) as dependent variables. Global cognitive function delayed verbal episodic memory, and processing speed experienced a significant decline in four years. Symptoms of anxiety were the main predictor of cognitive performance variations in this sample.", "There is a lack of research studying patient-generated data on Reddit, one of the world's most popular forums with active users interested in dermatology. Techniques within natural language processing, a field of artificial intelligence, can analyze large amounts of text information and extract insights.\nTo apply natural language processing to Reddit comments about dermatology topics to assess for feasibility and potential for insights and engagement.\nA software pipeline preprocessed Reddit comments from 2005 to 2017 from 7 popular dermatology-related subforums on Reddit, applied latent Dirichlet\u00a0allocation, and used spectral clustering to establish cohesive themes and the frequency of word representation and grouped terms within these topics.\nWe created a corpus of 176,000 comments and identified trends in patient engagement in spaces such as eczema and acne, among others, with a focus on homeopathic treatments and isotretinoin.\nLatent Dirichlet\u00a0allocation is an unsupervised model, meaning there is no ground truth to which the model output can be compared. However, because these forums are anonymous, there seems little incentive for patients to be dishonest.\nReddit data has viability and utility for dermatologic research and engagement with the public, especially for common dermatology topics such as tanning, acne, and psoriasis.", "The rise of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has engendered considerable excitement, claiming to improve approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Amidst the enthusiasm, the philosophical assumptions that underlie the big data and AI movement in medicine are rarely examined. This essay outlines three philosophical challenges faced by this movement: (1) the epistemological-ontological problem arising from the theory-ladenness of big data and measurement; (2) the epistemological-logical problem resulting from the inherent limitations of algorithms and attendant issues of reliability and interpretability; and (3) the phenomenological problem concerning the irreducibility of human experience to quantitative data. These philosophical issues demonstrate several important challenges for these technologies that must be considered prior to their integration into clinical care. Our article aims to initiate a critical dialogue on the impact of big data and AI in health care in order to allow for more robust evaluation of these technologies and to aid in the development of approaches to clinical care that better serve clinicians and their patients.", "In recent years there have been great strides in artificial intelligence (AI), with games often serving as challenge problems, benchmarks, and milestones for progress. Poker has served for decades as such a challenge problem. Past successes in such benchmarks, including poker, have been limited to two-player games. However, poker in particular is traditionally played with more than two players. Multiplayer games present fundamental additional issues beyond those in two-player games, and multiplayer poker is a recognized AI milestone. In this paper we present Pluribus, an AI that we show is stronger than top human professionals in six-player no-limit Texas hold'em poker, the most popular form of poker played by humans.", "We report a self-consistent method to translate amino acid sequences into audible sound, use the representation in the musical space to train a neural network, and then apply it to generate protein designs using artificial intelligence (AI). The sonification method proposed here uses the normal mode vibrations of the amino acid building blocks of proteins to compute an audible representation of each of the 20 natural amino acids, which is fully defined by the overlay of its respective natural vibrations. The vibrational frequencies are transposed to the audible spectrum following the musical concept of transpositional equivalence, playing or writing music in a way that makes it sound higher or lower in pitch while retaining the relationships between tones or chords played. This transposition method ensures that the relative values of the vibrational frequencies within each amino acid and among different amino acids are retained. The characteristic frequency spectrum and sound associated with each of the amino acids represents a type of musical scale that consists of 20 tones, the \"amino acid scale\". To create a playable instrument, each tone associated with the amino acids is assigned to a specific key on a piano roll, which allows us to map the sequence of amino acids in proteins into a musical score. To reflect higher-order structural details of proteins, the volume and duration of the notes associated with each amino acid are defined by the secondary structure of proteins, computed using DSSP and thereby introducing musical rhythm. We then train a recurrent neural network based on a large set of musical scores generated by this sonification method and use AI to generate musical compositions, capturing the innate relationships between amino acid sequence and protein structure. We then translate the de novo musical data generated by AI into protein sequences, thereby obtaining de novo protein designs that feature specific design characteristics. We illustrate the approach in several examples that reflect the sonification of protein sequences, including multihour audible representations of natural proteins and protein-based musical compositions solely generated by AI. The approach proposed here may provide an avenue for understanding sequence patterns, variations, and mutations and offers an outreach mechanism to explain the significance of protein sequences. The method may also offer insight into protein folding and understanding the context of the amino acid sequence in defining the secondary and higher-order folded structure of proteins and could hence be used to detect the effects of mutations through sound.", "The arcuate fasciculus (AF) has been implicated in its association with intelligence. Probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data provides isolation of white matter tracts between two distant cortical structures. In this study, we performed probabilistic tractography between Wernicke's and Broca's area in the left and right hemisphere, to examine the association of the arcuate fasciculus's integrity with age and intelligence, using DTI data from 488 individuals whose age ranges between 6 to 85\u00a0years. The left, but not right, AF showed significant decline with age. Both left and right AF showed significant association with the full-scale IQ measured by the Wechsler Abbreviated Intelligence Scale. Both fasciculi showed significant association with the subscale verbal IQ, but only the left showed performance IQ. This study demonstrates that the bilateral arcuate fasciculi are associated with IQ; left vs. right asymmetry is present in its aging and function.", "Assessing job applicants' general mental ability online poses psychometric challenges due to the necessity of having brief but accurate tests. Recent research (Myszkowski & Storme, 2018) suggests that recovering distractor information through Nested Logit Models (NLM; Suh & Bolt, 2010) increases the reliability of ability estimates in reasoning matrix-type tests. In the present research, we extended this result to a different context (online intelligence testing for recruitment) and in a larger sample ( N = 2949 job applicants). We found that the NLMs outperformed the Nominal Response Model (Bock, 1970) and provided significant reliability gains compared with their binary logistic counterparts. In line with previous research, the gain in reliability was especially obtained at low ability levels. Implications and practical recommendations are discussed.", "Although artificial intelligence has been available for some time, it has garnered significant interest recently and has been popularized by major companies with its applications in image identification, speech recognition and problem solving. Artificial intelligence is now being increasingly studied for its potential uses in medicine. A sound understanding of the concepts of this emerging field is essential for the dermatologist as dermatology has abundant medical data and images that can be used to train artificial intelligence for patient care. There are already a number of artificial intelligence studies focusing on skin disorders such as skin cancer, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and onychomycosis. This article aims to present a basic introduction to the concepts of artificial intelligence as well as\u00a0present an overview of the current research into artificial intelligence in dermatology, examining both its current applications and its future potential.", "Conventional photosensing devices work mainly by electron processing and transport, while visual systems in intelligence work by integrative ion/electron signals. To realize smarter photodetectors, some photoionic device or the combination of ionic and electronic devices are necessary. Now, an ion-transport-based self-powered photodetector is presented based on an asymmetric carbon nitride nanotube membrane, which can realize fast, selective, and stable light detection while being self-powered. Local charges are continuously generated at the irradiated side of the membrane, and none (fewer) at the non-irradiated side. The resulting surface charge gradient in carbon nitride nanotube will drive ion transport in the cavity, thus realizing the function of ionic photodetector. With advantages of low cost and easy fabrication process, the concept of ionic photodetectors based on carbon nitride anticipates wide applications for semiconductor biointerfaces.", "During the in vitro culture of plants some physiological disorders caused major problems that have been associated with culture media composition. The objective of this study was to better understand the abnormal physiological response of two pistachio rootstocks to changes in culture media ingredients. On this purpose, two computer-based tools were employed: design of experiment (DOE) and neurofuzzy logic. DOE was employed to generate a five-dimensional IV-design spaces allowing to reduce the number of treatments from 6,250 to 61. The second one, an artificial intelligence (AI) tool, neurofuzzy logic, was used to understand the cause-effect relationships between the factors studied (25) and seven physiological disorders including shoot-tip necrosis (STN), leaf necrosis (LN), leaf color (LC), basal callus (BC) formation, shoot fasciation (SF), hyperhydricity and epinasty, typically described during pistachio in vitro culture. Four out of the seven disorders were successfully modeled, being significantly affected by a limited number of factors. STN and BC were significantly affected by the concentration of EDTA-. However, while a low concentration of EDTA- reduces the STN, promotes BC. LN and LC were strongly alleviated by high amounts of thiamine-HCl. Undoubtedly, the results demonstrate the importance of recording and using data related to physiological disorders along with growth parameters when developing suitable culture media for plant tissues. The computer-based tools have been useful to: i) well sample experimental design; ii) reduce the final number of treatments and the experimental work; iii) identify the key factors affecting each disorder; iv) get insight about the causes that promote the appearance of physiological disorders. Our findings demonstrate that the recently AI designed POM media, although not optimal, is the most suitable (favouring growth and limiting physiological abnormalities) media for in vitro culture of pistachio compared to those media, currently used.", "Cerebrovascular accident due to carotid artery disease is the most common cause of death in developed countries following heart disease and cancer. For a reliable early detection of atherosclerosis, Intima Media Thickness (IMT) measurement and classification are important. A new method for decision support purpose for the classification of IMT was proposed in this study. Ultrasound images are used for IMT measurements. Images are classified and evaluated by experts. This is a manual procedure, so it causes subjectivity and variability in the IMT classification. Instead, this article proposes a methodology based on artificial intelligence methods for IMT classification. For this purpose, a deep learning strategy with multiple hidden layers has been developed. In order to create the proposed model, convolutional neural network algorithm, which is frequently used in image classification problems, is used. 501 ultrasound images from 153 patients were used to test the model. The images are classified by two specialists, then the model is trained and tested on the images, and the results are explained. The deep learning model in the study achieved an accuracy of 89.1% in the IMT classification with 89% sensitivity and 88% specificity. Thus, the assessments in this paper have shown that this methodology performs reasonable results for IMT classification.", "As the health care industry adopts artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other modeling techniques, it is seeing benefits to both patient outcomes and cost reduction; however, it needs to be cognizant of and ensure proper management of the risks, including bias. Lessons learned from other industries may provide a framework for acknowledging and managing data, machine, and human biases that arise while implementing AI.", "Central nervous system tumors are the most frequent solid neoplasms in childhood and are frequently located in posterior fossa (PF). In Brazil, this diagnosis is associated to high mortality rates and this context is increasingly worrisome outside of large urban centers in which delayed diagnosis and defaulting from treatment compromise survivorship. Moreover, the lesion and therapeutic toxicity compromise cognitive domains. This study investigated the impact of PF tumors and their treatments on the intellectual capacity of 37 children and adolescents aged 6 to 16, divided into two groups: patients with low grade tumors, submitted only to neurosurgery (G1) and with tumors of higher malignancy submitted to neurosurgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy (G2). Using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children, data reveal that G1 presented preserved mean performance, while G2 presented low average performance. Cluster-type analysis divided the participants into two groups regarding intelligence, clinical and sociodemographic variables. Inferential statistical analysis highlighted the influence of antineoplastic treatment on nonverbal domains. Mother's schooling demonstrated influence on verbal domains, revealing an important dissociation pattern. The results suggest the relevance of sociocultural factors on the expression of the damage, as well as the administration of radiotherapy at critical neurodevelopmental stages.", "Past research has shown that emotional intelligence (EI) and core self-evaluations (CSE) have a unique and independent role in the prediction of psychological maladjustment in the unemployed population. However, no one to date has examined the joint contribution of EI and CSE in predicting well-being and psychological distress among the unemployed. Our objective was to examine the main and interactive role of EI and CSE in the prediction of indicators for happiness, depression, stress, and anxiety beyond socio-demographics variables.\nA sample of 1796 unemployed participants completed a battery that included socio-demographic data and questionnaires of EI, CSE, happiness, depression, stress, and anxiety. We processed the data with SPSS and Hayes PROCESS macro.\nPearson correlation analyses showed significant associations between EI and CSE with different mental health outcomes. Moderation analyses revealed that, beyond the main effects, the interactive term EI\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CSE increased the explained variance of the prediction of happiness, but not of depression, anxiety, or stress.\nThe study comprised an incidental non-clinical sample of unemployed adults, so the results might not generalize to a clinical population. Also, the study was cross-sectional, and we relied only on self-report measures, which do not allow for establishing causal links and might include biases, such as social desirability and common method variance.\nThese findings highlight the need for developing more comprehensive models including the interaction of EI and dispositional traits as contributing factors in the prediction of positive outcomes among the unemployed. Also, future promotion programs should include dimensions related to EI and CSE for increasing well-being during unemployment.", "To develop and assess AI algorithms to identify operative steps in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).\nComputer vision, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), allows for quantitative analysis of video by computers for identification of objects and patterns, such as in autonomous driving.\nIntraoperative video from LSG from an academic institution was annotated by 2 fellowship-trained, board-certified bariatric surgeons. Videos were segmented into the following steps: 1) port placement, 2) liver retraction, 3) liver biopsy, 4) gastrocolic ligament dissection, 5) stapling of the stomach, 6) bagging specimen, and 7) final inspection of staple line. Deep neural networks were used to analyze videos. Accuracy of operative step identification by the AI was determined by comparing to surgeon annotations.\nEighty-eight cases of LSG were analyzed. A random 70% sample of these clips was used to train the AI and 30% to test the AI's performance. Mean concordance correlation coefficient for human annotators was 0.862, suggesting excellent agreement. Mean (\u00b1SD) accuracy of the AI in identifying operative steps in the test set was 82%\u200a\u00b1\u200a4% with a maximum of 85.6%.\nAI can extract quantitative surgical data from video with 85.6% accuracy. This suggests operative video could be used as a quantitative data source for research in intraoperative clinical decision support, risk prediction, or outcomes studies.", "In general, dreams are a novel but realistic simulation of waking social life, with a mixture of characters, motivations, scenarios, and positive and negative emotions. We propose that the sharing of dreams has an empathic effect on the dreamer and on significant others who hear and engage with the telling of the dream. Study 1 tests three correlations that are predicted by the theory of dream sharing and empathy: that trait empathy will be correlated with frequency of telling dreams to others, with frequency of listening to others' dreams, and with trait attitude toward dreams (ATD) (for which higher scores indicate positive attitude). 160 participants completed online the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire and the Mannheim Dream Questionnaire. Pearson partial correlations were conducted, with age and sex partialled out. Trait empathy was found to be significantly associated with the frequency of listening to the dreams of others, frequency of telling one's own dreams to others, and attitude toward dreams. Study 2 tests the effects of discussing dreams on state empathy, using an adapted version of the Shen (2010) state empathy scale, for 27 pairs of dream sharers and discussers. Dream discussion followed the stages of the Ullman (1996) dream appreciation technique. State empathy of the dream discusser toward the dream sharer was found to increase significantly as a result of the dream discussion, with a medium effect size, whereas the dream sharer had a small decrease in empathy toward the discusser. A proposed mechanism for these associations and effects is taken from the robust findings in the literature that engagement with literary fiction can induce empathy toward others. We suggest that the dream acts as a piece of fiction that can be explored by the dreamer together with other people, and can thus induce empathy about the life circumstances of the dreamer. We discuss the speculation that the story-like characteristics of adult human dreams may have been selected for in human evolution, including in sexual selection, as part of the selection for emotional intelligence, empathy, and social bonding.", "Recent developments in artificial intelligence technology has facilitated advances in neuromorphic computing. Electrical elements mimicking the role of synapses are crucial building blocks for neuromorphic computers. Although various types of two-terminal memristive devices have emerged in the mainstream of synaptic devices, a hetero-synaptic artificial synapse, i.e., one with modulatable plasticity induced by multiple connections of synapses, is intriguing. Here, a synaptic device with tunable synapse plasticity is presented that is based on a simple four-terminal rutile TiO2-x single-crystal memristor. In this device, the oxygen vacancy distribution in TiO2-x and the associated bulk carrier conduction can be used to control the resistance of the device. There are two diagonally arranged pairs of electrodes with distinct functions: one for the read/write operation, the other for the gating operation. This arrangement enables precise control of the oxygen vacancy distribution. Microscopic analysis of the Ti valence states in the device reveals the origin of resistance switching phenomena to be an electrically driven redistribution of oxygen vacancies with no changes in crystal structure. Tuning protocols for the write and the gate voltage applications enable high precision control of resistance, or synaptic plasticity, paving the way for the manipulation of learning efficiency through neuromorphic devices.", "Bone mineral density (BMD) is an important consideration during fusion surgery. Although dual X-ray absorptiometry is considered as the gold standard for assessing BMD, quantitative computed tomography (QCT) provides more accurate data in spine osteoporosis. However, QCT has the disadvantage of additional radiation hazard and cost. The present study was to demonstrate the utility of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithm for assessing osteoporosis using Hounsfield units (HU) of preoperative lumbar CT coupling with data of QCT.\nWe reviewed 70 patients undergoing both QCT and conventional lumbar CT for spine surgery. The T-scores of 198 lumbar vertebra was assessed in QCT and the HU of vertebral body at the same level were measured in conventional CT by the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) system. A multiple regression algorithm was applied to predict the T-score using three independent variables (age, sex, and HU of vertebral body on conventional CT) coupling with T-score of QCT. Next, a logistic regression algorithm was applied to predict osteoporotic or non-osteoporotic vertebra. The Tensor flow and Python were used as the machine learning tools. The Tensor flow user interface developed in our institute was used for easy code generation.\nThe predictive model with multiple regression algorithm estimated similar T-scores with data of QCT. HU demonstrates the similar results as QCT without the discordance in only one non-osteoporotic vertebra that indicated osteoporosis. From the training set, the predictive model classified the lumbar vertebra into two groups (osteoporotic vs. non-osteoporotic spine) with 88.0% accuracy. In a test set of 40 vertebrae, classification accuracy was 92.5% when the learning rate was 0.0001 (precision, 0.939; recall, 0.969; F1 score, 0.954; area under the curve, 0.900).\nThis study is a simple machine learning model applicable in the spine research field. The machine learning model can predict the T-score and osteoporotic vertebrae solely by measuring the HU of conventional CT, and this would help spine surgeons not to under-estimate the osteoporotic spine preoperatively. If applied to a bigger data set, we believe the predictive accuracy of our model will further increase. We propose that machine learning is an important modality of the medical research field.", "End-of-life care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is one of the most challenging practices for nurses. Negative emotions associated with moral distress often cause care to be incomplete or nurse disengagement. Emotional intelligence in nurses holds potential to address this issue, while improving patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to critically appraise the evidence about emotional intelligence in nursing and to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence, moral distress in NICU nurses, end-of-life care, and other priority nurse and patient outcomes. A PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses)-structured integrative review was conducted, and CINAHL, Ovid, PubMed, and other databases were searched. Twelve studies were identified as relevant to this review after exclusion criteria were applied. Evidence supports the efficacy of emotional intelligence in bedside nurses as a method of improving key nurse and patient outcomes. Additionally, research suggests that emotional intelligence can be improved by training interventions. Clinical educators should integrate emotional intelligence concepts and strategies into staff training. Further research is recommended to validate previous findings in the NICU setting. Exploration of the relationship between emotional intelligence and moral distress in NICU nurses would provide a foundation for experimental designs to evaluate the effectiveness of emotional intelligence training interventions.", "Life expectancy is rising in most parts of the world as is the prevalence of chronic diseases. Suboptimal adherence to long-term medications is still rather the norm than the exception, although it is well known that suboptimal adherence compromises the therapeutic effectiveness. Information and communications technology provides new concepts for improving adherence to medications. These so-called telehealth concepts or services help to implement closed-loop healthcare paradigms and to establish collaborative care networks involving all stakeholders relevant to optimising the overall medication therapy. Together with data from Electronic Health Records and Electronic Medical Records, these networks pave the way to data-driven decision support systems. Recent advances in machine learning, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence allow further steps towards fully autonomous telehealth systems. This might bring advances in the future: disburden healthcare professionals from repetitive tasks, enable them to timely react to critical situations, and offer a comprehensive overview of the patients' medication status. Advanced analytics can help to assess whether patients have taken their medications as prescribed, to improve adherence via automatic reminders. Ultimately, all relevant data sources need to be collated into a basis for data-driven methods, with the goal to assist healthcare professionals in guiding patients to obtain the best possible health status, with a reasonable resource utilisation and a risk-adjusted safety and privacy approach. This paper summarises the state-of-the-art of telehealth and artificial intelligence applications in medication management. It focuses on 3 major aspects: latest technologies, current applications, and patient related issues.", "Prior research suggests that physician attire has an important effect on patient perceptions, and can influence the patient-physician relationship. Previous studies have established the effect of specialty, location, and setting on patient preferences for physician attire, and the importance of these preferences and perceptions on both the physician-patient relationship and first impressions. To date, no studies have examined the influence of attire in the inpatient orthopaedic surgery setting on these perceptions.\n(1) Do differences in orthopaedic physician attire influence patient confidence in their surgeon, perception of trustworthiness, safety, how caring their physician is, how smart their surgeon is, how well the surgery would go, and how willing they are to discuss personal information with the surgeon? (2) Do patients perceive physicians who are men and women differently with respect to those endpoints?\nNinety-three of 110 patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery at an urban academic medical center participated in a three-part survey. In the first part, each patient was randomly presented 10 images of both men and women surgeons, each dressed in five different outfits: business attire (BA), a white coat over business attire (WB), scrubs alone (SA), a white coat over scrubs (WS), and casual attire (CA). Respondents rated each image on a five-point Likert scale regarding how confident, trustworthy, safe, caring, and smart the surgeon appeared, how well the surgery would go, and the patient's willingness to discuss personal information with the surgeon. In the second part, the respondent ranked all images, by gender, from the most to least confident based on attire.\nPair-wise comparisons for women surgeons demonstrated no difference in patient preference between white coat over business attire compared with white coat over scrubs or scrubs alone, though each was preferable to business attire and casual attire (WS versus WB: mean difference [MD], 0.1 \u00b1 0.6; 95% CI, 0.0-0.2; p = 1.0; WS versus SA: MD, 0.2 \u00b1 0.7; 95% CI, 0-0.3; p = 0.7; WB versus SA: 0.1 \u00b1 0.9; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; p = 1.0). The same results were found when rating the surgeon's perceived intelligence, skill, trust, confidentiality, caring, and safety. In the pair-wise comparisons for male surgeons, white coat over scrubs was not preferred to white coat over business attire, scrubs alone, or business attire (WS versus WB: MD, -0.1 \u00b1 0.6; 95% CI, 0-0.1; p = 1.0; WS versus SA: MD, 0 \u00b1 0.4; 95% CI, -0.2 to 0; p = 1.0; WS versus BA: MD, 0.2 \u00b1 0.8; 95% CI, 0-0.4; p = 0.6). WB and SA were not different (MD, 0.0 \u00b1 0.6; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; p = 1.0), though both were preferred to BA and CA (WB versus BA: MD, 0.3 \u00b1 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1-0.5; p = 0.02; WB versus CA: 1.0 \u00b1 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.2; p < 0.01). We found no difference between SA and BA (MD, 0.3 \u00b1 0.7; 95% CI, 0.1-0.4; p = 0.06). We found that each was preferred to CA (SA versus CA: 0.9 \u00b1 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.2; p < 0.01; BA versus CA: 0.7 \u00b1 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9; p < 0.01), with similar results in all other categories. When asked to rank all types of attire, patients preferred WS or WB for both men and women surgeons, followed by SA, BA, and CA.\nSimilar to findings in the outpatient orthopaedic setting, in the inpatient setting, we found patients had a moderate overall preference for physicians wearing a white coat, either over scrubs or business attire, and, to some extent, scrubs alone. Respondents did not show any difference in preference based on the gender of the pictured surgeon. For men and women orthopaedic surgeons in the urban inpatient setting, stereotypical physician's attire such as a white coat over either scrubs or business attire, or even scrubs alone may improve numerous components of the patient-physician relationship and should therefore be strongly considered to enhance overall patient care.\nLevel II, therapeutic study.", "The question whether body height is related to different brain size measures has recently gained renewed interest as some studies have reported that body height correlates with intelligence and several brain size measures. In this study, we re-evaluated this question by examining the relationship between body height and different brain size measures including intracranial volume, total brain volume, total cortical surface area, total cortical volume, volume of normal-appearing white matter, white matter hyperintensity, cortical surface area, cortical thickness, subcortical grey matter volume, cerebellar cortex and cerebellar white matter in a relatively large sample (n\u00a0=\u00a0216) of physically and cognitively healthy elderly subjects (mean age 71\u00a0years, age range 65-85\u00a0years). We identified small correlations (r\u00a0=\u00a0.11-.19) between body height and seven out of 10 brain metrics (total brain volume, cortical surface area, cortical volume, subcortical volume, normal-appearing white matter volume and cerebellar grey as well as white matter volumes) when controlling for sex and age. Based on these small relationships between body height and various brain size measures, we discuss the possible reasons and theoretical problems for these small relationships.", "Health care, in recent years, has made great leaps in integrating wireless technology into traditional models of care. The availability of ubiquitous devices such as wearable sensors has enabled researchers to collect voluminous datasets and harness them in a wide range of health care topics. One of the goals of using on-body wearable sensors has been to study and analyze human activity and functional patterns, thereby predicting harmful outcomes such as falls. It can also be used to track precise individual movements to form personalized behavioral patterns, to standardize the concept of frailty, well-being/independence, etc. Most wearable devices such as activity trackers and smartwatches are equipped with low-cost embedded sensors that can provide users with health statistics. In addition to wearable devices, Bluetooth low-energy sensors known as BLE beacons have gained traction among researchers in ambient intelligence domain. The low cost and durability of newer versions have made BLE beacons feasible gadgets to yield indoor localization data, an adjunct feature in human activity recognition. In the studies by Moatamed et al and the patent application by Ramezani et al, we introduced a generic framework (Sensing At-Risk Population) that draws on the classification of human movements using a 3-axial accelerometer and extracting indoor localization using BLE beacons, in concert.\nThe study aimed to examine the ability of combination of physical activity and indoor location features, extracted at baseline, on a cohort of 154 rehabilitation-dwelling patients to discriminate between subacute care patients who are re-admitted to the hospital versus the patients who are able to stay in a community setting.\nWe analyzed physical activity sensor features to assess activity time and intensity. We also analyzed activities with regard to indoor localization. Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare demographic variables and sensor feature variables in outcome groups. Random forests were used to build predictive models based on the most significant features.\nStanding time percentage (P<.001, d=1.51), laying down time percentage (P<.001, d=1.35), resident room energy intensity (P<.001, d=1.25), resident bed energy intensity (P<.001, d=1.23), and energy percentage of active state (P=.001, d=1.24) are the 5 most statistically significant features in distinguishing outcome groups at baseline. The energy intensity of the resident room (P<.001, d=1.25) was achieved by capturing indoor localization information. Random forests revealed that the energy intensity of the resident room, as a standalone attribute, is the most sensitive parameter in the identification of outcome groups (area under the curve=0.84).\nThis study demonstrates that a combination of indoor localization and physical activity tracking produces a series of features at baseline, a subset of which can better distinguish between at-risk patients that can gain independence versus the patients that are rehospitalized.", "With the development of computer-assisted surgery, preoperational design is detailed in software. However, it is still a challenge for surgeons to realize the surgical plan in the craniofacial surgery. Robot-assisted surgery has advantages of high accuracy and stability. It is suitable for the high-stress procedures like drilling, milling, and cutting. This study aims to verify the feasibility for automatic drilling without soft tissues in model test based on an industrial robot platform.This study chose the data from digital laboratory in Shanghai 9th People's Hospital. The mandibular was reconstructed in software and surgical plan was also designed. Then, the coordinate data was input to the robot's software and matrix conversion was calculated by 4 marked points. The trajectory generation was calculated by inverse kinematics for target coordinates and robot coordinates. The model was fixed and calibrated for automatic drilling. At last, the accuracy was calculated by optic scanning instrument.The installment and preparation cost 10 minutes, the drilling procedure cost 12 minutes. The outside position error was (1.71\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.16) mm, the inside position error was (1.37\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.28) mm, the orientation error was (3.04\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.02)\u00b0. Additionally, a total of 5 beagles were tested, with an accuracy error of (2.78\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.52)\u200amm. No postoperative complications occurred.This is the first study reported for robot-assisted automatic surgery in craniofacial surgery. The result shows it is possible to realize the automatic drilling procedure under the condition of no interference like soft tissues. With the development of artificial intelligence and machine vision, robot-assisted surgery may help surgeons to fulfill more automatic procedures for craniofacial surgery.", "Since its first publication in 1818, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus has transcended genres and cultures to become a foundational myth about science and technology across a multitude of media forms and adaptations. Following in the footsteps of the brilliant yet troubled Victor Frankenstein, professionals and practitioners have been debating the scientific ethics of creating life for decades, never before have powerful tools for doing so been so widely available. This paper investigates how engaging with the Frankenstein myth may help scientists gain a more accurate understanding of their own beliefs and opinions about the social and ethical aspects of their profession and their work. The paper presents findings from phenomenological interviews with twelve scientists working on biotechnology, robotics, or artificial intelligence projects. The results suggest that the Frankenstein myth, and the figure of Victor Frankenstein in particular, establishes norms for scientists about what is considered unethical and dangerous in scientific work. The Frankenstein myth both serves as a social and ethical reference for scientists and a mediator between scientists and the society. Grappling with the cultural ubiquity of the Frankenstein myth prepares scientists to face their ethical dilemmas and create a more transparent research agenda. Meanwhile, by focusing on the differences between real scientists and the imaginary figure of Victor Frankenstein, scientists may avoid being labeled as dangerous individuals, and could better conceptualize the potential societal and ethical perceptions and implications of their research.", "Gifted and talented students have different functioning in some components of executive functions, such as working memory. This meta-analysis examines the differences between students with high abilities and with average intelligence in working memory.\nA total of 17 articles with 33 different studies were analyzed. A random effects model was used, calculating the effect size with Hedges g. The moderating variables were analyzed using a meta-regression model for continuous variables and ANOVA for categorical variables.\nResults show an average effect size of g +=0.80 (95% CI: 0.621, 0.976) and high heterogeneity (Q(32)=196.966; <.001; I2 =83.754%). In the studies that measured verbal working memory, the effect size was g +=0.969 (95% CI: 0.697, 1.241) and heterogeneity I2 =83.416%. In those assessing visual working memory, g +=0.674 (95% CI: 0.443, 0.906) and the heterogeneity was 83.416%. The analysis of the moderating variables identified the way of measuring working memory as the only significant variable.\nThere is a significant effect in favor of gifted and talented students in both verbal and visual working memory, with significant influence of the procedure used to measure working memory.", "Sex chromosome trisomies (SCT) are among the most common chromosomal duplications in humans. Due to recent technological advances in non-invasive screening, SCT can already be detected during pregnancy. This calls for more knowledge about the development of (young) children with SCT. This review focused on neurocognitive functioning of children with SCT between 0 and 18 years, on domains of global intellectual functioning, language, executive functioning, and social cognition, in order to identify targets that could benefit from early treatment. Online databases were used to identify peer-reviewed scientific articles using specific search terms. In total 18 studies were included. When applicable, effect sizes were calculated to indicate clinical significance. Results of the reviewed studies show that although traditionally, the focus has been on language and intelligence (IQ) in this population, recent studies suggest that executive functioning and social cognition may also be significantly affected already in childhood. These findings suggest that neuropsychological screening of children diagnosed with SCT should be extended, to also include executive functioning and social cognition. Knowledge about these neurocognitive risks is important to improve clinical care and help identify targets for early support and intervention programs to accommodate for the needs of individuals with SCT.", "Prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma has dramatically improved over recent years because of the advent of antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1). However, the response rate is ~40% and baseline biomarkers for the outcome are yet to be identified. Here, we aimed to determine whether artificial intelligence might be useful in weighting the importance of baseline variables in predicting response to anti-PD1.\nThis is a retrospective study evaluating 173 patients receiving anti-PD1 for melanoma. Using an artificial neuronal network analysis, the importance of different variables was estimated and used in predicting response rate and overall survival.\nAfter a mean follow-up of 12.8 (\u00b111.9) months, disease control rate was 51%. Using artificial neuronal network, we observed that 3 factors predicted response to anti-PD1: neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (importance: 0.195), presence of \u22653 metastatic sites (importance: 0.156), and baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > upper limit of normal (importance: 0.154). Looking at connections between different covariates and overall survival, the most important variables influencing survival were: presence of \u22653 metastatic sites (importance: 0.202), age (importance: 0.189), NLR (importance: 0.164), site of primary melanoma (cutaneous vs. noncutaneous) (importance: 0.112), and LDH > upper limit of normal (importance: 0.108).\nNLR, presence of \u22653 metastatic sites, LDH levels, age, and site of primary melanoma are important baseline factors influencing response and survival. Further studies are warranted to estimate a model to drive the choice to administered anti-PD1 treatments in patients with melanoma.", "Purpose: The advances in artificial intelligence have started to reach a level where autonomous systems are becoming increasingly popular as a way to aid people in their everyday life. Such intelligent systems may especially be beneficially for people struggling to complete common everyday tasks, such as individuals with movement-related disabilities. The focus of this paper is hence to review recent work in using computer vision for semi-autonomous control of assistive robotic manipulators (ARMs). Methods: Four databases were searched using a block search, yielding 257 papers which were reduced to 14 papers after applying various filtering criteria. Each paper was reviewed with focus on the hardware used, the autonomous behaviour achieved using computer vision and the scheme for semi-autonomous control of the system. Each of the reviewed systems were also sought characterized by grading their level of autonomy on a pre-defined scale.Conclusions: A re-occurring issue in the reviewed systems was the inability to handle arbitrary objects. This makes the systems unlikely to perform well outside a controlled environment, such as a lab. This issue could be addressed by having the systems recognize good grasping points or primitive shapes instead of specific pre-defined objects. Most of the reviewed systems did also use a rather simple strategy for the semi-autonomous control, where they switch either between full manual control or full automatic control. An alternative could be a control scheme relying on adaptive blending which could provide a more seamless experience for the user.Implications for rehabilitationAssistive robotic manipulators (ARMs) have the potential to empower individuals with disabilities by enabling them to complete common everyday tasks. This potential can be further enhanced by making the ARM semi-autonomous in order to actively aid the user.The scheme used for the semi-autonomous control of the ARM is crucial as it may be a hindrance if done incorrectly. Especially the ability to customize the semi-autonomous behaviour of the ARM is found to be important.Further research is needed to make the final move from the lab to the homes of the users. Most of the reviewed systems suffer from a rather fixed scheme for the semi-autonomous control and an inability to handle arbitrary objects.", "Echocardiography is the foundation of noninvasive screening in patients exposed to potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. Guidelines are becoming more consistent in regard to screening and recommend an integrative approach between cardiology and oncology providers as well as optimal non-invasive imaging modalities. Optimal screening with the latest technology will place a significant cost and administrative burden on echocardiographic laboratories and cardiology clinics.\nThis review seeks to explore the latest studies regarding quality, cost, patient burden, and value related to implementing wide-spread screening for patients exposed to cardiotoxic chemotherapy. 3D and speckle tracking echocardiography are more reliable and can detect more subtle changes than traditional 2D volumes. Limited studies have revealed an uptake of optimal screening between 30 and 40%. Even fewer studies have evaluated the system-wide cost and value impact of screening in cardio-oncology or have evaluated patient-centered outcomes, such as cost and time burden. Finally, novel approaches, such as the use of point of care ultrasound with artificial intelligence guidance, may help alleviate these challenges. Screening patients at risk for cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction poses real-world challenges to our healthcare system. While modern echocardiographic techniques improve our ability to detect cardiac dysfunction, further research is needed to understand the challenges of wide-spread implementation.", "Conflict between response tendencies is ubiquitous in every day performance. Capabilities that resolve such conflicts are therefore mandatory for successful goal achievement. The present study investigates the potential of evaluative and motivational inner speech to help conflict resolution. In our study we assessed six tasks commonly used to measure conflict resolution capabilities and cognitive flexibility in 163 participants. Participants additionally answered questionnaires concerned with their habitual usage of inner speech such as silently rehearsing task instructions and evaluating performance. We found reduced conflict effects in tasks using symbolic, non-verbal stimuli for participants with higher self-reported use of evaluative and motivational inner speech. Overall, our findings suggest that silent self-talk and performance monitoring are beneficial for conflict resolution over and above constructs such as intelligence and working memory capacity that account for mean RT differences among participants.", "Viral diseases provide a major challenge to twenty-first century agriculture worldwide. Climate change and human population pressures are driving rapid alterations in agricultural practices and cropping systems that favor destructive viral disease outbreaks. Such outbreaks are strikingly apparent in subsistence agriculture in food-insecure regions. Agricultural globalization and international trade are spreading viruses and their vectors to new geographical regions with unexpected consequences for food production and natural ecosystems. Due to the varying epidemiological characteristics of diverent viral pathosystems, there is no one-size-fits-all approach toward mitigating negative viral disease impacts on diverse agroecological production systems. Advances in scientific understanding of virus pathosystems, rapid technological innovation, innovative communication strategies, and global scientific networks provide opportunities to build epidemiologic intelligence of virus threats to crop production and global food security. A paradigm shift toward deploying integrated, smart, and eco-friendly strategies is required to advance virus disease management in diverse agricultural cropping systems.", "This study uses a combined categorical-dimensional approach to depict a hierarchical framework for consciousness similar to, and contiguous with, factorial models of cognition (cf., intelligence). On the basis of the longstanding definition of time consciousness, the analysis employs a dimension of temporal extension, in the same manner that psychology has temporally organised memory (i.e., short-term, long-term, and long-lasting memories). By defining temporal extension in terms of the structure of time perception at short timescales (<100\u202fs), memory and time consciousness are proposed to fit along the same logarithmic dimension. This suggests that different forms of time consciousness (e.g., experience, wakefulness, and self-consciousness) are embedded within, or supported by, the ascending timescales of different modes of memory (i.e., short-term, long-term, etc.). A secondary dimension is also proposed to integrate higher-order forms of consciousness/emotion and memory/cognition. The resulting two-dimensional structure accords with existing theories of cognitive and emotional intelligence.", "The first concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) came into attention during 1920s and currently it is rapidly being integrated in our daily clinical practice. The use of AI has evolved from basic image-based analysis into complex decisions related to different surgical procedure. AI has been very widely used in the cardiology field, however the use of such machine-led decisions has been limited and explored at slower pace in surgical practice. The use of AI in cardiac surgery is still at its infancy but growing dramatically to reflect the changes in the clinical decision making process for better patient outcomes. The machine-led but human controlled algorithms will soon be taking over most of the decision making processes in cardiac surgery. This review article focuses on the practice of AI in aortic surgery and the future of such technology-led decision making pathways on patient outcomes, surgeon's learning skills and adaptability.", "At present times, healthcare systems are updated with advanced capabilities like machine learning (ML), data mining and artificial intelligence to offer human with more intelligent and expert healthcare services. This paper introduces an intelligent prediction and classification system for healthcare, namely Density based Feature Selection (DFS) with Ant Colony based Optimization (D-ACO) algorithm for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The proposed intelligent system eliminates irrelevant or redundant features by DFS in prior to the ACO based classifier construction. The proposed D-ACO framework three phases namely preprocessing, Feature Selection (FS) and classification. Furthermore, the D-ACO algorithm is tested using benchmark CKD dataset and the performance are investigated based on different evaluation factors. Comparing the D-ACO algorithm with existing methods, the presented intelligent system outperformed the other methodologies with a significant improvisation in classification accuracy using fewer features.", "Intelligence is a socially and scientifically interesting topic because of its prominence in human behavior, yet there is little clarity on how the neuroimaging and neurobiological correlates of intelligence differ between males and females, with most investigations limited to using either mass-univariate techniques or a single neuroimaging modality. Here we employed connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) to predict the intelligence quotient (IQ) scores for 166 males and 160 females separately, using resting-state functional connectivity, grey matter cortical thickness or both. The identified multimodal, IQ-predictive imaging features were then compared between genders. CPM showed high out-of-sample prediction accuracy (r\u2009>\u20090.34), and integrating both functional and structural features further improved prediction accuracy by capturing complementary information (r\u2009=\u20090.45). Male IQ demonstrated higher correlations with cortical thickness in the left inferior parietal lobule, and with functional connectivity in left parahippocampus and default mode network, regions previously implicated in spatial cognition and logical thinking. In contrast, female IQ was more correlated with cortical thickness in the right inferior parietal lobule, and with functional connectivity in putamen and cerebellar networks, regions previously implicated in verbal learning and item memory. Results suggest that the intelligence generation of males and females may rely on opposite cerebral lateralized key brain regions and distinct functional networks consistent with their respective superiority in cognitive domains. Promisingly, understanding the neural basis of gender differences underlying intelligence may potentially lead to optimized personal cognitive developmental programs and facilitate advancements in unbiased educational test design.", "First published in 2016, predictors of chronological and biological age developed using deep learning (DL) are rapidly gaining popularity in the aging research community. These deep aging clocks can be used in a broad range of applications in the pharmaceutical industry, spanning target identification, drug discovery, data economics, and synthetic patient data generation. We provide here a brief overview of recent advances in this important subset, or perhaps superset, of aging clocks that have been developed using artificial intelligence (AI).", "Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) researches have become essential in finding out the congenital relationship of structural deviations with quantitative traits, heritable diseases and physical responsiveness to different medicines. NBN is a protein coding gene (Breast Cancer); Nibrin is used to fix and rebuild the body from damages caused because of strand breaks (both singular and double) associated with protein nibrin. NBN gene was retrieved from dbSNP/NCBI database and investigated using computational SNP analysis tools. The encrypted region in SNPs (exonal SNPs) were analyzed using software tools, SIFT, Provean, Polyphen, INPS, SNAP and Phd-SNP. The 3'ends of SNPs in un-translated region were also investigated to determine the impact of binding. The association of NBN gene polymorphism leads to several diseases was studied. Four SNPs were predicted to be highly damaged in coding regions which are responsible for the diseases such as, Aplastic Anemia, Nijmegan breakage syndrome, Microsephaly normal intelligence, immune deficiency and hereditary cancer predisposing syndrome (clivar). The present study will be helpful in finding the suitable drugs in future for various diseases especially for breast cancer.", "This study was conducted to investigate the influence of emotional expressivity, emotional intelligence, affectivity, job autonomy, social support, and emotional labor on clinical nurses' individual well-being and to provide guidelines for interventions and strategies for its improvement.\nThe sample consisted of 207 nurses recruited from a general hospital in Korea. The participants completed a structured self-report questionnaire comprising measures of emotional expressivity, emotional intelligence, positive affectivity, negative affectivity, job autonomy, supervisor support, coworker support, deep acting, surface acting, emotional exhaustion, and job satisfaction. Data were analyzed using SPSS statistics 22.0 and AMOS 22.0.\nThe final model was a good fit for the data based on the model fit indices. In the path analysis, surface acting, negative affectivity, supervisor support, and coworker support had statistically significant effects on emotional exhaustion, explaining 29.0% of the variance. Deep acting, emotional exhaustion, positive affectivity, and emotional intelligence had statistically significant effects on job satisfaction, explaining 43.0% of the variance.\nEffective strategies to improve clinical nurses' individual well-being should focus on surface acting, deep acting, affectivity, social support, and emotional intelligence. The results of this study can be utilized as base data to manage emotional labor and improve clinical nurses' individual well-being.", "Parents want their children to be happy, educated, and successful, but are these goals related? People assume that success leads to happiness, but research on adults supports a reverse conceptualization: Happy people are more successful. Is happiness during childhood also linked to later success? Across the lifespan positive affect is linked with expanded cognitive abilities, learning, and resource building that can be adaptive and useful such that it leads to more success. Conversely, ongoing negative affect can reduce opportunities for growth and learning. Thus, happiness at any age may predict future success. Yet, no research has examined if positive and negative affect during infancy predicts childhood cognitive abilities and adult academics success. In a community sample, I hypothesized that higher infant positive affect (but not negative affect) would predict higher childhood cognitive abilities (i.e., IQ) and adult academic success (i.e., education attainment) in a 29-year study (n = 130). Positive affect, but not negative affect, during infancy (age 1.5), directly predicted higher childhood IQ (ages 6-8) and higher educational attainment (age 29), even after controlling for family socioeconomic status and infant intelligence. Childhood IQ partially explained the link between positive affect during infancy and adult educational attainment. This study advances understanding of how happiness during infancy (before formal education has begun) is linked to gold standard indicators of cognitive abilities and adult academic success. Parents, educators, and policymakers may want to place a higher value on early affective experiences when considering educational success.

However, it is not known whether the gray matter (GM) volume in the striatum is also sensitive in differentiating vulnerability from disease manifestation in HD families from a South-American region known to have high incidence of the disease. In addition, the association of enlarged brain perivascular spaces (PVS) with cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms of HD is unknown.\nWe have analyzed neuroimaging indicators of global atrophy, PVS burden, and GM tissue volume in the basal ganglia and thalami, in relation to behavioral, motor, and cognitive scores, in 15 HD patients with overt disease manifestation and 14 first-degree relatives not genetically tested, which represent a vulnerable group, from the region of Magdalena, Colombia.\nPoor fluid intelligence as per the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices was associated with global brain atrophy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and PVS burden (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.02) in HD patients, where the GM volume in all subcortical structures, with the exception of the right globus pallidus, was associated with motor or cognitive scores. Only the GM volume in the right putamen was associated with envy and MOCA scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008 and 0.015 respectively) in first-degree relatives.\nStriatal GM volume, global brain atrophy and PVS burden may serve as differential indicators of disease manifestation in HD. The Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices could be a cognitive test worth to consider in the differentiation of vulnerability versus overt disease in HD.", "Artificial-intelligence algorithms derive rules and patterns from large amounts of data to calculate the probabilities of various outcomes using new sets of similar data. In medicine, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied primarily to image-recognition diagnostic tasks and evaluating the probabilities of particular outcomes after treatment. However, the performance and limitations of AI in the automated detection and classification of fractures has not been examined comprehensively.\nIn this systematic review, we asked (1) What is the proportion of correctly detected or classified fractures and the area under the receiving operating characteristic (AUC) curve of AI fracture detection and classification models? (2) What is the performance of AI in this setting compared with the performance of human examiners?\nThe PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched from the start of each respective database until September 6, 2018, using terms related to \"fracture\", \"artificial intelligence\", and \"detection, prediction, or evaluation.\" Of 1221 identified studies, we retained 10 studies: eight studies involved fracture detection (ankle, hand, hip, spine, wrist, and ulna), one addressed fracture classification (diaphyseal femur), and one addressed both fracture detection and classification (proximal humerus). We registered the review before data collection (PROSPERO: CRD42018110167) and used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). We reported the range of the accuracy and AUC for the performance of the predicted fracture detection and/or classification task. An AUC of 1.0 would indicate perfect prediction, whereas 0.5 would indicate a prediction is no better than a flip-of-a-coin. We conducted quality assessment using a seven-item checklist based on a modified methodologic index for nonrandomized studies instrument (MINORS).\nFor fracture detection, the AUC in five studies reflected near perfect prediction (range, 0.95-1.0), and the accuracy in seven studies ranged from 83% to 98%. For fracture classification, the AUC was 0.94 in one study, and the accuracy in two studies ranged from 77% to 90%. In two studies AI outperformed human examiners for detecting and classifying hip and proximal humerus fractures, and one study showed equivalent performance for detecting wrist, hand and ankle fractures.\nPreliminary experience with fracture detection and classification using AI shows promising performance. AI may enhance processing and communicating probabilistic tasks in medicine, including orthopaedic surgery. At present, inadequate reference standard assignments to train and test AI is the biggest hurdle before integration into clinical workflow. The next step will be to apply AI to more challenging diagnostic and therapeutic scenarios when there is absence of certitude. Future studies should also seek to address legal regulation and better determine feasibility of implementation in clinical practice.\nLevel II, diagnostic study.", "Traditional methods used to disseminate educational resources to front-line healthcare staff have several limitations. Social media may increase the visibility of these resources among targeted groups and communities. Our project aimed to disseminate key clinical messages from the National Tracheostomy Safety Project to those caring for patients with tracheostomies or laryngectomies. We commissioned an external media company to design educational material and devise a marketing strategy. We developed videos to communicate recommendations from the safety project and used Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn to deliver these to our target users. We recorded 629,270 impressions over a paid 12-week campaign. Our YouTube channel registered more than a five-fold increase in views and watch time during the campaign as compared with the previous year. Around two-thirds of views across all platforms were from peer-to-peer sharing. We spent \u00a34140 on social media advertising, with each view and click costing \u00a30.02 and \u00a30.67, respectively. This intelligence-led approach using social media is an effective and efficient method to disseminate knowledge on the principles of safe tracheostomy care to front-line clinical staff. Similar strategies may be effective for other patient safety topics, especially when targeting groups that do not use medical journals or other traditional means of dissemination.", "In student-regulated instruction, guiding one's study effectively and efficiently is crucial for successful learning. Yet, significant variability exists in how effectively learners regulate their own study. Here, we explored whether and how beliefs about the nature of intelligence affect learners' metacognitive control and ultimately the efficacy of their study choices. We manipulated learners' theories of intelligence across two experiments. Learners then studied a list of words for a later memory test, chose half of the words to restudy, and restudied their chosen items. Learners who were persuaded to believe intelligence was malleable chose to restudy more poorly learned items and ultimately learned more than learners who were persuaded to believe intelligence was fixed. Learners' underlying beliefs about the nature of intelligence may affect learners' goals and ultimately their metacognitive control.

The findings mostly support the continued use of both SDQ versions in screening for psychosocial problems as (a) exploratory structural equation analyses partially supported the grouping of items into five scales; (b) investigation of associations between scales of the SDQ and the Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self-Report, and Intelligence Development Scales-2 provided evidence for the SDQ versions' convergent and divergent validity; and (c) receiver operating characteristics curves yielded evidence for both SDQ versions' criterion validity by showing that these questionnaires can be used to screen for psychosocial problems, except for the adolescent-reported version for males. Regardless of the adolescent's gender, the receiver operating characteristics curves showed both SDQ versions to be useful for screening for three specific types of problems: anxiety/mood disorder, conduct/oppositional deviant disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Additionally, parent-rated SDQ scores were found to be useful for screening for autism spectrum disorder.", "Recent years have been marked by important developments in artificial intelligence (AI). These developments have highlighted serious limitations in human rationality and shown that computers can be highly creative. There are also important positive outcomes for psychologists studying creativity. It is now possible to design entirely new classes of experiments that are more promising than the simple tasks typically used for studying creativity in psychology. In addition, given the current and future AI algorithms for developing new data structures and programs, novel theories of creativity are on the horizon. Thus, AI opens up entire new avenues for studying human creativity in psychology.", "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) promises to have a transformational impact on quality in medicine, including in radiology. However, experience has shown that quality tools alone are often not sufficient to bring about consistent excellent performance. Specifically, rather than assuming outcome targets are consistently met, in quality control, managers assume that wide variation is likely present unless proven otherwise with objective performance data. In this article, we discuss what we consider to be the eight essential elements required to achieve comprehensive process control, necessary to deliver consistent quality in radiology: a process control framework, performance measures, performance standards and targets, monitoring applications, prediction models, optimization models, feedback mechanisms, and accountability mechanisms. We consider these elements to be universally applicable, including in the application of AI-based models. We also discuss how the lack of specific elements of a quality control program can hinder widespread quality control efforts. We illustrate the concept using the example of a CT radiation dose optimization and process control program previously developed by one of the authors and provide several examples of how AI-based tools might be used for quality control in radiology.", "This study sought to utilise machine learning methods in artificial intelligence to select the most relevant variables in classifying the presence and absence of root caries and to evaluate the model performance.\nDental caries is one of the most prevalent oral health problems. Artificial intelligence can be used to develop models for identification of root caries risk and to gain valuable insights, but it has not been applied in dentistry. Accurately identifying root caries may guide treatment decisions, leading to better oral health outcomes.\nData were obtained from the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and were randomly divided into training and test sets. Several supervised machine learning methods were applied to construct a tool that was capable of classifying variables into the presence and absence of root caries. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating curve were computed.\nOf the machine learning algorithms developed, support vector machine demonstrated the best performance with an accuracy of 97.1%, precision of 95.1%, sensitivity of 99.6% and specificity of 94.3% for identifying root caries. The area under the curve was 0.997. Age was the feature most strongly associated with root caries.\nThe machine learning algorithms developed in this study perform well and allow for clinical implementation and utilisation by dental and nondental professionals. Clinicians are encouraged to adopt the algorithms from this study for early intervention and treatment of root caries for the ageing population of the United States, and for attaining precision dental medicine.", "Over the past decade, scientific discovery games (SDGs) have emerged as a viable approach for biomedical research, engaging hundreds of thousands of volunteer players and resulting in numerous scientific publications. After describing the origins of this novel research approach, we review the scientific output of SDGs across molecular modeling, sequence alignment, neuroscience, pathology, cellular biology, genomics, and human cognition. We find compelling results and technical innovations arising in problem-oriented games such as Foldit and Eterna and in data-oriented games such as EyeWire and Project Discovery. We discuss emergent properties of player communities shared across different projects, including the diversity of communities and the extraordinary contributions of some volunteers, such as paper writing. Finally, we highlight connections to artificial intelligence, biological cloud laboratories, new game genres, science education, and open science that may drive the next generation of SDGs.", "We examined the role of personality and health as time-invariant and time-varying predictors of changes in different cognitive domains based on data from the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on Adult Development. Our sample consisted of 500 individuals born between 1930 and 1932 (baseline age: M = 62.87 years, SD = 0.89 years) who were assessed up to 4 times over an interval of up to 20 years. Cognitive abilities were measured by multiple well-established tests representing crystallized intelligence, fluid intelligence, and information processing speed. Because of poor psychometric properties of openness in our sample, only 4 of the Big Five personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) were used. Based on in-depth medical examinations, physicians rated study participants' health. When considered as time-invariant predictors, lower baseline neuroticism and extraversion scores were associated with better baseline performance on the crystallized and fluid ability tests. Higher initial extraversion was associated with less steep decline in information processing speed. Worse baseline physician health was associated with lower baseline scores on fluid abilities and information processing speed. Moreover, worse initial health was associated with steeper decline in crystallized and fluid abilities. From a time-varying perspective, crystallized abilities were lower on measurement occasions when individuals revealed poorer health. Our findings suggest that late-life cognitive abilities are differentially related with personality and health. Overall, personality characteristics are associated with late-life cognitive abilities, but less so from a time-varying perspective. They also seem to be of limited importance for the prediction of long-term change in cognitive abilities.

Because of its favorable efficacy, tolerability, and safety profile, levetiracetam (LEV) monotherapy is often administered in these patients. Long-term effects of LEV therapy and its influence on cognitive functions remain controversial.\nThis evaluated the changes in the cognitive profile of children with BECTS treated with LEV monotherapy for 2\u202fyears, compared with a control group of children with specific learning disabilities.\nOur patient cohort included 20 children aged 8-14\u202fyears diagnosed as having BECTS and administered LEV monotherapy and 10 age/sex-matched controls with specific learning disabilities. All participants underwent a standardized test for assessing cognitive profile (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition [WISC-IV]) before drug therapy and after 2\u202fyears of treatment. Average LEV blood level and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were periodically monitored. Several factors such as age, sex, response to therapy, and EEG pattern changes were considered. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test for paired and independent samples. p\u202f<\u202f0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nChildren administered LEV for 24\u202fmonths showed a mild but statistically significant improvement in overall cognitive abilities. Verbal skills, visual-perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed showed slight but significant improvement. In the control group, cognitive profile remained substantially unchanged at 2-year follow-up.\nNot only do our data suggest a nonworsening of the cognitive profile in BECTS with LEV but, on the contrary, cognitive scores also improved over time, unlike the control group.", "In human-robot interaction (HRI), classification is one of the most important problems, and it is essential particularly when the robot recognizes the surroundings and chooses a reaction based on a certain situation. Each interaction is different since new people appear or the environment changes, and the robot should be able to adapt to different situations during a brief interaction. Thus, it is imperative that the classification is performed incrementally in real time. In this sense, we propose an online incremental classification resonance network (OICRN) that enables incremental class learning in multi-class classification with high performance online. In OICRN, a scale-preserving projection process is introduced to use the raw input vectors online without a normalization process in advance. The integrated network of the convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and the OICRN for classification is applied to a robotic system that learns human identities through HRIs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our network, experiments are carried out on benchmark data sets and on a humanoid robot, Mybot, developed in the Robot Intelligence Technology Laboratory, KAIST.", "The recent advances in the field of machine learning have raised expectations that computer-aided diagnosis will become the standard for the diagnosis of melanoma.\nTo critically review the current literature and compare the diagnostic accuracy of computer-aided diagnosis with that of human experts.\nThe MEDLINE, arXiv, and PubMed Central databases were searched to identify eligible studies published between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2018.\nStudies that reported on the accuracy of automated systems for melanoma were selected. Search terms included melanoma, diagnosis, detection, computer aided, and artificial intelligence.\nEvaluation of the risk of bias was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool, and quality assessment was based on predefined criteria. Data were analyzed from February 1 to March 10, 2019.\nSummary estimates of sensitivity and specificity and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were the primary outcomes.\nThe literature search yielded 1694 potentially eligible studies, of which 132 were included and 70 offered sufficient information for a quantitative analysis. Most studies came from the field of computer science. Prospective clinical studies were rare. Combining the results for automated systems gave a melanoma sensitivity of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.80) and a specificity of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.79-0.88). Sensitivity was lower in studies that used independent test sets than in those that did not (0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.69 vs 0.82; 95% CI, 0.77-0.86; P\u2009<\u2009.001); however, the specificity was similar (0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.91 vs 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80-0.88; P\u2009=\u2009.67). In comparison with dermatologists' diagnosis, computer-aided diagnosis showed similar sensitivities and a 10 percentage points lower specificity, but the difference was not statistically significant. Studies were heterogeneous and substantial risk of bias was found in all but 4 of the 70 studies included in the quantitative analysis.\nAlthough the accuracy of computer-aided diagnosis for melanoma detection is comparable to that of experts, the real-world applicability of these systems is unknown and potentially limited owing to overfitting and the risk of bias of the studies at hand.", "Artificial intelligence methods for the classification of melanoma have been studied extensively. However, few studies compare these methods under the same standards.\nTo seek the best artificial intelligence method for diagnosis of melanoma.\nThe contrast test used 2200 dermoscopic images. Image segmentations, feature extractions, and classifications were performed in sequence for evaluation of traditional machine learning algorithms. The recent popular convolutional neural network frameworks were used for transfer learning training classification.\nThe region growing algorithm has the best segmentation performance, with an intersection over union of 70.06% and a false-positive rate of 17.67%. Classification performance was better with logistic regression, with a sensitivity of 76.36% and a specificity of 87.04%. The Inception V3 model (Google, Mountain View, CA) worked best in deep learning algorithms: the accuracy was 93.74%, the sensitivity was 94.36%, and the specificity was 85.64%.\nThere was no division in the severity of melanoma samples used in this experiment. The data set was relatively small for deep learning.\nThe performance of traditional machine learning is satisfactory for the small data set of melanoma dermoscopic images, and the potential for deep learning in the future big data era is enormous.", "Techniques from the field of artificial intelligence, and more specifically machine (deep) learning methods, have been core components of most recent developments in the field of medical imaging. They are already being exploited or are being considered to tackle most tasks, including image reconstruction, processing (denoising, segmentation), analysis and predictive modelling. In this review we introduce and define these key concepts and discuss how the techniques from this field can be applied to nuclear medicine imaging applications with a particular focus on radio(geno)mics.", "Eating disorders (ED) and schizophrenia are frequently comorbid and schizophrenia shares genetic susceptibility with anorexia. Many factors associated with schizophrenia can disrupt eating, but ED can present years before schizophrenia. If premorbid ED distinguishes a particular subtype of schizophrenia, then phenotypic features may differ between schizophrenia cases with and without premorbid ED.\nThis secondary analysis used data from an inpatient schizophrenia research study that comprehensively assessed life course psychiatric disorders (DIGS interview), intelligence (WAIS), global assessments of function (GAF) and assessed symptoms during medication-free and fixed dose neuroleptic phases (PANSS).\nPremorbid ED was identified in 27 of the 288 schizophrenia cases (9.4%). This group had more females than the group without premorbid ED (74.1% vs. 30%); premorbid ED was 5-fold more common in female than male cases (\u03c72 (17.9, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Only the premorbid ED group had gustatory hallucinations. They also demonstrated significantly more severe psychotic and disorganization symptoms during medication-free and fixed dose treatment phases, despite similar negative symptoms and GAF scores, as other cases. The premorbid ED group had significantly better cognition overall, but relatively lower nonverbal than verbal intelligence.\nPremorbid ED may define a specific subtype of schizophrenia that is common in females. Their more severe psychotic symptoms and better IQ, despite similarly impaired function and negative symptoms as other cases, suggests a distinct pathophysiology. Premorbid ED should be considered in evaluating risk states for schizophrenia, and as a relevant phenotype for treatment resistant schizophrenia.", "In past decades, there have been great achievements on theoretical prediction and experimental fabrication of two-dimensional transition metal carbides. In this work, we report a hitherto unknown atomic-thin planar-structured transition metal carbide sheet denoted as MC6 (M = Cu, Ag, Au) via a structure-swarm intelligence algorithm. The proposed 2D crystals are both statically and dynamically stable, and could maintain their structure integrity at temperatures up to 1500 K. The calculated specific capacities of lithium-ion batteries employing such materials reach 1188 mA h g-1, which is 26.38% higher than previously reported highest MXene material with Mn+1Xn atomic configuration. Our results present the potential application of MC6 in Li-ion batteries.", "Driven by the rapid development of big data and processing power, artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) applications are poised to expand orthopedic surgery frontiers. Lower extremity arthroplasty is uniquely positioned to most dramatically benefit from ML applications given its central role in alternative payment models and the value equation.\nIn this report, we discuss the origins and model specifics behind machine learning, consider its progression into healthcare, and present some of its most recent advances and applications in arthroplasty.\nA narrative review of artificial intelligence and ML developments is summarized with specific applications to lower extremity arthroplasty, with specific lessons learned from osteoarthritis gait models, joint-specific imaging analysis, and value-based payment models.\nThe advancement and employment of ML provides an opportunity to provide data-driven, high performance medicine that can rapidly improve the science, economics, and delivery of lower extremity arthroplasty.", "Our objective was to explore the relationship between mother smoking during pregnancy and physiological anxiety of children with Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Cognitive profile was evaluated by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, physiological anxiety by Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale. Mother's smoking was evaluated by the Fagerstr\u00f6m test for nicotine dependence. Ninety-seven children with Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder combined type, 70 inattentive, and 48 hyperactive-impulsive, and 130 controls were studied. We found a higher frequency of high smoking dependence in mothers of children with Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder-combined type, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-hyperactive type in the Fagerstr\u00f6m test; and a significant correlation between physiological anxiety in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-combined type, with high and moderate maternal smoking level during pregnancy. In conclusion, data suggests, with caution a brain alteration of infants, induced by nicotine exposure during pregnancy in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-combined type, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-hyperactive type.", "In families, mothers and fathers may hold the same or different levels of theories of intelligence. This congruence and discrepancy may influence parental involvement in children's education. The current study examined how both parents' theories of intelligence and the direction and degree of the discrepancy of parents' intelligence theories influence maternal and paternal involvement separately. We measured 1,694 matched pairs of parents' theories of intelligence and educational involvement, and examined the relationships using linear regressions and polynomial regressions with response surface analysis. The results showed that (1) the mother's intelligence theory positively related to both paternal involvement and maternal involvement, but the father's intelligence theory only positively related to paternal involvement; (2) when the parents' theories of intelligence reached congruence, the parents' theories of intelligence are positively related to both maternal and paternal involvement; (3) when the parents' theories of intelligence have discrepancy, the maternal involvement is higher while the mother's intelligence theory's level is more incremental than father's; and (4) when the parents' theories of intelligence have discrepancy, more discrepancy of parents' theories of intelligence is related to more paternal involvement. This study revealed the significance of mother's role in education, highlighted the importance of parents' congruence and discrepancies in beliefs, examined how parents' beliefs impact their own behavior and their couple's behavior.", "Genetic predisposition might affect neurodevelopmental outcomes of prenatal methylmercury exposure. We examined suspected heterogeneities for modification of exposure-related neurodevelopment in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (1991-2000), Bristol, United Kingdom. A subgroup (n = 1,127 from a pilot study and 1,045 from the present study) was identified based on the availability of the mercury concentration of cord tissue as a measure of prenatal methylmercury exposure, data on 247 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. Log10-transformed mercury concentration was positively associated with IQ, but adjustment for confounding cofactors attenuated this association. A finding of enhanced interaction with methylmercury was replicated in this study for the minor allele of rs1042838 (progesterone receptor) (\u03b2 = -11.8, 95% confidence interval: -23.0, -0.6; P for interaction = 0.004) and weakly for rs662 (paraoxonase 1) (\u03b2 = -3.6, 95% confidence interval: -11.4, 4.3; P = 0.117). In the joint sample, new interacting single-nucleotide polymorphisms were discovered in relation to superoxide dismutase 2, ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1, and metallothionein 1M genes. While the low-level prenatal exposure to methylmercury was not associated with child cognition, progesterone receptor rs1042838 minor alleles revealed a negative association of mercury exposure with IQ.", "This study aimed to assess the extent of burnout in Romanian and Moldavian academic physicians and to determine the predictive value of emotional intelligence (EI), coping strategies, work motivation (WM), perceived organizational support (POS), and the socio-demographic characteristics of burnout. Two hundred physicians (40% men, 60% women, mean age = 43.02, SD = 9.91) participated in the study. They were administered the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey, Brief COPE Scale, Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale, Schutte's Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test, and Perceived Organizational Support Scale. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess the significance of intercountry differences, while hierarchical regressions were performed to investigate the predictive value of the independent variables on burnout. Moldavian participants had significantly lower scores in burnout and amotivation (p < 0.001) and higher scores in EI, POS, and WM (p < 0.001). The main burnout predictors were amotivation (\u03b2 = 0.388, p < 0.001) and low POS (\u03b2 = -0.313, p< 0.001) in Moldavian respondents, and WM (intrinsic: \u03b2 = -0.620, p < 0.001; extrinsic: \u03b2 = 0.406, p < 0.001) in Romanian participants. Moldavian respondents displayed better adjustment to academic stress. The distribution of burnout predictors suggests better sensitivity of respondents to organizational interventions in Moldova and to individual therapy in Romania. This data could serve to better tailor Public Health interventions addressing burnout in the academic environment.", "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy with unique clinical biological profiles such as associated Epstein-Barr virus infection and high radiosensitivity. Radiotherapy has long been recognized as the mainstay for the treatment of NPC. However, the further efficacy brought by radical radiotherapy has reached the bottleneck in advanced patients, who are prone to develop recurrence and distant metastasis after treatment. The application of photon therapy makes it possible for radiation dose escalation in refractory cases and may provide second chance for recurrent patients with less unrecoverable tissue damage. The concept of adaptive radiotherapy is put forward in consideration of target volume shrinkage during treatment. The replanning procedure offers better protection for the organ at risk. However, the best timing and candidates for adaptive radiotherapy is still under debate. The current tendency of artificial intelligence in NPC mainly focuses on image recognition, auto-segmentation and dose prediction. Although artificial intelligence is still in developmental stage, the future of it is promising.To further improve the efficacy of NPC, multimodality treatment is encouraged. In-depth studies on genetic and epigenetic variations help to explain the great heterogeneity among patients, and could further be applied to precise screening and prediction, personalized radiotherapy and the evolution of targeted drugs. Given the clinical benefit of immunotherapy in other cancers, the application of immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitor, in NPC is also of great potential. Results from ongoing clinical trials combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy in NPC are expected.", "Mindsets, or beliefs about the malleability of self-attributes such as intelligence and personality, have been linked to a wide range of outcomes in educational and social psychology. There has been recent interest in exploring this construct in clinical psychological contexts. To that end, research has shown that the fixed mindset of anxiety-the belief that anxiety is fixed and unchangeable-is related to a variety of psychological distress symptoms, emotion regulation strategies, and treatment preferences. One outstanding question is whether the fixed mindset of anxiety predicts future psychological symptoms. To address this question, the current longitudinal study assessed weekly distress and anxiety mindset across 5 weeks. We found that fixed mindset of anxiety is predictive of future weekly distress, even after controlling for the previous week's distress, sex, socioeconomic status, baseline depression symptoms, and presence of psychiatric diagnosis. These findings add evidence to an emerging conceptual framework in which the fixed mindset of anxiety represents an important risk factor for the onset of future psychological problems.", "To study the effects of prenatal cold stress on the behavior and mood of offspring in pregnant rats.\nSix SPF-class Wister pregnant rats were randomly divided into normal temperature control group and cold stress group with 3 rats in each group. The pregnant female rats in the normal temperature control group were kept in the environment of (22 \u00b12)\u2103, and the pregnant female rats in the cold stress group were placed in the artificial intelligence climate chamber at(4 \u00b10.1)\u2103 for 7 days before the birth, and the young rats were divided into normal temperature after the young rats were born. After the young rats were born, they were divided into normal temperature control group of male rats (MR, 22), normal temperature control group of mother rats (FR, 15), cold stress group of male rats (MC, 15), and cold stress group of female rats (FC, 15) .In the fourth generation of the offspring, the open field experiment and the elevated cross maze test were carried out.\nIn the open field experiment, there was no significant difference in spontaneous activity and exploration behavior between the normal temperature control group and the cold stress group (P\uff1e0.05). In the elevated plus maze experiment, the retention time of the open arms, the number of open arms and the distance of the male and female rats in the cold stress group were significantly higher than those in the normal temperature control group (P\uff1c0.05).\nPrenatal maternal cold stress has no significant effect on spontaneous activity, exploration behavior and activity level of offspring, but the offspring have obvious abnormal behaviors with reduced anxiety behavior.", "This study investigated the auditory sensory-perceptual level of specific learning disorder (SLD) and explored relationships among neuropsychological assessments for SLD, auditory processing, and short and long latencies of auditory event-related potentials (ERPs).\nFifteen children (7-14\u202fyears old) comprised the control group; 34 children comprised the SLD group. Audiologic assessments included tone audiometry, acoustic immittance measurements, acoustic reflex, central auditory processing, brainstem evoked response audiometry, and long latency potentials (P3 and N2). Children's intelligence levels were assessed with 2 intelligence batteries, 1 verbal and 1 non-verbal, as well as with visuomotor skills.\nMultiple regression showed a significant interaction effect of APE tests and P3/N2 over Wechsler Scale performance in freedom of distractibility indexes and multiple subtests. Errors in the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test were predicted by lower parental education, lower performance in APE tests: dichotic digits and pediatric/synthetic sentence identification-ipsilateral, and longer P3/N2 latencies, particularly regarding integration and rotation distortions.\nChildren with altered auditory processing exhibit a specific cognitive profile, including lower verbal and spatial reasoning performance, that is sensitive to parental education level.\nChildren with SLD should undergo a complete multimodal examination to identify their specific difficulties and needs.", "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women, with more than 1,300,000 cases and 450,000 deaths each year worldwide. In this context, recent studies showed that early breast cancer detection, along with suitable treatment, could significantly reduce breast cancer death rates in the long term. X-ray mammography is still the instrument of choice in breast cancer screening. In this context, the false-positive and false-negative rates commonly achieved by radiologists are extremely arduous to estimate and control although some authors have estimated figures of up to 20% of total diagnoses or more. The introduction of novel artificial intelligence (AI) technologies applied to the diagnosis and, possibly, prognosis of breast cancer could revolutionize the current status of the management of the breast cancer patient by assisting the radiologist in clinical image interpretation. Lately, a breakthrough in the AI field has been brought about by the introduction of deep learning techniques in general and of convolutional neural networks in particular. Such techniques require no a priori feature space definition from the operator and are able to achieve classification performances which can even surpass human experts. In this paper, we design and validate an ad hoc CNN architecture specialized in breast lesion classification from imaging data only. We explore a total of 260 model architectures in a train-validation-test split in order to propose a model selection criterion which can pose the emphasis on reducing false negatives while still retaining acceptable accuracy. We achieve an area under the receiver operatic characteristics curve of 0.785 (accuracy 71.19%) on the test set, demonstrating how an ad hoc random initialization architecture can and should be fine tuned to a specific problem, especially in biomedical applications.", "Objective: To carry out and investigate the effectiveness of an emotional intelligence (EI) training based on the EI ability model, using videogames as experience-based learning tools to increase EI abilities in adolescents. Materials and Methods: A pre-/post-test/follow-up quasi-experimental design was used with an experimental and a control group (121 adolescents, 15.7% boys, mean age of 14.1 years). The training called \"EmotivaMente\" consisted of eight sessions lasting 1.5 hours each, conducted with six first-year classes of two Italian senior high schools. Data on emotional competences were collected at baseline, at the end of the training and 3 months later. Data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Students who participated in the EI training reported an improvement in the evaluation and expression of emotions in relation to the self (own emotions) compared with the control group, immediately after the training, but this difference did not persist at the follow-up (3 months later). Furthermore, EmotivaMente found an increase in the use of cognitive revaluation as a strategy of emotion regulation in the experimental group over time. Conclusions: EmotivaMente helped adolescents to improve emotional skills. Results confirmed that videogames can be useful to promote EI in adolescents at school, if integrated with a guided and assisted framework. Implication of the findings and recommendations for future research are made.", "Artur Yakimovich works in the field of computational virology and applies machine learning algorithms to study host-pathogen interactions.

However, linking genotype to phenotype remains a huge challenge and is hampering the optimal application of high-throughput genomics and phenomics to advanced breeding. Critical to success is the need to assimilate large amounts of data into biologically meaningful interpretations. Here, we present the current state of genomics and field phenomics, explore emerging approaches and challenges for multiomics big data integration by means of next-generation (Next-Gen) artificial intelligence (AI), and propose a workable path to improvement.", "A non-fatal suicide attempt is a strong predictor of suicide. This study aimed to examine personal characteristics and psychiatric diagnoses among Druze soldiers who attempted suicide during their military service.\nThe research group (n\u202f=\u202f180) included all Druze soldiers who had attempted suicide between the years 2008-2012 (This number encompassed 18.4% of all suicide attempts in the IDF during those years). Three control groups were examined: Jewish soldiers who had attempted suicide (n\u202f=\u202f155), and two additional groups comprising Druze and Jewish combat soldiers who had not attempted suicide (n\u202f=\u202f5,255 and n\u202f=\u202f205,819, respectively).\nWhile Druze soldiers were diagnosed with psychiatric conditions less frequently than their Jewish counterparts, the more prolonged time to diagnosis among Druze may account for increased severity at time of diagnosis, thus increasing the risk of suicide attempt. A multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of a suicide attempt among Druze soldiers were much higher than among Jewish soldiers (OR 20.53; p < .001). In addition, it was found that average and high socioeconomic levels, strong Hebrew language skills, and high intelligence levels were protective factors against attempted suicide (p < .001, R2\u202f=\u202f0.217).\nThe three control groups were samples, while the research group (Druze attempters) consisted of all instances of attempted suicide during the study period. Comparing only samples would have offered less statistical power; therefore, using all the records in the research group improved accuracy.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been present in some guise within the field of radiology for over 50 years. The first studies investigating computer-aided diagnosis in thoracic radiology date back to the 1960s, and in the subsequent years, the main application of these techniques has been the detection and classification of pulmonary nodules. In addition, there have been other less intensely researched applications, such as the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the detection of pulmonary emboli. Despite extensive literature on the use of convolutional neural networks in thoracic imaging over the last few decades, we are yet to see these systems in use in clinical practice. The article reviews current state-of-the-art applications of AI and in detection, classification, and follow-up of pulmonary nodules and how deep-learning techniques might influence these going forward. Finally, we postulate the impact of these advancements on the role of radiologists and the importance of radiologists in the development and evaluation of these techniques.", "Agent-based modeling is a rule-based, discrete-event, and spatially explicit computational modeling method that employs computational objects that instantiate the rules and interactions among the individual components (\"agents\") of system. Agent-based modeling is well suited to translating into a computational model the knowledge generated from basic science research, particularly with respect to translating across scales the mechanisms of cellular behavior into aggregated cell population dynamics manifesting at the tissue and organ level. This capacity has made agent-based modeling an integral method in translational systems biology (TSB), an approach that uses multiscale dynamic computational modeling to explicitly represent disease processes in a clinically relevant fashion. The initial work in the early 2000s using agent-based models (ABMs) in TSB focused on examining acute inflammation and its intersection with wound healing; the decade since has seen vast growth in both the application of agent-based modeling to a wide array of disease processes as well as methodological advancements in the use and analysis of ABM. This report presents an update on an earlier review of ABMs in TSB and presents examples of exciting progress in the modeling of various organs and diseases that involve inflammation. This review also describes developments that integrate the use of ABMs with cutting-edge technologies such as high-performance computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, with a view toward the future integration of these methodologies.

Its multiple cascades could realize diversified ion transport behaviors and information processing functions. Different cascade modes of channel units will affect the response current properties of multichannel systems. Inspired by independent and synergistic effects in semiconductor transistors, artificial conical nanoporous bichannel systems were investigated in separation and stacking cascade modes to discuss their different ion transport behaviors. The dynamic resistance fitting method was adopted to discuss the properties of each circuit components in the bichannel system for analyzing the circuit properties in different cascade modes. In the stacking mode, electric field interactions at the heterojunctions between channel units dominated the ionic transport properties, and response current of the bichannel system was influenced by the channel unit cascade sequence. In the separation mode, channel units transport ions independently, and the cascade sequence had little effect on response current properties of the system. These promising results provide a new strategy to design and build a series of artificial composite nanochannels with multifunction and intelligence.", "Lymphedema (LE) has been called the forgotten vascular disease, given such scant knowledge about LE-associated comorbidities or causes. Such knowledge of the comorbidities and treatment of LE may assist in diagnostic decisions and health care planning.\nTo determine the proportion of LE patients with various LE-associated comorbidities as well as the rate of associated treatment, deidentified Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant commercial administrative claims from the Blue Health Intelligence (BHI) research database (165 million Blue Cross Blue Shield members) were queried. We analyzed a BHI study sample of 26,902 patients with LE who had been enrolled with continuous medical benefits for 12\u00a0months before and after the index date for the complete years 2012 through 2016. Patients were first identified by comorbidity and then grouped into those receiving no treatment for LE and those receiving any treatment for LE. Any treatment was defined as receiving manual lymphatic drainage, physical therapy, compression garments, or a pneumatic compression device. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of LE patients comorbid with various known LE-associated conditions and the treatment rates of LE patients with each comorbidity.\nAmong the 84,579,269 BHI patients enrolled during the study window, 81,366 patients were identified with LE. From this LE group, our study focused on the 26,902 patients who were enrolled with continuous medical and pharmacy benefits for 12\u00a0months before and after the index date. Among these 26,902 LE patients, breast cancer was the most frequent comorbidity with LE (32.1%), and these patients almost universally received any treatment (94.2%); other cancer types, such as melanoma (2.1%) and prostate cancer (0.7%), were less frequent and received any treatment less often, 75% and 82% of the time, respectively. Venous leg ulcer was the most common non-cancer-linked comorbidity for LE (9.6%), but only 81.7% of venous leg ulcer patients received any treatment for LE.\nTo our knowledge, this is the largest study to date detailing the comorbidities associated with LE and LE treatment rates within each. Our findings suggest that a sizable proportion of cancer-related LE patients do not receive appropriate treatment. Furthermore, this study highlights the role of advanced venous disease as an LE comorbidity that is frequently untreated and its associated gap in treatment.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) has attracted increasing attention in organizational psychology. The aim of this study was to test the applicability of two performance-based emotional intelligence tests developed in western countries, namely, the brief versions of the Situational Test of Emotional Understanding (STEU-B) and the Situational Test of Emotional Management (STEM-B), in a sample of 904 Chinese employees. Specifically, item response theory (IRT) analyses were conducted. The item parameters along with the item and test information functions of the Chinese versions of the STEU-B and STEM-B were estimated. Moreover, the associations between the STEU-B and STEM-B scores and several work-related variables were examined. The results showed that the STEU-B and STEM-B had acceptable internal consistencies, and similar mean proportions of correct responses, item parameters, item information functions, and test information functions in China, as reported in previous studies. Furthermore, the scores were found to be related to the employees' psychological strain, job-related affect, job satisfaction, and supervisor-rated job performance in a theoretically hypothesized manner. These findings suggested that the STEU-B and STEM-B might be useful measurements in future EI studies in the Chinese organizational context.", "Inventions from the field of health research are mostly protected by patents. The main objective of this study is to identify the research and development trends of dental innovations for children, with a special focus on the inventions for dental caries in primary teeth and early childhood caries (ECC) by performing a patent landscape analysis on a global scale with special attention to the role of European countries in patenting activities. A patent landscape analysis is a tool used to identify trends in different areas of innovations. Patents and patent applications were extracted from Orbit Intelligence. The keyword based search process was refined by manual selection and grouped into prevention, treatment and diagnosis categories. The absolute number and legal status of patent families, priority years, priority countries, and assignees were examined. The total number of patents of dental caries in primary teeth was 61. According to the legal status of the patents, 27% are granted, 19% pending and 54% are dead. The earliest patent is from 1931 and the most recent is from 2018. Regarding the field of inventions, 37 patents were identified as prevention, 16 patents were treatment and 8 were diagnostics related. China holds the most patents. The huge burden of dental caries in primary teeth is poorly represented in global research and development. Additionally, inventions in dental caries of the primary dentition from the European Union lagged far behind China and the US, highlighting our insufficient research initiatives and programs.", "There is evidence that heavy cannabis use is associated with decrements in cognitive performance, but findings are mixed and studies are often limited by small sample sizes and narrow adjustment for potential confounding variables. In a comparatively large sample, the current study examined associations between multiple indicators of cannabis use in relation to performance on a variety of neuropsychological tasks.\nParticipants were 1121 adults (54% female) enrolled in the Human Connectome Project. Cannabis involvement comprised recent cannabis use (positive tetrahydrocannabinol screen), total number of lifetime uses, cannabis use disorder and age at first use. The neuropsychological battery comprised performance in episodic memory, fluid intelligence, attention, working memory, executive function, impulsive decision-making, processing speed and psychomotor dexterity. Covariates were age, sex, income, family structure and alcohol and tobacco use.\nPositive urinary tetrahydrocannabinol status was associated with worse performance in episodic memory and processing speed, and positive cannabis use disorder status was associated with lower fluid intelligence (all p < 0.005). No other significant associations were present.\nThe sample was limited to young adults aged 22\u201336 years. The measures of cannabis involvement were relatively coarse.\nBeyond an array of potential confounders, recent cannabis use was associated with deficits in memory and psychomotor performance, and cannabis use disorder was associated with lower overall cognitive functioning in a large normative sample of adults. The findings pertaining to recent use have particular relevance for occupational settings.", "The life sciences now interface broadly with information technology (IT) and cybersecurity. This convergence is a key driver in the explosion of biotechnology research and its industrial applications in health care, agriculture, manufacturing, automation, artificial intelligence, and synthetic biology. As the information and handling mechanisms for biological materials have become increasingly digitized, many market sectors are now vulnerable to threats at the digital interface. This growing landscape will be addressed by cyberbiosecurity, the emerging field at the convergence of both the life sciences and IT disciplines. This manuscript summarizes the current cyberbiosecurity landscape, identifies existing vulnerabilities, and calls for formalized collaboration across a swath of disciplines to develop frameworks for early response systems to anticipate, identify, and mitigate threats in this emerging domain.", "Artificial intelligence and augmented reality have been progressively incorporated into our daily life. Technological advancements have resulted in the permeation of similar systems into medical practice.\nBoth artificial intelligence and augmented reality are being increasingly incorporated into the practice of modern medicine to optimize decision making and ultimately improve patient outcomes.\nArtificial intelligence has already been incorporated into many areas of medical practice but has been slow to catch on in clinical gynecology. However, several applications of augmented reality are currently in use in gynecologic surgery. We present an overview of artificial intelligence and augmented reality and current use in medical practice with a focus on gynecology.", "Echocardiography has a central role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Precise and reliable echocardiographic assessment is required for clinical decision-making. Even if the development of new technologies (3-dimentional echocardiography, speckle-tracking, semi-automated analysis, etc.), the final decision on analysis is strongly dependent on operator experience. Diagnostic errors are a major unresolved problem. Moreover, not only can cardiologists differ from one another in image interpretation, but also the same observer may come to different findings when a reading is repeated. Daily high workloads in clinical practice may lead to this error, and all cardiologists require precise perception in this field. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve analysis and interpretation of medical images to a new stage compared with previous algorithms. From our comprehensive review, we believe AI has the potential to improve accuracy of diagnosis, clinical management, and patient care. Although there are several concerns about the required large dataset and \"black box\" algorithm, AI can provide satisfactory results in this field. In the future, it will be necessary for cardiologists to adapt their daily practice to incorporate AI in this new stage of echocardiography.", "Detailed clinical documentation is required in the patient-facing specialty of radiation oncology. The burden of clinical documentation has increased significantly with the introduction of electronic health records and participation in payer-mandated quality initiatives. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to reduce the burden of data entry associated with clinical documentation, provide clinical decision support, improve quality and value, and integrate patient data from multiple sources. The authors discuss key elements of an AI-enhanced clinic and review some emerging technologies in the industry. Challenges regarding data privacy, regulation, and medicolegal liabilities must be addressed for such AI technologies to be successful.", "This study contributes to knowledge on psychosomatic research by examining a moderated mediation model in which emotional intelligence (EI) is related to mental health, physical health and suicide risk through perceived stress, in samples of short-term (n = 364) and long-term (n = 594) unemployed individuals. The moderating effect of emotional intelligence on the relationships between perceived stress and mental and physical health and suicide risk was tested. The results showed that emotional intelligence was positively associated with mental and physical health and negatively associated with perceived stress and suicide risk. The proposed model only predicted mental health and suicide risk in the long-term unemployed sample. This suggests that emotional intelligence may act as a buffer against the negative impact of unemployment-related stress on mental health and suicide risk when unemployment is prolonged. Therefore, interventions targeting both the promotion of mental health and the prevention of suicide risk via the promotion of emotional abilities may consider length of unemployment.", "Recently there have been significant advances in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) centered around imaging-based applications such as computer vision. In particular, the tremendous power of deep learning algorithms, primarily based on convolutional neural network strategies, is becoming increasingly apparent and has already had direct impact on the fields of radiology and nuclear medicine. While most early applications of computer vision to radiological imaging have focused on classification of images into disease categories, it is also possible to use these methods to improve image quality. Hybrid imaging approaches, such as PET/MRI and PET/CT, are ideal for applying these methods.\nThis review will give an overview of the application of AI to improve image quality for PET imaging directly and how the additional use of anatomic information from CT and MRI can lead to further benefits. For PET, these performance gains can be used to shorten imaging scan times, with improvement in patient comfort and motion artifacts, or to push towards lower radiotracer doses. It also opens the possibilities for dual tracer studies, more frequent follow-up examinations, and new imaging indications. How to assess quality and the potential effects of bias in training and testing sets will be discussed.\nHarnessing the power of these new technologies to extract maximal information from hybrid PET imaging will open up new vistas for both research and clinical applications with associated benefits in patient care.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications have already invaded our everyday life, and the last 10 years have seen the emergence of very promising applications in the field of medicine. However, the literature dealing with the potential applications of IA in Orthognathic Surgery is remarkably poor to date. Yet, it is very likely that due to its amazing power in image recognition AI will find tremendous applications in dento-facial deformities recognition in a near future. In this article, we point out the state-of-the-art AI applications in medicine and its potential applications in the field of orthognathic surgery. AI is a very powerful tool and it is the responsibility of the entire medical profession to achieve a positive symbiosis between clinical sense and AI.", "Higher cognitive ability is reliably linked to better performance on chronometric tasks (i.e., faster reaction times, RT), yet the neural basis of these effects remains unclear. Anticipatory processes represent compelling yet understudied potential mechanisms of these effects, which may facilitate performance through reducing the uncertainty surrounding the temporal onset of stimuli (temporal uncertainty) and/or facilitating motor readiness despite uncertainty about impending target locations (target uncertainty). Specifically, the contingent negative variation (CNV) represents a compelling candidate mechanism of anticipatory motor planning, while the alpha oscillation is thought to be sensitive to temporal contingencies in perceptual systems. The current study undertook a secondary analysis of a large data set (n\u00a0=\u00a091) containing choice RT, cognitive ability, and EEG measurements to help clarify these issues. Single-trial EEG analysis in conjunction with mixed-effects modeling revealed that higher fluid intelligence corresponded to faster RT on average. When considered together, temporal and target uncertainty moderated the RT-ability relationship, with higher ability being associated with greater resilience to both types of uncertainty. Target uncertainty attenuated the amplitude of the CNV for all participants, but higher ability individuals were more resilient to this effect. Similarly, only higher ability individuals showed increased prestimulus alpha power (at left-lateralized sites) during longer, more easily anticipated interstimulus intervals. Collectively, these findings emphasize top-down anticipatory processes as likely contributors to chronometry-ability correlations.", "Having an Eye for Families? - Standardized Family Diagnostics in Socialpediatric Centres In socialpediatric centres (SPZ) children and adolescents with mental and/or physical disorders/impairments are diagnosed and treated together with their families. This cross-sectional study researches to what extent standardized family diagnostic questionnaires are used in this context. One third of the 152 German SPZ participated in this questionnaire study (N = 50). While nearly all SPZ use intelligence tests (98 %) and symptom questionnaires (100 %) (s. Sydow u. Homes, in prep.), family diagnostic is applied remarkably seldom in German socialpediatric centres up to now: Only 14 of 28 family questionnaires whose use we had evaluated systematically, ever were used by the participating SPZs. Implications for research and clinical practice are derived.\nZusammenfassung Sozialp\u00e4diatrische Zentren (SPZ) sind ambulante Einrichtungen, in denen Kinder und Jugendliche und ihre Familien mit psychischen, geistigen und k\u00f6rperlichen Erkrankungen und Behinderungen diagnostiziert und behandelt werden. Diese Querschnitt-Totalerhebungs-Studie untersucht, in welchem Umfang bisher standardisierte familiendiagnostische Verfahren an SPZs eingesetzt werden. Ein Drittel aller 152 SPZs in Deutschland nahm an der schriftlichen Befragung teil (N = 50). W\u00e4hrend von 98 % der befragten SPZs standardm\u00e4\u00dfig Intelligenztests und von 100 % der SPZs unterschiedliche Verfahren zur Symptomdiagnostik genutzt werden (s. Sydow u. Homes, in Vorb.), werden bisher familiendiagnostische Verfahren an Sozialp\u00e4diatrischen Zentren bemerkenswert selten bis nie eingesetzt. Nur 14 von 28 systematisch abgefragten familienbezogenen Frageb\u00f6gen werden von den teilnehmenden SPZs \u00fcberhaupt jemals verwendet. Implikationen f\u00fcr Forschung und klinische Praxis werden abgeleitet.", "Previous research has emphasized the importance of emotions in the development of adult and adolescent substance use. There is substantial evidence for deficits in emotional processing among teenagers with substance use, but few studies have investigated the association between emotional intelligence and adolescent substance use. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs and level of emotional intelligence among adolescents. A representative sample of high school students participated in the study (N = 2,380). Substance use patterns were assessed using data from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) Survey, and emotional intelligence was assessed with the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory Youth Version. Self-esteem and depressive symptomatology were also assessed to compare their effects on the frequency of substance use with the effect of emotional intelligence. Results demonstrated that greater difficulty in stress management and empathy predicted a higher frequency of tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis use. However, the level of emotional intelligence showed only a weak relationship to substance use habits. Latent profile analyses supported the hypothesis that different emotional patterns and problems underlie different types of psychoactive substances. Using a multiple linear regression model, the present study found that although emotional intelligence is not a key factor underlying substance use habits, it has an individual effect on substance use beyond depressive tendencies and self-esteem. These results can be applied to both drug prevention programs and interventions in substance abuse treatment.", "Gifted children learn more rapidly and effectively than others, presumably due to neurophysiological differences that affect efficiency in neuronal communication. Identifying the topological features that support its capabilities is relevant to understanding how the brain structure is related to intelligence. We proposed the analysis of the structural covariance network to assess which organizational patterns are characteristic of gifted children. The graph theory was used to analyse topological properties of structural covariance across a group of gifted children. The analysis was focused on measures of brain network integration, such as, participation coefficient and versatility, which quantifies the strength of specific modular affiliation of each regional node. We found that the gifted group network was more integrated (and less segregated) than the control group network. Brain regional nodes in the gifted group network had higher versatility and participation coefficient, indicating greater inter-modular communication mediated by connector hubs with links to many modules. Connector hubs of the networks of both groups were located mainly in association with neocortical areas (which had thicker cortex), with fewer hubs in primary or secondary neocortical areas (which had thinner cortex), as well as a few connector hubs in limbic cortex and insula. In the group of gifted children, a larger proportion of connector hubs were located in association cortex. In conclusion, gifted children have a more integrated and versatile brain network topology. This is compatible with the global workspace theory and other data linking integrative network topology to cognitive performance.", "The presented work deals with the creation of a new radial basis function artificial neural network-based model of dynamic thermo-mechanical response and damping behavior of thermoplastic elastomers in the whole temperature interval of their entire lifetime and a wide frequency range of dynamic mechanical loading. The created model is based on experimental results of dynamic mechanical analysis of the widely used thermoplastic polyurethane, which is one of the typical representatives of thermoplastic elastomers. Verification and testing of the well-trained radial basis function neural network for temperature and frequency dependence of dynamic storage modulus, loss modulus, as well as loss tangent prediction showed excellent correspondence between experimental and modeled data, including all relaxation events observed in the polymeric material under study throughout the monitored temperature and frequency interval. The radial basis function artificial neural network has been confirmed to be an exceptionally high-performance artificial intelligence tool of soft computing for the effective predicting of short-term viscoelastic behavior of thermoplastic elastomer systems based on experimental results of dynamic mechanical analysis.", "Developing subjective well-being among educational leaders is beneficial for both leaders themselves and students. Evidence has suggested that emotional intelligence has implications for the mental and physical well-being of individuals in leadership positions. This relationship has not, however, been extensively investigated among school administrators, particularly athletic directors, who can influence the lives of student-athletes. Thus, this study sought to examine the relationships among emotional intelligence, job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, and subjective well-being in high school athletic directors. Participants included 394 U.S. high school athletic directors who completed questionnaires relating to emotional intelligence, job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, and subjective well-being. The results revealed positive associations between emotional intelligence and subjective well-being and also demonstrated that both job satisfaction and emotional exhaustion mediated the emotional intelligence-subjective well-being relationship. The results highlight the role of emotional intelligence in athletic directors' subjective well-being and suggest that athletic directors should take measures to increase their emotional intelligence through professional learning opportunities and school support structures.", "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common congenital hereditary disease of low intelligence after Down syndrome. Its main pathogenic gene is fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene associated with intellectual disability, autism, and fragile X-related primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). FMR1 gene transcription leads to the absence of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). How to relieve or cure disorders associated with FXS has also become a clinically disturbing problem. Previous studies have recently shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to the pathogenesis. And it has been identified that several lncRNAs including FMR4, FMR5, and FMR6 contribute to developing FXPOI/FXTAS, originating from the FMR1 gene locus. FMR4 is a product of RNA polymerase II and can regulate the expression of relevant genes during differentiation of human neural precursor cells. FMR5 is a sense-oriented transcript while FMR6 is an antisense lncRNA produced by the 3' UTR of FMR1. FMR6 is likely to contribute to developing FXPOI, and it overlaps exons 15-17 of FMR1 as well as two microRNA binding sites. Additionally, BC1 can bind FMRP to form an inhibitory complex and lncRNA TUG1 also can control axonal development by directly interacting with FMRP through modulating SnoN-Ccd1 pathway. Therefore, these lncRNAs provide pharmaceutical targets and novel biomarkers. This review will: (1) describe the clinical manifestations and traditional pathogenesis of FXS and FXTAS/FXPOI; (2) summarize what is known about the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of FXS and FXTAS/FXPOI; and (3) provide an outlook of potential effects and future directions of lncRNAs in FXS and FXTAS/FXPOI researches.", "Use of artificial intelligence in medicine in an evolving technology which holds promise for mass screening and perhaps may even help in establishing an accurate diagnosis. The ability of complex computing is to perform pattern recognition by creating complex relationships based on input data and then comparing it with performance standards is a big step. Diabetic retinopathy is an ever-increasing problem. Early screening and timely treatment of the same can reduce the burden of sight threatening retinopathy. Any tool which can aid in quick screening of this disorder and minimize requirement of trained human resource for the same would probably be a boon for patients and ophthalmologists. In this review we discuss the current status of use of artificial intelligence in diabetic retinopathy and few other common retinal disorders.", "Forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI), like deep learning algorithms and neural networks, are being intensely explored for novel healthcare applications in areas such as imaging and diagnoses, risk analysis, lifestyle management and monitoring, health information management, and virtual health assistance. Expected benefits in these areas are wide-ranging and include increased speed in imaging, greater insight into predictive screening, and decreased healthcare costs and inefficiency. However, AI-based clinical tools also create a host of situations wherein commonly-held values and ethical principles may be challenged. In this short column, we highlight three potentially problematic aspects of AI use in healthcare: (1) dynamic information and consent, (2) transparency and ownership, and (3) privacy and discrimination. We discuss their impact on patient/client, clinician, and health institution values and suggest ways to tackle this impact. We propose that AI-related ethical challenges may represent an opportunity for growth in organizations.", "Tremendous opportunities for health research have been unlocked by the recent expansion of big data and artificial intelligence. However, this is an emergent area where recommendations for optimal use and implementation are needed. The objective of these European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) points to consider is to guide the collection, analysis and use of big data in rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders (RMDs).\nA multidisciplinary task force of 14 international experts was assembled with expertise from a range of disciplines including computer science and artificial intelligence. Based on a literature review of the current status of big data in RMDs and in other fields of medicine, points to consider were formulated. Levels of evidence and strengths of recommendations were allocated and mean levels of agreement of the task force members were calculated.\nThree overarching principles and 10 points to consider were formulated. The overarching principles address ethical and general principles for dealing with big data in RMDs. The points to consider cover aspects of data sources and data collection, privacy by design, data platforms, data sharing and data analyses, in particular through artificial intelligence and machine learning. Furthermore, the points to consider state that big data is a moving field in need of adequate reporting of methods and benchmarking, careful data interpretation and implementation in clinical practice.\nThese EULAR points to consider discuss essential issues and provide a framework for the use of big data in RMDs.", "Choosing a school that can best assist children's development has become one of the major concerns of Chinese parents. To categorize schools by where students stay after school, this paper consider boarding schools or day schools as two major school types. This study examined the relationships among emotional intelligence (EI), perceived social support (from friends and family), and resilience for 493 Chinese adolescents (male = 249, female = 244; mean age = 13.9, SD = 0.71), and investigated how school type difference impacts these relationships. This research first used a moderator analysis to investigate the effects of trait emotional intelligence on resilience by perceived social support from family and friends, respectively. Results show that social support from family was non-significant, while support from friends was significant in moderating the relationship between EI and resilience. Furthermore, a moderated moderation analysis was used to understand if moderation by school type of perceived social support differs in the effect of trait EI on resilience. Results indicated that the magnitude of the moderation by social support from friends depended on school type. For students who have lower perceived friend support, boarding school experiences provided a stronger positive relationship between trait EI and resilience than day school experience. Ways to enhance students' perceived social support are discussed, along with the limitations of the current research and recommendations for future research.", "High-performance and rapid response electrical heaters with ultraflexibility, superior heat resistance, and mechanical properties are highly desirable for the development of wearable devices, artificial intelligence, and high-performance heating systems in areas such as aerospace and the military. Herein, a facile and efficient two-step vacuum-assisted filtration followed by hot-pressing approach is presented to fabricate versatile electrical heaters based on the high-performance aramid nanofibers (ANFs) and highly conductive Ag nanowires (AgNWs). The resultant ANF/AgNW nanocomposite papers present ultraflexibility, extremely low sheet resistance (minimum Rs of 0.12 \u03a9/sq), and outstanding heat resistance (thermal degradation temperature above 500 \u00b0C) and mechanical properties (tensile strength of 285.7 MPa, tensile modulus of 6.51 GPa with a AgNW area fraction of 0.4 g/m2), benefiting from the partial embedding of AgNWs into the ANF substrate and the extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions. Moreover, the ANF/AgNW nanocomposite paper-based electrical heaters exhibit satisfyingly high heating temperatures (up to \u223c200 \u00b0C) with rapid response time (10-30 s) at low AgNW area fractions and supplied voltages (0.5-5 V) and possess sufficient heating reliability, stability, and repeatability during the long-term and repeated heating and cooling cycles. Fully functional applications of the ANF/AgNW nanocomposite paper-based electrical heaters are demonstrated, indicating their excellent potential for emerging electronic applications such as wearable devices, artificial intelligence, and high-performance heating systems.", "Objective\u3000This study aimed to clarify the effectiveness of the Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP) for mothers of developmentally delayed children.Methods\u3000The participants were 36 mothers of children using a development support classroom after a medical examination in A city. The children, aged 2 to 6 years old, were suspected to have autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on Pervasive Developmental Disorders Autism Society Japan Rating Scale (PARS) scores of 9 points or more. The investigation randomly assigned them to two groups-\"the intervention group\" and \"the control group\"-and carried out SSTP. The intervention group answered the questionnaire before and after intervention, three months later. The control group also answered the questionnaire 2 months before the intervention, before and after intervention. Thus, each group answered three times. The questionnaire used the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a Parenting Style scale (PS), the Relationship Quality Index (RQI), and the Japanese version of a Maltreatment scale (JM). For effectiveness of the intervention before and after, an analysis of covariance was carried out on the scores from the first and second questionnaires in the intervention and control groups. For effectiveness 3 months after the intervention, a repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed on the scale scores from the first to the third questionnaire in the intervention group.Results\u3000The average age of the children was 3.7\u00b11.4 years old, and the average PARS score was 20\u00b16.8. They were suspected to have ASD. The average SDQ score was 76.1\u00b118.8, and their intelligence was borderline. A significant difference was seen before and after the intervention in SDQ (the issue of action, the total of the difficulty), PS (overreaction, gab, general score), and JM scores; no significant difference was seen in RQI scores. Three months after the intervention, a lasting effect was seen in SDQ (the issue of action, the total of the difficulty, hyperkinetic) and PS (all items) scores in the intervention group.Conclusions\u3000Receiving SSTP caused a positive change in the mothers' parenting and improved the problem behavior of the children. It was suggested that SSTP was connected to the prevention of child abuse because it helped stop parents from hitting their children.", "Brain iron deposits (IDs) are indicative of microvessel dysfunction which may predispose to small vessel disease (SVD) brain damage and worsen cognition later in life. Visible perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale (CSO-PVS) are SVD features linked with microvessel dysfunction. We examined possible associations of CSO-PVS volume and count with brain IDs and cognitive abilities in 700 community-dwelling individuals from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 who underwent detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain MRI at mean age 72.7\u00a0years. Brain IDs were assessed automatically followed by manual editing. PVS were automatically assessed in the centrum semiovale and deep corona radiata supraventricular. General factors of overall cognitive function (g), processing speed (g-speed) and memory (g-memory) were used in the analyses. Median (IQR) volumes of IDs and CSO-PVS expressed as a percentage of intracranial volume were 0.0021 (0.011) and 0.22 (0.13)% respectively. Median count of CSO-PVS was 410 (IQR\u2009=\u2009201). Total volumes of CSO-PVS and ID, adjusted for head size, were correlated (Spearman \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.13, p\u00a0<\u20090.001). CSO-PVS volume, despite being correlated with all three cognitive measures, was only associated with g-memory (B\u2009=\u2009-114.5, SE\u2009=\u200948.35, p\u00a0=\u20090.018) in general linear models, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, childhood intelligence and white matter hyperintensity volume. The interaction of CSO-PVS count with diabetes (B\u2009=\u2009-0.0019, SE\u2009=\u20090.00093, p\u00a0=\u20090.041) and volume with age (B\u2009=\u20091.57, SE\u2009=\u20090.67, p\u00a0=\u20090.019) were also associated with g-memory. Linear regression models did not replicate these associations. Therefore, it does not seem that CSO-PVS burden is directly associated with general cognitive ability in older age.", "The need for all physicians to function as leaders in their various roles is becoming more widely recognized. There are increasing opportunities for physicians at all levels including Graduate Medical Education (GME) to gain leadership skills, but most of these opportunities are only for those interested. Although not an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requirement, some US graduate medical education programs have incorporated leadership training into their curricula. Interestingly, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada adopted the Leader role in its 2015 CanMEDS physician training model and requires leadership training. We sought to understand the value of a leadership training program in residency in our institution.\nOur 2017 pilot leadership training program for senior military internal medicine residents consisted of four one-hour sessions of mini-lectures, self-assessments, case discussions, and small group activities. The themes were: Introduction to Leadership, Emotional Intelligence, Teambuilding, and Conflict Management. Participants were given an 18-question survey (14 Likert scale multiple-choice questions and 4 open-ended response questions) to provide feedback about the course. The Brooke Army Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved this project as a Quality Improvement effort.\nThe survey response rate was 48.1% (26 of 54). The majority of respondents (84.6%) agreed the leadership training sessions were helpful and relevant. Following the sessions, 80.8% saw a greater role for physicians to function as leaders. Most (88.4%) agreed that these sessions helped them understand the importance of their roles as leaders, with 80.8% feeling more empowered to be leaders in their areas, 76.9% gaining a better understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses as leaders, and 80.8% feeling better prepared to meet challenges in the future. After exposure to leadership training, 73.1% indicated a plan to pursue additional leadership development opportunities. All respondents agreed that internists should be able to lead and manage a clinical team, and every respondent agreed that leadership principles should be taught in residency.\nThis pilot project supports the premise that leadership training should be integrated into GME. Initial results suggest training can improve leadership skills and inspire trainees to seek additional leadership education. Moreover, much like the published literature, residents believe they should learn about leadership during residency. While more effort is needed to determine the best approach to deliver and evaluate this content, it appears even small interventions can make a difference. Next steps for this program include developing assessment tools for observation of leadership behaviors during routine GME activities, which would allow for reinforcement of the principles being taught. Additionally, our experience has led our institution to make leadership training a requirement in all of our GME programs, and we look forward to reporting future progress. Finally, an ACGME requirement to incorporate leadership training into GME programs nationwide would prove useful, as doing so would reinforce its importance, accelerate implementation, and expand knowledge of best approaches on a national level.", "The goal of this research was to assess the support for motor speech disorders as explanatory constructs to guide research and treatment of reduced intelligibility in persons with Down syndrome (DS). Participants were the 45 adolescents with DS in the prior paper who were classified into five mutually-exclusive motor speech classifications using the Speech Disorders Classification System. An ordinal index classified participants' percentage of intelligible words in conversation as High (\u2265 85%), Moderate (80% - 84.9%), or Low (< 80%). Statistical analyses tested for significant differences in intelligibility status associated with demographic, intelligence, and language variables, and intelligibility status associated with motor speech classifications and speech, prosody, and voice variables. For the 10 participants who met criteria for concurrent Childhood Dysarthria and Childhood Apraxia of Speech at assessment, 80% had reduced (Moderate or Low) intelligibility and 20% had High intelligibility (significant effect size: 0.644). Proportionally more of the 32 participants who met criteria for either dysarthria or apraxia had reduced intelligibility (significant effect size:\u00a00.318). Low intelligibility was significantly associated with across-the-board reductions in phonemic and phonetic accuracy and with inappropriate prosody and voice. Findings are interpreted as support for motor speech disorders in adolescents with DS as explanatory constructs for their reduced intelligibility. Pending cross-validation of findings in diverse samples of persons with DS, studies are needed to assess the efficacy of motor speech classification status to guide selection of treatment methods and intelligibility targets. Abbreviations: CAS: Childhood Apraxia of Speech; CD: Childhood Dysarthria; DS: Down syndrome; II: Intelligibility Index; No MSD: No Motor Speech Disorder; OII: Ordinal Intelligibility Index; PSD: Persistent Speech Delay; SDCS: Speech Disorders Classification System; SMD: Speech Motor Delay.", "Caregivers are playing a vital role in mentally ill patients in India. Families of children with intellectual disability encounter a high degree of stress such as physical, emotional, and financial.\nThe aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the caregiver burden and depression between the special school-going children and nonschool-going children with intellectual disability.\nThe present study was conducted on caregivers of patients with intellectual disability at Radianz Health Care and Research Private Limited, Ahana Hospitals, Akash Special School, and M. S. Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation, Madurai. The Zarit Burden Interview scale was utilized to assess the level of burden experienced by the caregivers. The Major Depression Inventory scale was utilized to assess the severity of depression experienced by the caregivers. The Binet Kamat Test of Intelligence was administered by a psychologist to assess the IQ level of the children.\nTotally 80 caregivers were participated in the study. The mothers of children with intellectual disability suffered from burden and depression when compared to the fathers (P < 0.0001). The parents of nonschool-going children had a higher level of burden and depression as compared to the parents of special school-going children (P < 0.0001).\nSpecial school is playing a vital role for children with intellectual disability. It can be reasonably concluded from the study that both the groups face burden and depression. However, the severity of burden and depression is comparatively higher among parents of nonschool-going children.", "Mercury (Hg) use in artisanal gold mining in the Colombian Amazon is widespread, and little is known about the exposure on local indigenous people. The aim of this study was to assess the levels of total Hg (T-Hg) in human hair on the Yaigoj\u00e9 Apaporis National Natural Park, Colombia, at the Colombian Amazon, specifically at the communities of Bocas de Taraira, \u00d1umi, Vista Hermosa, and Bocas de Uga. Total-Hg levels were measured using a direct mercury analyzer. The mean \u00b1 SD (min-max) of the T-Hg level in human hair volunteers was 23.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u00a0\u03bcg/g (2.6-63.7\u00a0\u03bcg/g). T-Hg concentrations increase from upstream to downstream localities, with the highest average observed at Bocas de Taraira (34.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4\u00a0\u03bcg/g); to the best of our knowledge, the highest value reported for an indigenous community in Latin America. Ninety-three percent of all examined individuals had T-Hg concentrations greater than the WHO \"threshold\" level (5\u00a0\u03bcg/g) and 86% displayed levels higher than 10\u00a0\u03bcg/g in hair. Mercury levels correlated with fish consumption frequency (r\u2009=\u20090.27, p\u2009=\u20090.008). Risk assessment analysis showed that 85.5% of the analyzed participants have a 60% chance of developing adverse neurological effects and 50% of women at reproductive age are at risk of having children with intelligence quotient reduced by up to four points. Since the consumption of carnivorous fish is the main factor for Hg exposure, it is necessary to implement strategies to reduce their presence in the diet, without undermining cultural traditions. The Colombian government must assume control of this devastating situation and immediately halt mining activities in this natural park of global importance.", "The objective of the analysis of the situational expertises performed during criminal investigations consists of the confirmation (or refutation) of a concrete version of the situation of interest, the possibility of trace formation, and the availability of facts awaiting interpretation from the medical perspective. The present study was carried out with the use of such methods as recording facts, conditions, and circumstances of the versions of the event being investigated, measurements, description, comparison, experiment, modeling, mathematical and cybernetic simulation as well as euristic technologies. The concrete expertise described in the present publication revealed the possibility of the evaluation of the appearance of specific traces associated with a given situation. The author proposes the recommendation for the preparation and performance of such expertises with special reference to the algorithm of the investigator's actions.

Nonetheless, there is currently no systematic review or bibliometric analysis in the medical literature about the applications of AI in depression. We performed a bibliometric analysis of the current research landscape, which objectively evaluates the productivity of global researchers or institutions in this field, along with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and latent dirichlet allocation (LDA). From 2010 onwards, the total number of papers and citations on using AI to manage depressive disorder have risen considerably. In terms of global AI research network, researchers from the United States were the major contributors to this field. Exploratory factor analysis showed that the most well-studied application of AI was the utilization of machine learning to identify clinical characteristics in depression, which accounted for more than 60% of all publications. Latent dirichlet allocation identified specific research themes, which include diagnosis accuracy, structural imaging techniques, gene testing, drug development, pattern recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG)-based diagnosis. Although the rapid development and widespread use of AI provide various benefits for both health providers and patients, interventions to enhance privacy and confidentiality issues are still limited and require further research.", "While passive procrastination is usually associated with distress and dysfunction active procrastination may be an effective coping style. To test this possibility, we examined passive and active procrastination in terms of temperament, character, and emotional intelligence (EI), as well as by a short-term longitudinal study.\nAdult community volunteers (N\u00a0=\u00a0126) self-reported twice in an online short-term longitudinal study. At baseline on active and passive procrastination, as well as on the temperament and character inventory of personality (TCI-140) and EI. At first testing, they were asked to freely describe three personal goals and to make action plans to achieve each within the next two weeks. Two weeks later they reported on progress on their personal goals (PPG).\nPPG correlated positively with active procrastination and negatively with passive procrastination. Dividing the participants into median splits on active and passive procrastination resulted in four groups: Active, Passive, Active-Passive, and Non-Procrastinators. Analysis of variance showed that active procrastinators had an advantage in temperament and character traits as well as EI. Active procrastinators were also higher than the other groups on personality profiles i.e. combinations of traits; dependable temperament and well-developed character.\nActive procrastination can be an adaptive and productive coping style. It is associated with dependable temperament, well-developed character, and high emotional intelligence and predicts meeting personal goals.", "The aim of this systematic review was to analyse literature on artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics, including all medical imaging modalities, for oncological and non-oncological applications, in order to assess how far the image mining research stands from routine medical application. To do this, we applied a trial phases classification inspired from the drug development process.\nAmong the articles we considered for inclusion from PubMed were multimodality AI and radiomics investigations, with a validation analysis aimed at relevant clinical objectives. Quality assessment of selected papers was performed according to the QUADAS-2 criteria. We developed the phases classification criteria for image mining studies.\nOverall 34,626 articles were retrieved, 300 were selected applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 171 high-quality papers (QUADAS-2\u2009\u2265\u20097) were identified and analysed. In 27/171 (16%), 141/171 (82%), and 3/171 (2%) studies the development of an AI-based algorithm, radiomics model, and a combined radiomics/AI approach, respectively, was described. A total of 26/27(96%) and 1/27 (4%) AI studies were classified as phase II and III, respectively. Consequently, 13/141 (9%), 10/141 (7%), 111/141 (79%), and 7/141 (5%) radiomics studies were classified as phase 0, I, II, and III, respectively. All three radiomics/AI studies were categorised as phase II trials.\nThe results of the studies are promising but still not mature enough for image mining tools to be implemented in the clinical setting and be widely used. The transfer learning from the well-known drug development process, with some specific adaptations to the image mining discipline could represent the most effective way for radiomics and AI algorithms to become the standard of care tools.", "Pancreas cancer is an aggressive and fatal disease that will become one of the leading causes of cancer mortality by 2030. An all-out effort is underway to better understand the basic biologic mechanisms of this disease ranging from early development to metastatic disease. In order to change the course of this disease, diagnostic radiology imaging may play a vital role in providing a precise, noninvasive method for early diagnosis and assessment of treatment response. Recent progress in combining medical imaging, advanced image analysis and artificial intelligence, termed radiomics, can offer an innovate approach in detecting the earliest changes of tumor development as well as a rapid method for the detection of response. In this chapter, we introduce the principles of radiomics and demonstrate how it can provide additional information into tumor biology, early detection, and response assessments advancing the goals of precision imaging to deliver the right treatment to the right person at the right time.", "The relationship between openness (a psychological trait of curiosity) and a cognitive change was examined in middle-aged and older adults. Participants were 2214 men and women (baseline age range: 40 to 81 years). They were tested up to seven times over approximately 13 years. Openness at the baseline was assessed by the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Cognitive abilities were assessed at each examination using the Wechsler adult intelligence scale-revised short form, which includes information, similarities, picture completion, and digit symbol subscales. General linear mixed models comprised fixed effects of openness, age at the baseline, follow-up time, their interactions, and the covariates. The results indicated that the main effects of openness were significant for all scores. Moreover, the interaction term openness \u00d7 age \u00d7 time was significant for the information and similarities test scores, indicating that changes in the information and similarities scores differed depending on the level of openness and baseline age. The estimated trajectory indicated that the differences in slopes between participants with high and low openness were significant after 60 years of age for the information, and after 65 years of age for the similarities scores. It is concluded that openness has a protective effect on the decline in general knowledge and logical abstract thinking in old age.", "This chapter presents a historical overview of observations, instruments, and approaches in the area of neuropsychological assessment. In the 17th and 18th century literature dealing especially with language disorders following a brain disorder, one finds observations of physicians of striking dissociations of mental faculties that were impaired while others remained intact. Around the middle of the 19th century, neuropsychiatrists like Carl Wernicke began to develop procedures for assessing more specific components of mental functioning. German physicians, Conrad Rieger and Theodor Ziehen, seem to have developed the first neuropsychological test batteries. Kurt Goldstein, inspired by the rising Gestalt theory, argued that not the test score but the strategy used by a patient to perform a task is important. Alexander Luria also promoted an approach to assessment that was mainly based on subjective judgment. Studies on individual differences led to the development of an intelligence test battery by Alfred Binet. This battery was later transformed into the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests for selecting soldiers. Components of these intelligence tests have survived in the test kit of the modern neuropsychologist. This tradition also stimulated the development of psychometric analysis of tests. Two pioneers in the field of neuropsychological assessment were Shepherd Ivory Franz, favoring a clinical approach, and Ward Halstead, stimulating a strongly psychometric-based approach. The evaluation of language disorders has always been a specific area, requiring its own set of tests. The first comprehensive language battery was compiled by Bastian. Around the middle of the 20th century, when the localization of function approach had been rejected, neurologists preferred to examine language disorders clinically, using a battery that evaluated speech, comprehension, reading, and writing.", "To investigate the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosis, treatment and outcome predictionin urologic diseases and evaluate its advantages over traditional models and methods.\nA literature search was performed after PROSPERO registration (CRD42018103701) and in compliance with Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methods. Articles between 1994 and 2018 using the search terms \"urology\", \"artificial intelligence\", \"machine learning\" were included and categorized by the application of AI in urology. Review articles, editorial comments, articles with no full-text access, and nonurologic studies were excluded.\nInitial search yielded 231 articles, but after excluding duplicates and following full-text review and examination of article references, only 111 articles were included in the final analysis. AI applications in urology include: utilizing radiomic imaging or ultrasonic echo data to improve or automate cancer detection or outcome prediction, utilizing digitized tissue specimen images to automate detection of cancer on pathology slides, and combining patient clinical data, biomarkers, or gene expression to assist disease diagnosis or outcome prediction. Some studies employed AI to plan brachytherapy and radiation treatments while others used video based or robotic automated performance metrics to objectively evaluate surgical skill. Compared to conventional statistical analysis, 71.8% of studies concluded that AI is superior in diagnosis and outcome prediction.\nAI has been widely adopted in urology. Compared to conventional statistics AI approaches are more accurate in prediction and more explorative for analyzing large data cohorts. With an increasing library of patient data accessible to clinicians, AI may help facilitate evidence-based and individualized patient care.", "Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) is a promising technology for power efficient hardware in applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) implemented in non-von Neumann architectures. However, there is an unanswered question if the device non-idealities preclude the use of RRAM devices in this potentially disruptive technology. Here we investigate the question for the case of inference. Using experimental results from silicon oxide (SiO x ) RRAM devices, that we use as proxies for physical weights, we demonstrate that acceptable accuracies in classification of handwritten digits (MNIST data set) can be achieved using non-ideal devices. We find that, for this test, the ratio of the high- and low-resistance device states is a crucial determinant of classification accuracy, with ~96.8% accuracy achievable for ratios >3, compared to ~97.3% accuracy achieved with ideal weights. Further, we investigate the effects of a finite number of discrete resistance states, sub-100% device yield, devices stuck at one of the resistance states, current/voltage non-linearities, programming non-linearities and device-to-device variability. Detailed analysis of the effects of the non-idealities will better inform the need for the optimization of particular device properties.", "Automatic emotion recognition has become an important trend in many artificial intelligence (AI) based applications and has been widely explored in recent years. Most research in the area of automated emotion recognition is based on facial expressions or speech signals. Although the influence of the emotional state on body movements is undeniable, this source of expression is still underestimated in automatic analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method to recognise seven basic emotional states-namely, happy, sad, surprise, fear, anger, disgust and neutral-utilising body movement. We analyse motion capture data under seven basic emotional states recorded by professional actor/actresses using Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor. We propose a new representation of affective movements, based on sequences of body joints. The proposed algorithm creates a sequential model of affective movement based on low level features inferred from the spacial location and the orientation of joints within the tracked skeleton. In the experimental results, different deep neural networks were employed and compared to recognise the emotional state of the acquired motion sequences. The experimental results conducted in this work show the feasibility of automatic emotion recognition from sequences of body gestures, which can serve as an additional source of information in multimodal emotion recognition.", "The Israeli Ministry of Health has set up the foundations of a National Pharmacovigilance System. The next step is to adopt the best of the international ideas, trends and approaches which are shaping the future of pharmacovigilance. Specifically: 1) The risk management approach requires proactively preventing or minimizing risks, starting in early clinical development and extending all along the lifecycle of a pharmaceutical. 2) Drug safety is a multidisciplinary discipline where all stakeholders should be involved. 3) Clinical trials provide an ideal safety profile limited to the restrictive conditions of the trial. Only real-world data, from the post marketing period, will reveal the real risk/benefit balance for the use of a pharmaceutical in regular clinical care. 4) Artificial intelligence is needed to analyze the large amount of data collected through the post-marketing studies, electronic medical records and the internet. Many AI tools have been developed to support better use of pharmaceuticals. 5) Quality-oriented, thorough inspections and audits are critical for achieving patient safety. 6) Patients should be recognized as active players in their treatment who can, and should, have access to safety information through the major agencies' websites.Israel can benefit from several of its key assets to reach a higher level of pharmacovigilance: 1) Israel's four HMOs are organized in a way that allows them to have quick and efficient dialogue with healthcare professionals and with patients. Moreover, a new project named, Big Data in Health, will pool the epidemiologic databases of the HMOs, providing precious information for understanding risk factors, detecting alerts, and developing personalized medicine. 2) Formal risk management activities have long been part of the culture of hospitals and should be applied increasingly to ensuring drug safety.Israel has the organizational, scientific, technological and cultural resources needed to quickly overcome the challenges and go beyond its current state to build a unique pharmacovigilance system which could serve as an example for other countries.", "Executive functions (EFs) comprise a group of cognitive processes that selectively control and regulate attention. Inverse relations have been reported between EFs and BMI. However, the mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood.\nWe aimed to decompose the inverse relation between EFs and BMI into genetic and environmental components.\nWe employed a cross-sectional analysis of data from 869 twins aged 7-15 y from the Texas Twin Project, who completed a neuropsychological test battery measuring 4 EFs (switching, inhibitory control, working memory, and updating); academic achievement (reading and mathematics); and general cognitive abilities (general intelligence/intelligence quotient; crystallized and fluid intelligence; and processing speed). Participants also had their height and weight measured.\nAfter controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, BMI was inversely associated with a general EF factor representing the capacity to control and regulate goal-oriented behaviors (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.125; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01; Q\u00a0=\u00a00.04). This inverse BMI-EF association was due to a significant overlap in genetic factors contributing to each phenotype (genetic correlation, rA, =\u00a0-0.15; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Shared genetic influences accounted for 80% of the phenotypic association.\nChildren with higher general EF have lower BMIs, and this association is primarily attributable to shared genetic influences on both phenotypes. The results emphasize that higher weight associates not only with physical sequelae, but also with important cognitive attributes. This work adds to a growing body of research suggesting there are sets of genetic variants common across physical health and cognitive functioning.", "A set of electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 29 subjects obtained from a study, in which the subjects performed a set of tests based on visual stimuli and motor images of the hands is presented. Three types of data are provided in this article: (1) Signals based on visual events (VEP), (2) signals based on steady state visual events (SSVEP) and (3) signals based upon Motor Imagery (MI). Several research projects have used this data to test the detection of visual stimuli, classification and selection of characteristics of brain signals, EEG preprocessing and for optimization processes based on heuristic algorithms and algorithms based upon collective animal intelligence. The data was acquired using an Emotiv Epoc\u00a0+\u00a0portable EEG with 14 data channels and two reference channels.", "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often lack cognitive empathy, so they experience difficulty in empathizing with others. Although deficits in social abilities, such as empathy, have been demonstrated in previous studies, most stimuli used in previous studies were developed for typically developing (TD) individuals. Previous studies have demonstrated that adults with and without ASD display empathetic responses toward similar others. Adults with ASD (n = 22, 7 women and 15 men, mean age = 26.8 years) and intelligence- and age-matched TD adults (n = 20, 8 women and 12 men, mean age = 24.0 years) participated in the study. They were instructed to read 24 stories (12 stories featured protagonists with characteristics of ASD, and the other 12 featured TD protagonists) and respond to the following questions: \"How did the protagonist feel?\" and \"Would you help if the protagonist were in trouble?\" After controlling for alexithymia and AQ based on multiple regression analyses, individuals with ASD empathize with other people who have ASD and are motivated to help other people with ASD. Additionally, social skills and attention to detail were associated with decreased helping motivation for story characters with ASD. Social skills among AQ subscales (social skills, attention switching, attention to detail, communication, and imagination) were the most potent predictor of decreased helping motivation. These findings suggest that the reason why individuals with ASD are considered to have limited cognitive empathy and helping motivation could be related to alexithymia and the lack of social skills and attention to detail, which are related to atypical perception.", "To comprehensively describe intellectual and executive functioning (EF) in people with dyskinetic cerebral palsy (DCP), by comparing their performance with that of: 1) age- and sex-matched typically developing controls (TDC); and 2) participants with spastic cerebral palsy (SCP) matched for age, sex, term/preterm and gross motor function classification system (GMFCS).\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted by the University of Barcelona in collaboration with five institutions. Participants were people with DCP (n\u00a0=\u00a052; 24 females, median age 20.5\u00a0y: 5mo, interquartile range [IQR]\u00a0=\u00a013.75\u00a0y: 7mo; GMFCS I-V). As comparison groups, participants with SCP (n\u00a0=\u00a020; 10 females, median age\u00a0=\u00a020.5\u00a0y: 5.5mo, IQR\u00a0=\u00a013.75\u00a0y 9mo; GMFCS I-V) and TDC (n\u00a0=\u00a052; 24 females, median age\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0y: 4mo, IQR\u00a0=\u00a012\u00a0y 7mo) were included. Intelligence and EF were assessed using common tests in all participants.\nBoth CP groups had lower intelligence than TDC and performed poorer in almost all EF tasks. Intelligence was higher in DCP than SCP (z\u00a0=\u00a0-2.51, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Participants with DCP also performed significantly better in goal-setting tasks (z\u00a0=\u00a02.27, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and information processing (z\u00a0=\u00a0-2.54, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) than those with SCP.\nPeople with DCP present lower general intellectual functioning and poorer EF across multiple domains than typically developing controls. People with DCP have higher general intellectual functioning and better EF than people with SCP when levels of motor severity are similar.", "In ambulant psychiatric care, intellectual disability (id) is often not recognised. Therefore, a Screener for Intelligence and Learning disabilities (scil) was recently introduced to assist recognition. However, because, current therapy is not adjusted for id-related problems, its effectiveness remains unknown.<br/> AIM: To gain insight into adequate adaptation of interventions by professionals for patients with severe mental illness (smi) and id, to improve the quality of care without the need to develop a completely new program of therapy.<br/> METHOD: A qualitative design (n=15) including 8 interviews and one focus group, among psychiatric practitioners and id experts.<br/> RESULTS: Five main themes were identified to adjust therapy: treatment, communication, inclusion of the network, estimation of support needs and self-management. CONCLUSIONS To align therapy with the requirements of patients with smi and id, a patient-oriented approach to care is necessary. Simple but effective modifications, summarised in a toolkit, appear to contribute to this. To offer appropriate care to patients with smi and id, attention is needed for both a support-oriented and a recovery-oriented approach.", "In adults with autism spectrum disorder, co-occurring psychiatric conditions are prevalent, and depression is one of the most common co-occurring disorders. This study examined the relationship between depression and cognitive ability, autism symptom severity, and self-reported social impairments in autism spectrum disorder. A total of 33 adults with autism spectrum disorder and 28 adults with typical development completed a standardized psychiatric interview, cognitive test, measure of clinician-rated autism symptom severity, and self-report of social impairments. Nine participants with autism spectrum disorder (27%) met the criteria for a depressive disorder (autism spectrum disorder\u2009+\u2009depressive disorder). Relatively more females with autism spectrum disorder had a co-occurring depressive disorder. The typical development group had a higher intelligence quotient than the autism spectrum disorder group, but the autism spectrum disorder\u2009+\u2009depressive disorder group did not differ from the typical development or autism spectrum disorder group. While the autism spectrum disorder\u2009+\u2009depressive disorder group had lower clinician-rated autism symptom severity than the autism spectrum disorder group, the autism spectrum disorder\u2009+\u2009depressive disorder group reported more social impairments than the autism spectrum disorder group. Self-reported social impairments predicted depression in adults with autism spectrum disorder when accounting for symptom severity and cognitive ability. These findings suggest that more self-perceived social impairments are related to depressive disorders in autism spectrum disorder, and may help clinicians identify individuals who are vulnerable in developing a co-occurring depressive disorder. Future directions include follow-up studies with larger cohorts and longitudinal designs to support inferences regarding directionality of these relationships.", "This article relates the intelligence testing experiments conducted by Isa\u00edas Alves and Noemy Silveira to the broader context of how psychological concepts moved within the Brazilian educational field. Their work acts as a resource to understand how this movement occurred, indicating the different events that helped shape the understanding of this tool. The goal is to show how, even despite their similar initial interests and shared experience at Columbia University, Alves and Silveira did not use the same strategies during their work to apply these tests in schools while they both headed psychology services for the boards of education in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\nO artigo relaciona as experi\u00eancias com testes de intelig\u00eancia realizadas por Isa\u00edas Alves e Noemy Silveira com o contexto de circula\u00e7\u00e3o das concep\u00e7\u00f5es de psicologia no campo educacional brasileiro.

The present study thus investigated the effects of AMC training on VSWM and its neural correlates. A total of 144 human subjects (67 boys) were assigned to AMC or control groups at their entry to primary school. The AMC group received 2 h AMC training per week for 5 school years, whereas the control group spent the time in activities, such as conventional calculation and reading. Raven's Intelligence Test was administered both before and after training. Two arithmetic tests and a VSWM task were conducted after training. Among these participants, fMRI data were collected from 64 children for the VSWM task. Behavioral results indicated that the AMC group outperformed controls on both arithmetic and VSWM tasks, but not on Raven's Intelligence Test. While the two groups activated similar regions during the VSWM task, the AMC group showed greater activation than the controls in frontal, parietal, and occipital areas. Interestingly, the activation of right middle frontal gyrus mediated the relation between the arithmetic ability and the VSWM performance in the AMC group, suggesting that the frontal region may be the neural substrate underlying the transfer effect from AMC training to VSWM. Although the transfer effects seem quite limited considering the length and intensity of the training, these findings suggest that long-term AMC training not only improves arithmetic ability but also has a potential positive effect on VSWM.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Plasticity of working memory is one of the most rapidly expanding research fields in the developmental and cognitive sciences. Previous studies suggest that abacus-based mental calculation (AMC) relies on a visuospatial imaginary strategy, which is closely related to visuospatial working memory (VSWM). However, the impacts of AMC training on VSWM and the underlying neural basis remain unclear. Here, we found that AMC training enhanced VSWM in children, which was accompanied by altered activation in frontal, parietal, and occipital areas. Moreover, we observed that activation in right middle frontal gyrus played a significant mediation role in the transfer of AMC training to VSWM. These findings provide a new perspective to VSWM training and also advance our understanding of related brain plasticity.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) classification holds promise as a novel and affordable screening tool for clinical management of ocular diseases. Rural and underserved areas, which suffer from lack of access to experienced ophthalmologists may particularly benefit from this technology. Quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) imaging provides excellent capability to identify subtle vascular distortions, which are useful for classifying retinovascular diseases. However, application of AI for differentiation and classification of multiple eye diseases is not yet established. In this study, we demonstrate supervised machine learning based multi-task OCTA classification. We sought 1) to differentiate normal from diseased ocular conditions, 2) to differentiate different ocular disease conditions from each other, and 3) to stage the severity of each ocular condition. Quantitative OCTA features, including blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vascular caliber (BVC), vessel perimeter index (VPI), blood vessel density (BVD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area (FAZ-A), and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) were fully automatically extracted from the OCTA images. A stepwise backward elimination approach was employed to identify sensitive OCTA features and optimal-feature-combinations for the multi-task classification. For proof-of-concept demonstration, diabetic retinopathy (DR) and sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) were used to validate the supervised machine leaning classifier. The presented AI classification methodology is applicable and can be readily extended to other ocular diseases, holding promise to enable a mass-screening platform for clinical deployment and telemedicine.", "The use of artificial intelligence in medicine is currently an issue of great interest, especially with regard to the diagnostic or predictive analysis of medical data. In order to achieve the regional medical and public health data analysis through artificial intelligence technologies, spark data analysis is adopted as the research platform for hypertension patients, and artificial intelligence technologies are used to preprocess the data with inconsistency, redundancy, incompleteness, noise and error; Aiming at the unbalanced data sets, the Z-score standard is adopted to convert data into usable form suitable for data mining. And, the application of Logistic, Naive Bayesian regression, and support vector machine based on three groups of different prognosis in severe cases, including stroke, heart failure and renal failure symptoms, establish the risk early warning model for 3\u00a0years time. In addition, to select the optimal feature subset based on medicine big-data features, the model simplification and optimization are done in training process, the experimental results show that the feature subset selection can ensure the classification performance similar to the clinical features of the model. Therefore, according to chronic cardiovascular disease, acute cardiovascular events and cardiovascular events caused by critical illness events, we screen out the relevant prognosis of serious illness (stroke, heart failure, renal failure), which is related to the prognosis of serious illness. Targeted prevention has a guiding role and practical significance according to the results of artificial intelligence analysis.", "This study uses a novel framework based on work by Shipstead, Harrison, and Engle (2016) that includes measures of both working memory capacity and fluid intelligence in an attempt to better understand the processes that influence successful reading comprehension at the latent level. Further, we extend this framework to a second educationally relevant ability: second-language vocabulary learning. A large sample of young adults received a battery of working memory, fluid intelligence, language comprehension, and memory updating tasks. The results indicate that individual differences in reading comprehension and vocabulary learning benefit from the ability to maintain active information, as well as to disengage from no longer relevant information. Subsequently, we provide an interpretation of our results based on the maintenance and disengagement framework proposed by Shipstead et al. (2016).

The proposed model tested the mediator role of flourishing in the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and suicide risk together with the moderating effect of EI in the relationship between low flourishing and increased suicide risk. Considering an initial sample of 1847 adolescents (52.5% female), a subsample of 494 pure bullying victims (61.3% female) took part in this research. The main results showed EI to be linked to decreased suicide risk through levels of flourishing. Moreover, EI buffered the relationship between low flourishing and the associated suicide risk. Victimized adolescents with both low levels of EI and of flourishing reported higher levels of suicide risk than their counterparts with high EI levels. This suggests the protective role of EI of both predicting higher flourishing and reducing the likelihood of suicide risk among victimized adolescents with low levels of flourishing. Finally, the practical implications of these novel findings regarding the role of EI and flourishing in the prevention of suicide risk among victimized adolescents are discussed.", "Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of physical disability in children, with an estimated 600-700 infants born with CP in Australia each year. CP is typically associated with motor impairments, but nearly half of all children with CP also experience cognitive impairment, potentially impacting educational and vocational achievement. This paper reports the protocol for a randomised controlled trial of a computerised cognitive training intervention based on behavioural principles: Strengthening Mental Abilities through Relational Training (SMART). The study aims to investigate SMART's effect on fluid reasoning, executive function and academic achievement in children with CP.\nSixty children with mild to moderate CP (Gross Motor Function Classification Scale I-IV) aged between 8 years and 12 years will be recruited. Participants will be randomly allocated to two groups: SMART cognitive training and waitlist control. Families will access the programme at home over a 4-month period. Assessments will be administered at baseline, 20\u2009weeks and at 40\u2009week follow-up for retention. The primary outcome will be fluid intelligence, while academic achievement, executive function and social and emotional well-being will be secondary outcomes.\nThis study has approval from the Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service Research Ethics Committee (HREC/14/QRCH/377) and The University of Queensland (2017001806). If the computerised cognitive training programme is found to be effective, dissemination of these findings would assist children with CP by providing an accessible, cost-effective intervention that can be completed at home at the individual's own pace.\nThe study was registered prospectively on 10 November 2017 to present. Recruitment is now under way, and we aim to complete recruitment by June 2019, with data collection finalised by March 2020.\nACTRN12617001550392; Pre-results.", "Cognitive impairment is a clinically important feature of schizophrenia. Polygenic risk score (PRS) methods have demonstrated genetic overlap between schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), educational attainment (EA), and IQ, but very few studies have examined associations between these PRS and cognitive phenotypes within schizophrenia cases.\nWe combined genetic and cognitive data in 3034 schizophrenia cases from 11 samples using the general intelligence factor g as the primary measure of cognition. We used linear regression to examine the association between cognition and PRS for EA, IQ, schizophrenia, BD, and MDD. The results were then meta-analyzed across all samples. A genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cognition was conducted in schizophrenia cases.\nPRS for both population IQ (P = 4.39 \u00d7 10-28) and EA (P = 1.27 \u00d7 10-26) were positively correlated with cognition in those with schizophrenia. In contrast, there was no association between cognition in schizophrenia cases and PRS for schizophrenia (P = .39), BD (P = .51), or MDD (P = .49). No individual variant approached genome-wide significance in the GWAS.\nCognition in schizophrenia cases is more strongly associated with PRS that index cognitive traits in the general population than PRS for neuropsychiatric disorders. This suggests the mechanisms of cognitive variation within schizophrenia are at least partly independent from those that predispose to schizophrenia diagnosis itself. Our findings indicate that this cognitive variation arises at least in part due to genetic factors shared with cognitive performance in populations and is not solely due to illness or treatment-related factors, although our findings are consistent with important contributions from these factors.", "Burn critical care represents a high impact population that may benefit from artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML). Acute kidney injury (AKI) recognition in burn patients could be enhanced by ML. The goal of this study was to determine the theoretical performance of ML in augmenting AKI recognition.\nWe developed ML models using the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. The ML models were trained-tested with clinical laboratory data for 50 adult burn patients that had neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), urine output (UOP), creatinine, and N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measured within the first 24\u2009h of admission.\nHalf of patients (50%) in the dataset experienced AKI within the first week following admission. ML models containing NGAL, creatinine, UOP, and NT-proBNP achieved 90-100% accuracy for identifying AKI. ML models containing only NT-proBNP and creatinine achieved 80-90% accuracy. Mean time-to-AKI recognition using UOP and/or creatinine alone was achieved within 42.7\u2009\u00b1\u200923.2\u2009h post-admission vs. within 18.8\u2009\u00b1\u20098.1\u2009h via the ML-algorithm.\nThe performance of UOP and creatinine for predicting AKI could be enhanced by with a ML algorithm using a k-NN approach when NGAL is not available. Additional studies are needed to verify performance of ML for burn-related AKI.", "Intelligence differences of individuals are attributed to the structural and functional differences of the brain. Neural processing operations of the human brain vary according to the difficulty level of the problem and the intelligence level of individuals. In this study, we used a bimodal system consisting of functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) to investigate these inter-individual differences. A continuous wave 32-channel fNIRS from OxyMonfNIRS device (Artinis) and 19-channel EEG from (g.tec's company) were utilized to study the oxygenation procedure as well as the electrical activity of the brain when doing the problems of Raven's Progressive Matrix (RPM) intelligence test. We used this information to estimate the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of the individual without performing a complete logical-mathematical intelligence test in a long-time period and examining the answers of people to the questions. After EEG preprocessing, different features including Higuchi's fractal dimension, Shannon entropy values from wavelet transform coefficients, and average power of frequency sub-bands were extracted. Clean fNIRS signals were also used to compute features such as slope, mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness, and peak. Then dimension reduction algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to select an effective feature set from fNIRS and EEG in order to improve the IQ estimation process. We utilized two regression methods, i.e., Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), to extract optimum models for the IQ determination. The best regression models based on fNIRS-EEG and fNIRS presented 3.093% and 3.690% relative error for 11 subjects, respectively.", "Since the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in 1955, the applications of AI have increased over the years within a rapidly changing digital landscape where public expectations are on the rise, fed by social media, industry leaders, and medical practitioners. However, there has been little interest in AI in medical education until the last two decades, with only a recent increase in the number of publications and citations in the field. To our knowledge, thus far, a limited number of articles have discussed or reviewed the current use of AI in medical education.\nThis study aims to review the current applications of AI in medical education as well as the challenges of implementing AI in medical education.\nMedline (Ovid), EBSCOhost Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Education Source, and Web of Science were searched with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text of the selected articles was analyzed using the Extension of Technology Acceptance Model and the Diffusions of Innovations theory.

Three primary uses of AI in medical education were identified: learning support (n=32), assessment of students' learning (n=4), and curriculum review (n=1). The main reasons for use of AI are its ability to provide feedback and a guided learning pathway and to decrease costs. Subgroup analysis revealed that medical undergraduates are the primary target audience for AI use. In addition, 34 articles described the challenges of AI implementation in medical education; two main reasons were identified: difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of AI in medical education and technical challenges while developing AI applications.\nThe primary use of AI in medical education was for learning support mainly due to its ability to provide individualized feedback. Little emphasis was placed on curriculum review and assessment of students' learning due to the lack of digitalization and sensitive nature of examinations, respectively. Big data manipulation also warrants the need to ensure data integrity. Methodological improvements are required to increase AI adoption by addressing the technical difficulties of creating an AI application and using novel methods to assess the effectiveness of AI. To better integrate AI into the medical profession, measures should be taken to introduce AI into the medical school curriculum for medical professionals to better understand AI algorithms and maximize its use.", "The detection of pulmonary nodules is a key step to achieving the early diagnosis and therapy of lung cancer. Deep learning based Artificial intelligence (AI) presents as the state of the art in the area of nodule detection, however, a validation with clinical data is necessary for further application. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of AI in the detection of malignant and non-calcified nodules in chest CT.\nTwo hundred chest computed tomography (CT) data were randomly selected from a self-built nodule database from Tianjin Medical University General Hospital. Both the pathology confirmed lung cancers and the nodules in the process of follow-up were included. All CTs were processed by AI and the results were compared with that of radiologists retrieved from the original medical reports. The ground truths were further determined by two experienced radiologists. The size and characteristics of the nodules were evaluated as well. The sensitivity and false positive rate were used to evaluate the effectiveness of AI and radiologists in detecting nodules. The McNemar test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference.\nA total of 889 non-calcified nodules were determined by experts on chest CT, including 133 lung cancers. Of them, 442 nodules were less than 5 mm. The cancer detection rates of AI and radiologists are 100%. The sensitivity of AI on nodule detection was significantly higher than that of radiologists (99.1% vs 43%, P<0.001). The false-positive rate of AI was 4.9 per CT and decreased to 1.5 when nodules less than 5 mm were excluded.\nAI achieves the detection of all malignancies and improve the sensitivity of pulmonary nodules detection beyond radiologists, with a low false positive rate after excluding small nodules.\n\u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u9898\u76ee\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u80f8\u90e8CT\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u76ee\u7684 \u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u7cbe\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u80ba\u764c\u65e9\u8bca\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u80ba\u5185\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u6548\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5728\u80f8\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\uff08computed tomography, CT\uff09\u6076\u6027\u53ca\u975e\u9499\u5316\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u51fa\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5 \u7531\u5929\u6d25\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66\u603b\u533b\u9662\u81ea\u5efa\u80f8\u90e8CT\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u53d6200\u4f8b\u80f8\u90e8CT\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u75c5\u7406\u8bc1\u5b9e\u7684\u80ba\u764c\u53ca\u968f\u8bbf\u7ed3\u8282\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u5bfc\u5165\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u8f6f\u4ef6\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7ed3\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u5f71\u50cf\u62a5\u544a\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53ca\u9605\u7247\u8005\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u8282\u75312\u540d\u80f8\u90e8\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u5176\u5927\u5c0f\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3001\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53ca\u533b\u5e08\u7684\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u5e94\u7528McNemar\u68c0\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e8c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u7ed3\u679c 200\u4f8b\u80f8\u90e8\u591a\u5c42\u87ba\u65cbCT\u5171\u5305\u542b\u975e\u9499\u5316\u7ed3\u8282889\u679a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u80ba\u764c\u7ed3\u8282133\u679a\uff0c\u5c0f\u4e8e5 mm\u7ed3\u8282442\u679a\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u53ca\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u80ba\u764c\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\u7686\u4e3a100%\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u6d4b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u660e\u663e\u9ad8\u4e8e\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\uff0899.1% vs 43%, P<0.001\uff09\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u603b\u4f53\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4f8bCT 4.9\u4e2a\uff0c\u6392\u96645 mm\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7ed3\u8282\u540e\u964d\u4e3a1.5\u4e2a\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba \u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6076\u6027\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u7684\u65e0\u6f0f\u8bca\u68c0\u51fa\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u533b\u5e08\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7ed3\u8282\u68c0\u51fa\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6392\u9664\u5fae\u5c0f\u7ed3\u8282\u540e\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u3002\u2029\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f53\u5c42\u6210\u50cf\uff1b\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\uff1b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff1b\u68c0\u51fa\u3011.", "The availability and generation of large amounts of genomic data has led to the development of a new paradigm in cancer treatment emphasizing a precision approach at the molecular and genomic level. Statistical modeling techniques aimed at leveraging broad scale in vitro, in vivo, and clinical data for precision drug treatment has become an active area of research. As a rapidly developing discipline at the crossroads of medicine, computer science, and mathematics, techniques ranging from accepted to those on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence have been utilized. Given the diversity and complexity of these techniques a systematic understanding of fundamental modeling principles is essential to contextualize influential factors to better understand results and develop new approaches.\nUsing data available from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and the NCI60 we explore principle components regression, linear and non-linear support vector regression, and artificial neural networks in combination with different implementations of correlation\u00a0based feature selection (CBF) on the prediction of drug response for several cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.\nOur results indicate that the regression method and features used have marginal effects on Spearman correlation between the predicted and measured values as well as prediction error. Detailed analysis of these results reveal that the bulk relationship between tissue of origin and drug response is a major driving factor in model performance.\nThese results display one of the challenges in building predictive models for drug response in pan-cancer models. Mainly, that bulk genotypic traits where the signal to noise ratio is high is the dominant behavior captured in these models. This suggests that improved techniques of feature selection that can discriminate individual cell response from histotype response will yield more successful pan-cancer models.", "At the dawn of the new century, Robert Plomin was gloomy. As he recounts in Blueprint: How DNA Makes Us Who We Are, attempts to find the DNA responsible for the heritability of behavior failed. Month after month, journals would report new findings of specific genes for behavioral phenotypes, but they never replicated. One amazing genomic methodology after another was developed in biological genetics and applied to medicine, where it succeeded, and then to human behavior, where it failed. This was the moment of Plomin's despair. He had, with great intellectual courage, staked his reputation on the existence of actionable scientific knowledge of the DNA-based genesis of twin-based heritability. But Blueprint is hardly the product of a gloomy author. Quite the opposite: it is a declaration of victory of nature over nurture, a celebration of the vindication of Plomin as a scientist and of behavior genetics as a field of study. What happened between 2000 and 2019 to brighten Plomin's outlook so radically? Were the genes for schizophrenia and intelligence finally discovered? Are we at last on our way to understanding why, at a biological level, all differences in human behavior are substantially heritable? Alas, no. What happened is that Robert Plomin gave up on the search for individual genes that explain heritability and decided to be satisfied with much less.", "The aim of this study was to verify improved, ensemble-based strategy for inferencing with use of our solution for quantitative assessment of tendons and ligaments healing process and to show possible applications of the method.\nWe chose the problem of the Achilles tendon rupture as an example representing a group of common sport traumas. We derived our dataset from 90 individuals and divided it into two subsets: healthy individuals and patients with complete Achilles tendon ruptures. We computed approx. 160 000 2D axial cross-sections from 3D MRI studies and preprocessed them to create a suitable input for artificial intelligence methods. Finally, we compared different training methods for chosen approaches for quantitative assessment of tendon tissue healing with the use of statistical analysis.\nWe showed improvement in inferencing with use of the ensemble technique that results from achieving comparable accuracy of 99% for our previously published method trained on 500 000 samples and for the new ensemble technique trained on 160 000 samples. We also showed real-life applications of our approach that address several clinical problems: (1) automatic classification of healthy and injured tendons, (2) assessment of the healing process, (3) a pathologic tissue localization.\nThe presented method enables acquiring comparable accuracy with less training samples. The applications of the method presented in the paper as case studies can facilitate evaluation of the healing process and comparing with previous examination of the same patient as well as with other patients. This approach might be probably transferred to other musculoskeletal tissues and joints.", "Research synthesis on simple yet general hypotheses and ideas is challenging in scientific disciplines studying highly context-dependent systems such as medical, social, and biological sciences. This study shows that machine learning, equation-free statistical modeling of artificial intelligence, is a promising synthesis tool for discovering novel patterns and the source of controversy in a general hypothesis. We apply a decision tree algorithm, assuming that evidence from various contexts can be adequately integrated in a hierarchically nested structure. As a case study, we analyzed 163 articles that studied a prominent hypothesis in invasion biology, the enemy release hypothesis. We explored if any of the nine attributes that classify each study can differentiate conclusions as classification problem. Results corroborated that machine learning can be useful for research synthesis, as the algorithm could detect patterns that had been already focused in previous narrative reviews. Compared with the previous synthesis study that assessed the same evidence collection based on experts' judgement, the algorithm has newly proposed that the studies focusing on Asian regions mostly supported the hypothesis, suggesting that more detailed investigations in these regions can enhance our understanding of the hypothesis. We suggest that machine learning algorithms can be a promising synthesis tool especially where studies (a) reformulate a general hypothesis from different perspectives, (b) use different methods or variables, or (c) report insufficient information for conducting meta-analyses.", "Ras proteins play a pivotal role as oncogenes by participating in diverse signaling events, including those linked to cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. Using experimental fitness data and implementing artificial intelligence and a computational mutagenesis technique, we developed models that reliably predict fitness for all single residue mutants of H-ras proto-oncogene protein p21. The computational mutagenesis generated a feature vector of protein structural changes for each variant, and these data correlated well with fitness. Random forest classification and tree regression machine learning algorithms were implemented for training predictive models. Cross-validations were used to evaluate model performance, and control experiments were performed to assess statistical significance. Classification models revealed a balanced accuracy rate as high as 82%, with a Matthew's correlation of 0.63, and an area under ROC curve of 0.90. Similarly, regression models displayed Pearson's correlation reaching 0.79. On the other hand, control data sets led to performance values consistent with random guessing. Comparisons with several related state-of-the-art methods reflected favorably on our trained models. This H-Ras proof-of-principle study suggests a complementary approach for understanding mechanisms with which other proteins are involved in oncogenesis, including related Ras isoforms, and for providing useful insights into designing future diagnostic and treatment modalities.", "Creative thinking drives progress not only in the arts but also, and perhaps especially, in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and it is expected to become even more valuable than technical skill as artificial intelligence outpaces human cognition. Fostering creative thinkers has become a primary focus of educators. Educationally relevant anxieties, like math anxiety, have been shown to substantially impact specific forms of achievement and engagement, both in school and in career pursuits. Identifying these anxieties has led to promising interventions to enable affected individuals to reach their potential. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the possibility of anxiety specific to creative thinking is, to our knowledge, unexplored. In this article, across multiple samples, we tested the viability of creativity anxiety as a construct. We first created a new measure, the Creativity Anxiety Scale (CAS), demonstrating validity, internal reliability, and specificity. Applying the CAS revealed that creativity-specific anxiety predicted individual differences in creative achievement and attitudes toward creativity over and above effects of general anxiety. Moreover, across diverse content domains, from science to arts, anxiety was greater for situations that required creativity than similar situations that did not. Notably, this effect was especially pronounced in women. These findings suggest that creativity anxiety may have wide-reaching impacts and distinguish creativity anxiety from anxiety about noncreative aspects of performance. Establishing creativity anxiety as a novel construct, and the CAS as a valid measurement instrument, opens a new avenue of research that promises to deepen basic understanding of creative cognition and inform development of interventions to enable greater achievement of creative potential. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).", "The development of high-throughput, data-intensive biomedical research assays and technologies has created a need for researchers to develop strategies for analyzing, integrating, and interpreting the massive amounts of data they generate. Although a wide variety of statistical methods have been designed to accommodate 'big data,' \u00a0experiences with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques suggest that they might be particularly appropriate. In addition,\u00a0\u00a0the\u00a0results of the application of\u00a0these assays\u00a0reveal a great\u00a0heterogeneity in the pathophysiologic\u00a0factors and processes that contribute to disease,\u00a0suggesting that there is a need to tailor, or 'personalize,' medicines to the nuanced and often unique features possessed by individual patients. Given how important data-intensive assays are to revealing appropriate intervention targets and strategies for \u00a0treating an individual with a disease, AI can play an important role in the development of personalized medicines. We describe many areas where AI can play such\u00a0a role and argue that AI's ability to advance personalized medicine will depend critically on not\u00a0only\u00a0the refinement of relevant assays, but also on\u00a0ways of storing, aggregating, accessing, and ultimately integrating, the data they produce. We also point out the limitations of many AI techniques in developing personalized medicines\u00a0as well as consider areas for further research.", "Socioeconomic factors and nutritional status have been associated with childhood cognitive development. However, previous Malaysian studies had been conducted with small populations and had inconsistent results. Thus, this present study aims to determine the association between socioeconomic and nutritional status with cognitive performance in a nationally representative sample of Malaysian children.\nA total of 2406 Malaysian children aged 5 to 12\u2009years, who had participated in the South East Asian Nutrition Surveys (SEANUTS), were included in this study. Cognitive performance [non-verbal intelligence quotient (IQ)] was measured using Raven's Progressive Matrices, while socioeconomic characteristics were determined using parent-report questionnaires. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using measured weight and height, while BMI-for-age Z-score (BAZ) and height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) were determined using WHO 2007 growth reference.\nOverall, about a third (35.0%) of the children had above average non-verbal IQ (high average: 110-119; superior: \u2265120\u00a0and above), while only 12.2% were categorized as having low/borderline IQ (<\u200980). Children with severe obesity (BAZ >\u00a03SD), children from very low household income families and children whose parents had only up to primary level education had the highest prevalence of low/borderline non-verbal IQ, compared to their non-obese and higher socioeconomic counterparts. Parental lack of education was associated with low/borderline/below average IQ [paternal, OR\u2009=\u20092.38 (95%CI 1.22, 4.62); maternal, OR\u2009=\u20092.64 (95%CI 1.32, 5.30)]. Children from the lowest income group were twice as likely to have low/borderline/below average IQ [OR\u2009=\u20092.01 (95%CI 1.16, 3.49)]. Children with severe obesity were twice as likely to have poor non-verbal IQ than children with normal BMI [OR\u2009=\u20092.28 (95%CI 1.23, 4.24)].\nChildren from disadvantaged backgrounds (that is those from very low income families and those whose parents had primary education or lower) and children with severe obesity are more likely to have poor non-verbal IQ. Further studies to investigate the social and environmental factors linked to cognitive performance will provide deeper insights into the measures that can be taken to improve the cognitive performance of Malaysian children.", "People living in vulnerable environments face a harder set of challenges adapting to their context. Nevertheless, an important number of them adapt successfully. However, which cognitive and socio-affective variables are specifically related to these variations in social adaptation in vulnerable contexts has not been fully understood nor directly addressed. Here we evaluated socio-affective variables (anxious attachment style, internal locus of control, self-esteem and stress) and cognitive variables (fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, working memory, numeracy, probabilistic reasoning and logical reasoning) to explain variations in social adaptation in a sample of 232 adults living in vulnerable contexts (M = 42.3, SD = 14.9, equal amount of men and women). Our results show that an important amount of variance in social adaptation can be explained by socio-affective variables, principally by self-esteem, while cognitive variables also contributed significantly. As far as we know, this is one of the first steps towards understanding the role of cognitive and socio-affective features on social adaptation. In the long run, this area of research could play an important role on the assignation of resources to ease people's integration into society.

This skill set is important to work relationships and professional success. In this cross-sectional, observational study, we investigated EI scores of 4th-year veterinary students, interns, and residents in a teaching hospital, using a psychometric tool with professional population norms. Participants' EI scores were compared with professional norms and between the sample groups. Scores were examined on the basis of demographics and residency program type. Twenty-four 4th-year students and 43 interns and residents completed the survey. Total, composite, and subscale scores for all groups were lower than professional means. We noted no statistically significant differences in EI scores between training levels, but evaluation of effect sizes showed a medium negative effect of higher training levels on Self-Perception Composite, Self-Regard, Emotional Expression, Interpersonal Composite, Flexibility, and Optimism and a medium positive effect of higher training levels on Impulse Control. Medium effects for residency type were found for Stress Tolerance, Flexibility, and Stress Management, with higher scores for residencies with heavy inpatient loads. Medium effects for residency type were found on Flexibility scores, with higher scores for residents in disciplines with a perceived high stress level. We found that baseline EI scores of 4th-year veterinary students, interns, and residents at a teaching hospital were similar to, but uniformly lower than, those of other professionals and did not increase with training level. These results may be used to build on strengths and address weaknesses associated with EI of students and house officers at this institution.", "Artificial intelligence systems have been employed for the development of predictive models that estimate many agricultural processes.\nIn present study, the predictive capabilities of artificial neural networks (ANNs) were evaluated with respect to assessing fruit firmness as a postharvest life index, with determinations made at four stages of storage: 1, 60, 120 and 180\u2009days after harvesting. Single concentrations of nitrogen (N), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) on fruit (D1 ), all of these nutrient concentrations (D2 ), the ratios of the nutrient concentrations alone (D3 ), and a combination of nutrient concentrations and their ratios (D4 ), were considered.\nThe results obtained showed that fruit firmness at 1 and 60\u2009days after harvesting was not influenced by nutrients. However, the ANN model estimated fruit firmness of 120 and 180\u2009days, respectively, for D1 and D3 more accurately than for the D2 and D4 datasets. Application of D3 (nitrogen/calcium ratio) as the input dataset improved predictions of fruit firmness, with a correlation coefficient of 0.85 between the measured and estimated data. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.", "It is recommended to position pollen monitoring stations on rooftop level to assure a large catchment area and to gain data that are representative for a regional scale. Herein, an investigation of the representativeness of pollen concentrations was performed for 20 pollen types in the pollen seasons 2015-2016 in Vienna for rooftop and ground level and was compared with weather data and for the first time with symptom data.\nThe complete data set was analyzed with various statistical methods including Spearmen correlation, ANOVA, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and logistic regression calculation: Odds ratio and Yule's Q values. Computational intelligence methods, namely Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) were employed that are capable of describing similarities and interdependencies in an effective way taking into account the U-matrix as well. The Random Forest algorithm was selected for modeling symptom data.\nThe investigation of the representativeness of pollen concentrations on rooftop and ground level concerns the progress of the season, the peak occurrences and absolute quantities. Most taxa examined showed similar patterns (e.g. Betula), while others showed differences in pollen concentrations exposure on different heights (e.g. the Poaceae family). Maximum temperature, mean temperature and humidity showed the highest influence among the weather parameters and daily pollen concentrations for the majority of taxa in both traps.\nThe rooftop trap was identified as the more adequate one when compared with the local symptom data. Results show that symptom data correlate more with pollen concentrations measured on rooftop than with those measured on ground level.", "Soil-transmitted helminth infections have been found to be associated with child development. The objective was to investigate hemoglobin levels and malnutrition as mediators of the association between Ascaris infection and intelligence quotient (IQ) scores in children.\nWe conducted a longitudinal cohort study in Iquitos, Peru, between September 2011 and July 2016. A total of 1760 children were recruited at 1 year of age and followed up annually to 5 years. We measured Ascaris infection and malnutrition at each study visit, and hemoglobin levels were measured as of age 3. The exposure was defined as the number of detected Ascaris infections between age 1 and 5. We measured IQ scores at age 5 and used Bayesian models to correct exposure misclassification.\nWe included a sample of 781 children in the analysis. In results adjusted for Ascaris misclassification, mean hemoglobin levels mediated the association between Ascaris infection and IQ scores. The natural direct effects (not mediated by hemoglobin) (95% CrI) and natural indirect effects (mediated by hemoglobin) (95% CrI) were compared with no or one infection: -0.9 (-4.6, 2.8) and -4.3 (-6.9, -1.6) for the effect of two infections; -1.4 (-3.8, 1.0) and -1.2 (-2.0, -0.4) for three infections; and -0.4 (-3.2, 2.4) and -2.7 (-4.3, -1.0) for four or five infections.\nOur results are consistent with the hypothesis that hemoglobin levels mediate the association between Ascaris infection and IQ scores. Additional research investigating the effect of including iron supplements in STH control programs is warranted.", "To evaluate the course of neuropsychological impairment, patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls were assessed with a comprehensive test battery at the time of index treatment and after a 5- and 15-year follow-up period. Summary scores for verbal intelligence (VBI), spatial organization, verbal fluency, verbal learning, semantic memory, visual memory, delay/retention rate, short-term memory, visual-motor processing and attention (VSM) and abstraction/flexibility were constructed. Our results show that neurocognitive functioning is impaired already at the onset of schizophrenia and remains stable over the 15-year follow-up period with an improvement in VBI. With regard to the presence of a deficit syndrome, it became apparent that the group with a deficit syndrome showed a deterioration of neurocognitive functions during the follow-up period, most pronounced in VSM. On the other hand, the group without a deficit syndrome showed an improvement in neurocognitive functions at the 15-year follow-up, which exceeded the learning effects of healthy control subjects. Neurocognitive performance at index assessment strongly predicted the performance at the 15-year follow-up. Most likely due to the small sample size, there were only weak associations between treatment with different types of neuroleptics and neurocognitive performance.", "The ability to recognise others' emotions from nonverbal cues (emotion recognition ability, ERA) is measured with performance-based tests and has many positive correlates. Although researchers have long proposed that ERA is related to general mental ability or intelligence, a comprehensive analysis of this relationship is lacking. For instance, it remains unknown whether the magnitude of the association varies by intelligence type, ERA test features, as well as demographic variables. The present meta-analysis examined the relationship between ERA and intelligence based on 471 effect sizes from 133 samples and found a significant mean effect size (controlled for nesting within samples) of r\u2009=\u2009.19. Different intelligence types (crystallized, fluid, spatial, memory, information processing speed and efficiency) yielded similar effect sizes, whereas academic achievement measures (e.g. SAT scores) were unrelated to ERA. Effect sizes were higher for ERA tests that simultaneously present facial, vocal, and bodily cues (as compared to tests using static pictures) and for tests with higher reliability and more emotions. Results were unaffected by most study and sample characteristics, but effect size increased with higher mean age of the sample. These findings establish ERA as sensory-cognitive ability that is distinct from, yet related to, intelligence.", "Pathogenesis of many diseases is associated with changes in the collagen spatial structure. Traditionally, the 3D structure of collagen in biological tissues is analyzed using histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, magnetic resonance imaging, and X-radiography. At present, multiphoton microscopy (MPM) is commonly used to study the structure of biological tissues. MPM has a high spatial resolution comparable to histological analysis and can be used for direct visualization of collagen spatial structure. Because of a large volume of data accumulated due to the high spatial resolution of MPM, special analytical methods should be used for identification of informative features in the images and quantitative evaluation of relationship between these features and pathological processes resulting in the destruction of collagen structure. Here, we describe current approaches and achievements in the identification of informative features in the MPM images of collagen in biological tissues, as well as the development on this basis of algorithms for computer-aided classification of collagen structures using machine learning as a type of artificial intelligence methods.", "In the last decades, the amount of medical imaging studies and associated metadata has been rapidly increasing. Despite being mostly used for supporting medical diagnosis and treatment, many recent initiatives claim the use of medical imaging studies in clinical research scenarios but also to improve the business practices of medical institutions. However, the continuous production of medical imaging studies coupled with the tremendous amount of associated data, makes the real-time analysis of medical imaging repositories difficult using conventional tools and methodologies. Those archives contain not only the image data itself but also a wide range of valuable metadata describing all the stakeholders involved in the examination. The exploration of such technologies will increase the efficiency and quality of medical practice. In major centers, it represents a big data scenario where Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Analytics (DA) are rare and implemented through data warehousing approaches. This article proposes an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) framework for medical imaging repositories able to feed, in real-time, a developed BI (Business Intelligence) application. The solution was designed to provide the necessary environment for leading research on top of live institutional repositories without requesting the creation of a data warehouse. It features an extensible dashboard with customizable charts and reports, with an intuitive web-based interface that empowers the usage of novel data mining techniques, namely, a variety of data cleansing tools, filters, and clustering functions. Therefore, the user is not required to master the programming skills commonly needed for data analysts and scientists, such as Python and R.", "People use their personal intelligence (PI) to understand personality in themselves and others. In Studies 1 and 2 (Ns = 961 and 548), individuals completed the Test of Personal Intelligence, Version 5 (TOPI 5), which is introduced here. The TOPI 5 is an ability assessment with a broader range of content and more challenging items than earlier test versions. In past research, factor analyses indicated that people employ two distinct but highly correlated abilities to problem-solve in this area. These two-factor models, however, exhibited instabilities and limited applicability between the TOPI 4 and 5 in this research (and as reported in the Supplementary Materials). In Study 3, we successfully test the one-factor models of the TOPI with the present data and archival data sets (Narchival = 19,627). We then use the one-factor models to develop a pair of new test forms: one that is compatible with all the TOPI test versions and another, TOPI 5E, that is better at distinguishing among people scoring in the higher range of performance relative to previous measures.", "Research indicates that implicit theories of intelligence, specifically growth mindset, are conducive to students' academic achievement and engagement. While much research has focused on the role of teachers and parents, it is unclear how implicit theories of intelligence operate in the peer context.\nThis study examined the effects of peers' mindsets on students' learning outcomes. We predicted that participants surrounded by peers endorsing a growth mindset would show increased learning outcomes; in contrast, such outcomes would be dampened for individuals in a fixed mindset peer context. We also expected that perceptions of peers' competence would serve as a mechanism underlying the effects of growth mindset.\nA total of 134 undergraduate students (88 females) participated in the study. Students were of diverse ethnic background.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions where they interacted with trained confederates who endorsed either a growth or fixed mindset viewpoint. Confederates were trained to include specific phrases regarding the nature of ability in a conversation they had with the participants. Participants subsequently completed a problem-solving task and a survey.\nParticipants who interacted with peers endorsing a growth (vs. fixed) mindset viewpoint showed increased task value on the problem-solving task. Perceptions of peers' competence mediated the relationship between a growth mindset peer context and participants' task value.\nFindings provide preliminary evidence that peer mindsets can influence individuals' valuing of a task. As such, peers may be an important resource to be considered when designing growth mindset interventions.", "The demand for total hip arthroplasty (THA) is rising. In the face of rapidly increasing health care costs, ensuring widespread, cost-effective rehabilitation is a priority. Technologies allowing independent home-based rehabilitation may be the key to facilitate access, improve effectiveness, and lower costs of care.\nThe aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a novel artificial intelligence-powered digital biofeedback system following THA and compare the clinical outcomes against supervised conventional rehabilitation.\nThis was a single-center, parallel-group pilot study, with an 8-week intervention program. Patients were assessed at baseline, during the program (at 4 and 8 weeks), and 3 and 6 months after surgery. The primary outcome was the Timed Up and Go (TUG) score and secondary outcomes were the Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scale (HOOS; a patient-reported outcome) and hip range of motion (ROM).\nA total of 66 patients were included: 35 digital physiotherapy (PT) versus 31 conventional. There were no differences at baseline between groups except for lower HOOS quality of life (QoL) subscale scores in the digital PT group. Clinically relevant improvements were noted in both groups at all time points. The digital PT group showed a retention rate of 86% (30/35). Per-protocol analysis revealed a superiority of the digital PT group for all outcome measures. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed the superiority of the digital PT group at all time points for TUG (change between baseline and 4 and 8 weeks: P<.001; change between baseline and 3 and 6 months: P=.001 and P=.005, respectively), with a difference between median changes of -4.79 seconds (95% CI -7.24 to -1.71) at 6 months post-THA. Between baseline and month 6, results were also superior in the digital PT group for the HOOS sports and QoL subscales and all ROM except for standing flexion.\nThis study demonstrates this novel solution holds promise in rehabilitation after THA, ensuring better clinical outcomes than conventional rehabilitation while reducing dependence on human resources.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03045549; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03045549.", "Prospective studies indicate that the exposure to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) during fetal life, infancy, and early childhood may be associated with features of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. However, few studies have investigated the concentrations of serum OCPs in children with categorically diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the concentrations and detection rates of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolites, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers, cyclodienes, and methoxychlor in serum samples of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and specific learning disorder (SLD), all of normal intelligence, compared to typically developing controls (TD). In total, 114 schoolchildren, aged 6-13\u00a0years old, were assessed and distributed into four groups: ASD (n\u2009=\u200939), ADHD (n\u2009=\u200921), SLD (n\u2009=\u200932), and TD (n\u2009=\u200918). Each clinical group was compared to the TD group. Concentrations of serum OCPs were determined by gas chromatography and are presented as ng/g lipid. Concentrations of \u03b2-HCH, the sum of HCH isomers, and o,p'-DDD were significantly higher in ASD children: ASD vs. TD (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD): 10.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7 vs. 6.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0, (p\u2009=\u20090.049); 12.0\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 vs. 6.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0, (p\u2009=\u20090.025); 7.4\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5 vs. 2.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3, (p\u2009=\u20090.0019), respectively. The detection rates of p,p'-DDT, at least one substance from DDTs detected, and the cyclodiene heptachlor epoxide, were significantly lower in the ASD group: ASD vs. TD: 12.8% vs. 38.9%, (p\u2009=\u20090.037); 69.2% vs. 94.4%, (p\u2009=\u20090.044); 10.3% vs. 38.9%, (p\u2009=\u20090.026), respectively. No significant differences between the ADHD or SLD groups and the TD group were observed. We demonstrated higher serum concentrations and lower detection rates of selected OCPs in ASD than TD children. Our results add to potential neurodevelopmental concerns surrounding OCPs and provide evidence of specificity in the relations between HCHs and ASD.", "I analyse an argument according to which medical artificial intelligence (AI) represents a threat to patient autonomy-recently put forward by Rosalind McDougall in the Journal of Medical Ethics The argument takes the case of IBM Watson for Oncology to argue that such technologies risk disregarding the individual values and wishes of patients. I find three problems with this argument: (1) it confuses AI with machine learning; (2) it misses machine learning's potential for personalised medicine through big data; (3) it fails to distinguish between evidence-based advice and decision-making within healthcare. I conclude that how much and which tasks we should delegate to machine learning and other technologies within healthcare and beyond is indeed a crucial question of our time, but in order to answer it, we must be careful in analysing and properly distinguish between the different systems and different delegated tasks.", "The development of behavioral ethics has brought forth a detailed understanding of the processes of moral perception, decision-making and behavior within and beyond organizations and communities. However, prescriptive recommendations of behavioral research regarding how to support an ethical environment often underestimate the specifics of organizational characteristics that may encourage the occurrence and persistence of dishonesty, especially regarding deception as a desired action in some instances by some employees and managers. Furthermore, behavioral research does not adequately recognize the notion that dishonesty can be sometimes viewed as an acceptable cost for some expected traits or skills of an employee such as intelligence or creativity. Under some conditions, deception can be even considered a moral, prosocial activity. Finally, formal ethics systems and situational measures to promote honesty may be inefficient or directly harmful. This article highlights questions of how to assess such factors in research on (un)ethical behavior within organizations.", "Artificial intelligence is creating another new frontier in real-world evidence gathering and analysis. AI's algorithms can approximate-and maybe even surpass-human cognition and judgment in the analysis of complex medical data. Sure, humans will sign off, but AI software will do the heavy lifting.", "To define the role of ERK1/2 signaling in the quiescent endothelium, we induced endothelial Erk2 knockout in adult Erk1-/- mice. This resulted in a rapid onset of hypertension, a decrease in eNOS expression, and an increase in endothelin-1 plasma levels, with all mice dying within 5 wk. Immunostaining and endothelial fate mapping showed a robust increase in TGF\u03b2 signaling leading to widespread endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). Fibrosis affecting the cardiac conduction system was responsible for the universal lethality in these mice. Other findings included renal endotheliosis, loss of fenestrated endothelia in endocrine organs, and hemorrhages. An ensemble computational intelligence strategy, comprising deep learning and probabilistic programing of RNA-seq data, causally linked the loss of ERK1/2 in HUVECs in vitro to activation of TGF\u03b2 signaling, EndMT, suppression of eNOS, and induction of endothelin-1 expression. All in silico predictions were verified in vitro and in vivo. In summary, these data establish the key role played by ERK1/2 signaling in the maintenance of vascular normalcy.", "Radiographic assessment with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used to characterize gliomas, which represent 80% of all primary malignant brain tumors. Unfortunately, glioma biology is marked by heterogeneous angiogenesis, cellular proliferation, cellular invasion, and apoptosis. This translates into varying degrees of enhancement, edema, and necrosis, making reliable imaging assessment challenging. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning artificial intelligence, has gained traction as a method, which has seen effective employment in solving image-based problems, including those in medical imaging. This review seeks to summarize current deep learning applications used in the field of glioma detection and outcome prediction and will focus on (1) pre- and post-operative tumor segmentation, (2) genetic characterization of tissue, and (3) prognostication. We demonstrate that deep learning methods of segmenting, characterizing, grading, and predicting survival in gliomas are promising opportunities that may enhance both research and clinical activities.", "Background: Nursing professionals face a variety of stressful situations daily, where the patients' own stresses and the demands of their family members are the most important sources of such stress. Methods: The main objectives pursued were to describe the relationships of self-efficacy and emotional intelligence with perceived stress in a sample of nursing professionals. We also developed predictive models for each of the components of perceived stress based on the dimensions of emotional intelligence and self-efficacy, for the total sample, as well as samples differentiated by sex. This study sample consisted of 1777 nurses and was conducted using multiple scales: the perceived stress questionnaire, general self-efficacy scale, and the brief emotional intelligence survey for senior citizens. Results: The variables stress management, mood, adaptability, intrapersonal skills, and self-efficacy explained 22.7% of the variance in the harassment-social component, while these same variables explained 28.9% of the variance in the irritability-tension-fatigue dimension. The variables mood, stress management, self-efficacy, intrapersonal, and interpersonal explained 38.6% of the variance in the energy-joy component, of which the last variable offers the most explanatory capacity. Finally, the variables stress management, mood, interpersonal, self-efficacy and intrapersonal skills explained 27.2% of the variance in the fear-anxiety dimension. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that one way to reduce stress in professionals would be to help them improve their emotional intelligence in programs (tailored to consider particularities of either sex) within the framework of nursing, enabling them to develop and acquire more effective stress coping strategies, which would alleviate distress and increase the wellbeing of health professionals.", "The aim of the study was to determine the level of intelligence in people with schizophrenia from childhood and adolescence. It is noteworthy that such studies were not conducted in Georgia. A total of 250 schizophrenic patients under the age of 45 who had the disease started before the age of 18 and who were treated in a psychiatric institution were examined. The study analyzed the obtained data on the level of intelligence from the point of view of age, sex, age of onset of the disease and its type, diagnosis and education. As a result of the study, it was found that a high premorbidal intellectual level contributes to combating the symptoms of the disease, high motivation, less resistance to the conducted drug and other treatment methods, the desire to cooperate with specialists, which helps maintain the level of functioning, including the desire to get an education. No correlation was discovered between the type of disease (negative or positive symptoms) and the IQ (intelligence quotient). To maintain the daily functioning of schizophrenic patients, it is very important to maintain intellectual abilities at the onset of the disease, for which, along with pharmacological treatment, it is necessary to provide cognitive exercises and psychosocial support.", "In this research, we developed a natural language processing (NLP) framework to investigate the opinions on HPV vaccination reflected on Twitter over a 10-year period - 2008-2017. The NLP framework includes sentiment analysis, entity analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based phrase association mining. The sentiment analysis demonstrates the sentiment fluctuation over the past 10\u00a0years. The results show that there are more negative tweets in 2008 to 2011 and 2015 to 2016. The entity extraction and analysis help to identify the organization, geographical location and events entities associated with the negative and positive tweets. The results show that the organization entities such as FDA, CDC and Merck occur in both negative and positive tweets of almost every year, whereas the geographical location entities mentioned in both negative and positive tweets change from year to year. The reason is because of the specific events that happened in those different locations. The objective of the AI-based phrase association mining is to identify the main topics reflected in both negative and positive tweets and detailed tweet content. Through the phrase association mining, we found that the main negative topics on Twitter include \"injuries\", \"deaths\", \"scandal\", \"safety concerns\", and \"adverse/side effects\", whereas the main positive topics include \"cervical cancers\", \"cervical screens\", \"prevents\", and \"vaccination campaigns\". We believe the results of this research can help public health researchers better understand the nature of social media influence on HPV vaccination attitudes and to develop strategies to counter the proliferation of misinformation.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved human-level capabilities and continues to rapidly improve. For the pharmaceutical industry, AI can improve decision-making and transform the quest for better medicines. The keys are investing in data management and in internal AI talent who can create value by leveraging corporate data to tackle crucial business problems.", "Intelligence mindset, which denotes individual beliefs about whether intelligence is fixed versus malleable, shapes academic success, but the neural mechanisms underlying mindset-related differences in learning are unknown. Here, we probe the effects of individual differences in mindset on neural responses to negative feedback after a competence threat manipulation. We hypothesized that when their competence was threatened, participants with fixed mindsets would interpret further negative feedback as punishing. After receiving either no score or a competence-threatening IQ score, participants performed a learning task with feedback that emphasized either the evaluative or informational weight of negative feedback. Participants who experienced the competence threat had the strongest predictive relationships between mindset, performance, and caudate activation. The competence threat may have compounded the subjective punishment of negative feedback for fixed mindsets relative to growth mindsets, causing poorer learning from negative feedback in the evaluative context and inflexible striatal responses to negative feedback across feedback contexts.", "An important component of neuropsychological testing is assessment of premorbid intelligence to estimate a patient's ability independent of neurological impairment. A common test of premorbid IQ-namely, the Reading section of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT)-has been shown to have high measurement error in the high ability range, is unnecessarily long (55 items), and is proprietary. We describe the development of an alternative, nonproprietary, computerized adaptive test for premorbid IQ, the Penn Reading Assessment (PRA-CAT). PRA-CAT items were calibrated using a 1-parameter item response theory model in a large community sample (N = 9,498), Ages 8 to 21, and the resulting parameters were used to simulate computerized adaptive testing sessions. Simulations demonstrated that the PRA-CAT achieves low measurement error (0.25; equivalent to Cronbach's alpha = .94) and acceptable measurement error (0.40; Cronbach's alpha = .84) after only 18 and 6 items, respectively (on average). Correlation of WRAT and PRA-CAT scores with numerous clinical, cognitive, demographic, and neuroimaging criteria suggests that validity of PRA-CAT score interpretation is comparable (and sometimes superior) with the WRAT. The fully functioning PRA-CAT for public use (including item parameter estimates reported here) has been built using the open-source program Concerto, and can be installed by anyone on a local computer or on the \"cloud.\" Given the length and proprietary nature of the WRAT, the PRA-CAT shows promise as a potential alternative (and with minimal or no cost). Further validation in the context of neurological injury is needed.

These photographs were then sent to participants at a university clinic who were English-speaking adult internet users who were masked to the purpose of the study, which asked them to value different social attributes regarding the face in the photograph in a 16-question survey. The study was conducted in September 2018 and the data were analyzed thereafter until March 2019.\nTwelve photographs embedded in a 16-question survey.\nPopulation proportions of responses and \u03c72 test and graphical analysis based on 95% confidence intervals.\nOf 503 respondents (survey provision rate, 100%), 412 (81.9%) were women, 386 (76.7%) were white, 32 (6.4%) were Hispanic or Latinx, 63 (12.5%) were black/African American, 10 (2.0%) were Asian/Pacific Islander, and the median age was 46 years (interquartile range, 32-61 years). The man with ski slope-shaped nose with an NFA of 130\u00b0 and NLA of 97\u00b0 was often associated with frequently perceived positive characteristics; specifically, he was judged to be the most attractive (95% CI, 18%-26%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Participants also often associated superlative youth (95% CI, 15%-24%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), approachability (95% CI, 13%-20%; P\u2009=\u2009.002), and femininity (95% CI, 14%-22%; P\u2009<\u2009.001) with dorsal contours that did not feature a dorsal hump. The man with a dorsal hump-shaped nose with an NFA of 140\u00b0 and NLA of 105\u00b0 was associated by the highest proportion of participants with being the oldest (95% CI, 35%-44%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), least approachable (95% CI, 27%-35%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), least attractive (95% CI, 37%-42%; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and least healthy (95% CI, 26%-34%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Subset analyses also revealed statistically significant dorsal contour preferences by observers' age, gender, and race/ethnicity.\nA reduced dorsal slope combined with more acute NFAs and NLAs was associated with positively perceived social attributes. The results may be of interest to rhinoplasty surgeons and their male patients when planning changes to the nasal dorsal contour.\nNA.", "The artificial intelligence based on medical aid diagnosis has been in full swing in these years. How to better and more safely utilize this new technology to improve the diagnostic efficiency and quality of doctors poses new challenges for our hospital management. This paper aims to explore relevant management problems and corresponding solutions from seven aspects:data security, system integration, technical parameters, risks, workflows and diagnosis results by introducing a new intelligent image screening system. After these management problems have been better solved, we found that the intelligent image screening system can improve the diagnostic efficiency and quality of doctors.", "Retrospective review of prospectively-collected, multicenter adult spinal deformity (ASD) databases.\nTo apply artificial intelligence (AI)-based hierarchical clustering as a step toward a classification scheme that optimizes overall quality, value, and safety for ASD surgery.\nPrior ASD classifications have focused on radiographic parameters associated with patient reported outcomes. Recent work suggests there are many other impactful preoperative data points. However, the ability to segregate patient patterns manually based on hundreds of data points is beyond practical application for surgeons. Unsupervised machine-based clustering of patient types alongside surgical options may simplify analysis of ASD patient types, procedures, and outcomes.\nTwo prospective cohorts were queried for surgical ASD patients with baseline, 1-year, and 2-year SRS-22/Oswestry Disability Index/SF-36v2 data. Two dendrograms were fitted, one with surgical features and one with patient characteristics. Both were built with Ward distances and optimized with the gap method. For each possible n patient cluster by m surgery, normalized 2-year improvement and major complication rates were computed.\nFive hundred-seventy patients were included. Three optimal patient types were identified: young with coronal plane deformity (YC, n\u200a=\u200a195), older with prior spine surgeries (ORev, n\u200a=\u200a157), and older without prior spine surgeries (OPrim, n\u200a=\u200a218). Osteotomy type, instrumentation and interbody fusion were combined to define four surgical clusters. The intersection of patient-based and surgery-based clusters yielded 12 subgroups, with major complication rates ranging from 0% to 51.8% and 2-year normalized improvement ranging from -0.1% for SF36v2 MCS in cluster [1,3] to 100.2% for SRS self-image score in cluster [2,1].\nUnsupervised hierarchical clustering can identify data patterns that may augment preoperative decision-making through construction of a 2-year risk-benefit grid. In addition to creating a novel AI-based ASD classification, pattern identification may facilitate treatment optimization by educating surgeons on which treatment patterns yield optimal improvement with lowest risk.\n4.", "As big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence continue to penetrate into and transform many facets of our lives, we are witnessing the emergence of these powerful technologies within health care. The use and growth of these technologies has been contingent on the availability of reliable and usable data, a particularly robust resource in critical care medicine where continuous monitoring forms a key component of the infrastructure of care. The response to this opportunity has included the development of open databases for research and other purposes; the development of a collaborative form of clinical data science intended to fully leverage these data resources, and the creation of data-driven applications for purposes such as clinical decision support. Most recently, data levels have reached the thresholds required for the development of robust artificial intelligence features for clinical purposes. The systematic capture and analysis of clinical data in both individuals and populations allows us to begin to move toward precision medicine in the intensive care unit (ICU). In this perspective review, we examine the fundamental role of data as we present the current progress that has been made toward an artificial intelligence (AI)-supported, data-driven precision critical care medicine.", "General cognitive ability, sometimes referred to as intelligence, is associated with educational attainment throughout childhood. Most studies that have explored the neural correlates of intelligence in childhood focus on individual brain regions. This analytical approach is designed to identify restricted sets of voxels that overlap across participants. By contrast, we explored the relationship between white matter connectome organization, intelligence, and education. In both a sample of typically-developing children (N\u202f=\u202f63) and a sample of struggling learners (N\u202f=\u202f139), the white matter connectome efficiency was strongly associated with intelligence and educational attainment. Further, intelligence partially mediated the relationship between connectome efficiency and educational attainment. In contrast, a canonical voxel-wise analysis failed to identify any significant relationships. The results emphasize the importance of distributed brain network properties for cognitive or educational ability in childhood. Our findings are interpreted in the context of a developmental theory, which emphasizes the interaction between different subsystems over developmental time.", "Polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) are persistent organic pollutants (POPs), they are considered endocrine disruptors and can bioaccumulate in nature, and in living tissue. Human exposure to and the presence of PBDEs in human samples is of concern due to their potential health risks. Young children are one of the most vulnerable populations to PBDE's potential health effects. Ninety-one serum samples of 6-year-old children, residing in a contaminated location, due to former production of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were analysed to examine children's exposure to PBDEs in Slovakia. Median serum concentrations found for individual PBDE congeners BDE-28+33,\u00a0-47,\u00a0-99,\u00a0-100,\u00a0-153,\u00a0-154 and\u00a0-183 were 0.015, 0.184, 0.079, 0.046, 0.176, 0.014, and 0.097\u202fng\u202fg-1 lipid weight, respectively. Children's preschool maturity was measured using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III) test. In multivariate analyses BDE-153 serum concentrations were significantly inversely associated with WPPSI-III composite score (p\u202f=\u202f0.011, \u03b2\u202f=\u202f-23.6), while adjusting for PCB-153 and sex. Significant negative associations were observed for BDE-153 serum concentrations (p\u202f=\u202f0.002, \u03b2\u202f=\u202f-29.8) and WPPSI-III composite score, after controlling for PCB-118 and sex. Negative associations were also observed for BDE-47, BDE-100 and BDE-153, with different individual WPPSI subtest scores, after adjustment with PCB-153 and/or PCB-118 and sex. Serum concentrations of PCB-153 and PCB-118 were not statistically significantly associated with WPPSI-III composite score and individual subtest scores. These findings demonstrate adverse effects of PBDE serum exposure on preschool maturity of children, and PBDEs potentially negative impact on child neuropsychological development.", "The dental disease is a common disease for a human. Screening and visual diagnosis that are currently performed in clinics possibly cost a lot in various manners. Along with the progress of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence, the internet-based intelligent system have shown great potential in applying home-based healthcare. Therefore, a smart dental health-IoT system based on intelligent hardware, deep learning, and mobile terminal is proposed in this paper, aiming at exploring the feasibility of its application on in-home dental healthcare. Moreover, a smart dental device is designed and developed in this study to perform the image acquisition of teeth. Based on the data set of 12\u00a0600 clinical images collected by the proposed device from 10 private dental clinics, an automatic diagnosis model trained by MASK R-CNN is developed for the detection and classification of 7 different dental diseases including decayed tooth, dental plaque, uorosis, and periodontal disease, with the diagnosis accuracy of them reaching up to 90%, along with high sensitivity and high specificity. Following the one-month test in ten clinics, compared with that last month when the platform was not used, the mean diagnosis time reduces by 37.5% for each patient, helping explain the increase in the number of treated patients by 18.4%. Furthermore, application software (APPs) on mobile terminal for client side and for dentist side are implemented to provide service of pre-examination, consultation, appointment, and evaluation.", "Human language and intelligence go far beyond biological needs, allowing us to discuss abstract ideas, construct imaginary worlds, and do science and mathematics. How did such an ability arise? I propose that a major contributing factor was an arms race between truth and deception in storytelling. In honeybees, an elaborate language could evolve because reproductive conflicts of interest between individuals were reduced. For humans, however, reproductive conflicts of interest became a spur for increasing intelligence. Through the drive to negotiate social interactions, primate intelligence reached the point where knowledge could be shared through basic problem-resolution proto-stories, building on the way animals learn. As soon as honest proto-stories became possible, so did dishonest ones, ushering in an arms race between truth and deception, through which stories, language and skills in detecting lies through contradictions, were driven to ever greater heights. In telling stories to others, humans also told them to themselves, allowing them to think consciously and plan ahead. Through fictions they could share understanding by making discrepancies stronger and more engaging. Science arose when skills in detecting lies through empirical contradictions were applied to stories about how the world operates, whereas mathematics arose when skills in discerning lies through self-contradiction were applied to abstract reasoning. Both scientists and mathematicians used the storytelling structure of problem-chain-resolution to share their findings, founded on the principles of animal learning. Human intelligence thus arose through, and continues to depend upon, a balance between trust and doubt in the stories we share.", "This paper deals with the kinematic modelling of an arm exoskeleton used for human rehabilitation. The biomechanics of the arm was studied and the 9 Degrees of Freedom model was obtained. The particular (optimal) exoskeleton arm configuration is needed, depending on patient abilities and possibility or other users activity.\nThe model of upper arm was obtained by using Denavit-Hartenberg notation. The exoskeleton human arm was modelled in MathWorks package. The multicriteria optimization procedure was formulated to plan the motion of trajectory. In order to find the problem solution, an artificial intelligence method was used.\nThe optimal solutions were found applying a genetic algorithm. Two variants of motion with and the visualization of the change of joints angles were shown. By the use of genetic algorithms, movement trajectory with the Pareto-optimum solutions has been presented as well. Creating a utopia point, it was possible to select only one solution from Pareto-optimum results.\nThe obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach that can be utilized to analyse the kinematics and dynamics of exoskeletons using the dedicated design process. Genetic algorithm solution could be implemented to command actuators, especially in the case of multi-criteria problems. Moreover, the effectiveness of this method should be evaluated in the future by real experiments.", "Trait Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a constellation of emotional self-perceptions and dispositions related to perceiving, understanding, using, and managing emotions of self and others. Although higher trait EI has been implicated in post-secondary success among university students. There is lack of evidence for whether it predicts the pursuit of post-secondary education (PSE) in emerging adulthood. This was the first study to investigate the role of trait EI in PSE pursuit using a large, nationally-representative sample of Canadian young adults who participated in the National Longitudinal Survey for Children and Youth (NLSCY). Participants in this dataset reported on their PSE status at three biennial waves (age 20-21, 22-23, and 24-25), and completed a four-factor self-report scale for trait EI (Emotional Quotient Inventory: Mini) at ages 20-21 and 24-25. Higher trait EI subscale scores were significantly associated with greater likelihood of PSE participation both concurrently, and at 2- and 4-year follow-ups. Overall, these associations were larger for men than women. The finding that these links persisted over a multi-year period is particularly promising, as it represents an important validation step toward further investment in socioemotional competencies as part of youth development interventions.", "There has been a myriad of neuroimaging studies that have suggested that pubertal stages and sex steroid fluctuations contribute to pubertal brain maturation. Investigations on the influence of hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis reactivation and the correlated elevated sex hormones on brain maturation have not unraveled these interactions to date. Here, we aimed to explore the impact of the reactivated HPG axis on spontaneous brain activity changes, by analyzing the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in developing girls aged 8-11 years old.\nThe gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test was used to determine the HPG axis status and categorize subjects into two groups (HPG+ or HPG- group). Intelligence quotient (IQ) and the parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were used to evaluate cognitive and behavioral performance. Two-sample t-tests were used to compare intergroup differences, the relations between brain areas' activities, age and hormonal levels were conducted by Pearson or Spearman correlation analyses.\nCompared with the HPG- group, the HPG+ group showed decreased ALFF values in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) but increased ALFF values in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG). In addition, in the HPG+ group, prolactin (PRL) levels were positively correlated with ALFF values in the right SFG, and there was significant negative correlation between ALFF values in the left STG and CBCL activities scores.\nDue to the cross-sectional design of the present study, further study is needed to determine the relationships between age, reawakening of the HPG axis and related sex hormones and spontaneous brain activity change.\nThese findings suggested that the reactivated HPG axis and elevated PRL level could affect changes in brain activity and this effect may be the neuroendocrine basis of mood, cognition, and social behavior changes in early pubertal girls.", "To determine the prevalence and identify risk factors of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and neurodevelopmental delays in giant omphalocele (GO) survivors.\nThe study cohort consists of 47 GO survivors enrolled in our follow-up program between 07/2004 and 12/2015. All patients underwent assessments at 2\u202fyears of age or older. Outcomes were assessed by either the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (prior 2006) or III (after 2006), or the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (children older than 4\u202fyears). ASD diagnosis was made based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (prior to 2014) or 5 criteria.\nThe prevalence of ASD in GO children is 16 times higher than the general population (P\u202f=\u202f0.0002). ASD patients were more likely to be diagnosed with neurodevelopmental and neurofunctional delays, language disorders, and genetic abnormalities (P\u202f<\u202f0.01). While 53.2% of GO children scored within the average range for all developmental domains, 19.1% scored within the mildly delayed and 27.7% in the severe delayed range in at least one domain. Prolonged respiratory support, pulmonary hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, feeding problems, prolonged hospitalization, abnormal BAER hearing screen, presence of delayed motor coordination, and hypotonicity were associated with delayed scores (P\u202f<\u202f0.05).\nThere is a significant rate of ASD in GO survivors. Neurodevelopmental delays, language delays, and genetic abnormalities were strongly associated with ASD. Neurological impairments were present in nearly half of GO children. Surrogate markers of disease severity were associated with below average neurodevelopmental scores. Level of evidence Level IV.", "This paper presents the translation, adaptation and validation of a broadly used scale to measure emotion regulation strategies (i.e. The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire Children and Adolescents -ERQ-CA; Gullone &amp; Taffe, 2012) in a sample of early adolescents. The 10-item scale was applied to a sample of 248 adolescents (128 boys) aged 13 to 14 years. Semi-confirmatory factor analysis supported the original two-factor structure: Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression (SRMR = .05; RMSEA = .06; CFI = .96). These two factors demonstrate adequate internal consistency and evidence for convergent validity with other scales that refer to emotional intelligence, affect, and behavior. Thus, Cognitive Reappraisal scores were associated with higher self-perceived emotional abilities, positive affect and personal adjustment (ps &lt; .05). Conversely, Expressive Suppression scores were associated with lower self-perceived emotional abilities, positive affect, and personal adjustment (ps &lt; .01), with higher scores on negative affect, school and clinical maladjustment (ps &lt; .01), as well as stress and depression symptoms (ps &lt; .001). Overall, these findings suggest that the questionnaire may be a useful and reliable instrument for the assessment of emotion regulation strategies in early adolescents for future research in Spanish speaking countries.", "Research on the moderating role of trait emotional intelligence (EI) has typically examined this construct in light of other risk factors and their detrimental effects on adolescents' outcomes. This study aims to expand this line of research by focusing on the enhancing effect of trait EI and its moderating effects on the relationship between parental nurturance and adolescents' prosocial behaviour. According to such view, higher trait EI was expected to enhance the positive effect of parental nurturance on adolescents' prosocial behaviour.\nA nationally representative sample of 1850 Canadian adolescents completed self-reported ratings of trait EI and parenting at 10-12 years of age which were related to prosocial behaviour at 14-16 years.\nFindings indicated that, after controlling for previous ratings of prosocial behaviour at age 10-12, child's age and sex, adolescents with high trait EI who were exposed to positive rearing experiences in early adolescence reported higher levels of prosocial behaviour two years later compared to respondents with either low or average scores on trait EI.\nIn line with our prediction, these results confirm the enhancing the effects of trait EI on the relationship between parental nurturance and future development of prosocial behaviour. These findings have important implications in regard to the important role of trait EI in predicting variation of adolescents' prosocial behaviour in response to positive parental influences.", "Artificial intelligence capabilities have, recently, greatly improved. In the past few years, one of the deep learning algorithms, the recurrent neural network (RNN), has shown an outstanding ability in sequence labeling and prediction tasks for sequential data. We built a reliable visual field prediction algorithm using RNN and evaluated its performance in comparison with the conventional pointwise ordinary linear regression (OLR) method. A total of 1,408 eyes were used as a training dataset and another dataset, comprising 281 eyes, was used as a test dataset. Five consecutive visual field tests were provided to the constructed RNN as input and a 6th visual field test was compared with the output of the RNN. The performance of the RNN was compared with that of OLR by predicting the 6th visual field in the test dataset. The overall prediction performance of RNN was significantly better than OLR. The pointwise prediction error of the RNN was significantly smaller than that of the OLR in most areas known to be vulnerable to glaucomatous damage. The RNN was also more robust and reliable regarding worsening in the visual field examination. In clinical practice, the RNN model can therefore assist in decision-making for further treatment of glaucoma.", "Fluid intelligence is the capacity to solve novel problems in the absence of task-specific knowledge and is highly predictive of outcomes like educational attainment and psychopathology. Here, we modeled the neurocognitive architecture of fluid intelligence in two cohorts: the Centre for Attention, Leaning and Memory sample (CALM) (N\u00a0=\u2009551, aged 5-17\u00a0years) and the Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) (N\u00a0=\u2009335, aged 6-17\u00a0years). We used multivariate structural equation modeling to test a preregistered watershed model of fluid intelligence. This model predicts that white matter contributes to intermediate cognitive phenotypes, like working memory and processing speed, which, in turn, contribute to fluid intelligence. We found that this model performed well for both samples and explained large amounts of variance in fluid intelligence (R2CALM\u00a0=\u200951.2%, R2NKI-RS\u2009=\u00a078.3%). The relationship between cognitive abilities and white matter differed with age, showing a dip in strength around ages 7-12\u00a0years. This age effect may reflect a reorganization of the neurocognitive architecture around pre- and early puberty. Overall, these findings highlight that intelligence is part of a complex hierarchical system of partially independent effects.", "To quantify the direct cost of alcohol-related presentations to Royal Perth Hospital ED, as part of the binational Alcohol Harm in Emergency Departments study.\nSecondary analysis of a prospective observational study of all ED presentations over a 168-h period in December 2014. Direct costs for health service usage were based on activity-based costing methodologies from the Royal Perth Hospital Business Intelligence Unit. Patients were classified as either alcohol positive or alcohol negative (using predetermined criteria) to determine the direct cost of these presentations.\nOf the 213 alcohol-positive presentations in the original study, 206 had costing data available. Direct cost of care in the ED for alcohol-positive patients was $121\u2009619 across all age groups during the study week (annual estimate $6.3 million). This cost was largely driven by injuries. On average, the direct cost of care in the ED was $590 per alcohol-positive and $575 per alcohol-negative patient. Costs of care provided in the ED were largely attributable to ED (72%) and radiology (17%) services. Extrapolation using mean costs for the patients without costing data, the study week cost was $144\u2009629, with the annual estimate $7.5 million.\nAlcohol-related presentations to the ED are a significant public health burden. If the study week is representative, the annual cost is substantial. Although the direct mean cost of presentations to the ED is similar between alcohol-positive and alcohol-negative patients, these presentations would not have occurred without the influence of alcohol.", "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to describe key potential areas of application of machine learning in interventional radiology. CONCLUSION. Machine learning, although in the early stages of development within the field of interventional radiology, has great potential to influence key areas such as image analysis, clinical predictive modeling, and trainee education. A proactive approach from current interventional radiologists and trainees is needed to shape future directions for machine learning and artificial intelligence.", "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified >20 genetic loci associated with human intelligence. However, due to correlations between the trait-associated SNPs, only a few of the loci are confirmed to have a true biological effect. In order to distinguish the SNPs that have a causal effect on human intelligence, we must eliminate the noise from the high degree of linkage disequilibrium that persists throughout the genome. In this study, we apply a novel PAINTOR fine-mapping method, which uses a Bayesian approach to determine the SNPs with the highest probability of causality. This technique incorporates the GWAS summary statistics, linkage disequilibrium structure, and functional annotations to compute the posterior probability of causality for all SNPs in the GWAS-associated regions. We found five SNPs (rs6002620, rs41352752, rs6568547, rs138592330, and rs28371699) with a high probability of causality, three of which have posterior probabilities >0.60. The SNP rs6002620 (NDUFA6), which is involved in mitochondrial function, has the highest likelihood of causality. These findings provide important insight into the genetic determinants contributing to human intelligence.", "Precision medicine, imaging first. Radiomics, a method of machine learning in artificial intelligence, provides valuable diagnostic, prognostic or predictive information through quantitative analysis on the tumor's region of interest to support personalized clinical decisions and improve individualized treatment, which could lay a solid foundation for achieving the precision medicine. This review provides a latest advance of the radiomic application of the precision medicine for lung cancer.\n\u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u9898\u76ee\uff1a\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bca\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\uff0c\u5f71\u50cf\u5148\u884c\u3002\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80bf\u7624\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u9884\u540e\u6216\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6539\u5584\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6253\u4e0b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u7efc\u8ff0\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a\u80ba\u80bf\u7624\uff1b\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\uff1b\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\u3011.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained major attention with a rapid increase in the number of published articles, mostly recently. This review provides a general understanding of how AI can or will be useful to the musculoskeletal radiologist. After a brief technical background on AI, machine learning, and deep learning, we illustrate, through examples from the musculoskeletal literature, potential AI applications in the various steps of the radiologist's workflow, from managing the request to communication of results. The implementation of AI solutions does not go without challenges and limitations. These are also discussed, as well as the trends and perspectives.", "The overwhelming majority of the research on the historical impact of IQ in special education has focused on children with cognitive disorders. Far less is known about its role for students with emotional concerns, including Emotional Disturbance (ED). To address this gap, the current study examined IQ trends in ED children who were repeatedly tested on various combinations of the WISC, WISC-R, and WISC-III using a geographically diverse, longitudinal database of special education evaluation records. Findings on test/re-test data revealed that ED children experienced IQ trends that were consistent with previous research on the Flynn effect in the general population. Unlike findings associated with test/re-test data for children diagnosed with cognitive disorders, however, ED re-diagnoses were unaffected by these trends. Specifically, ED children's declining IQ scores when retested on newer norms did not result in changes in their ED diagnosis. The implications of this unexpected finding are discussed within the broader context of intelligence testing and special education policies.", "Virtual reality simulators track all movements and forces of simulated instruments, generating enormous datasets which can be further analyzed with machine learning algorithms. These advancements may increase the understanding, assessment and training of psychomotor performance. Consequently, the application of machine learning techniques to evaluate performance on virtual reality simulators has led to an increase in the volume and complexity of publications which bridge the fields of computer science, medicine, and education. Although all disciplines stand to gain from research in this field, important differences in reporting exist, limiting interdisciplinary communication and knowledge transfer. Thus, our objective was to develop a checklist to provide a general framework when reporting or analyzing studies involving virtual reality surgical simulation and machine learning algorithms. By including a total score as well as clear subsections of the checklist, authors and reviewers can both easily assess the overall quality and specific deficiencies of a manuscript.\nThe Machine Learning to Assess Surgical Expertise (MLASE) checklist was developed to help computer science, medicine, and education researchers ensure quality when producing and reviewing virtual reality manuscripts involving machine learning to assess surgical expertise.\nThis study was carried out at the McGill Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre.\nThe authors applied the checklist to 12 articles using machine learning to assess surgical expertise in virtual reality simulation, obtained through a systematic literature review.\nImportant differences in reporting were found between medical and computer science journals. The medical journals proved stronger in discussion quality and weaker in areas related to study design. The opposite trends were observed in computer science journals.\nThis checklist will aid in narrowing the knowledge divide between computer science, medicine, and education: helping facilitate the burgeoning field of machine learning assisted surgical education.", "Goal-irrelevant information may interfere with ongoing task activities if not controlled properly. Evidence suggests that the ability to control interference is connected mainly to the prefrontal cortex (pFC). However, it remains unclear whether gray matter (GM) volume in prefrontal regions influences individual differences in interference control (IC) and if these relationships are affected by aging. Using cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates over a 4- to 5-year period, we examined the relationship between relative IC scores, obtained from a 2-back working memory task, GM volumes, and performance in different cognitive domains. By identifying individuals with either no or high levels of interference, we demonstrated that participants with superior IC had larger volume of the ventrolateral pFC, regardless of participant demographics. The same pattern was observed both at baseline and follow-up. Cross-sectional estimates further showed that interference increased as a function of age, but interference did not change between baseline and follow-up. Similarly, across-sample associations between IC and pFC volume were found in the cross-sectional data, along with no longitudinal change-change relationships. Moreover, relative IC scores could be linked to composite scores of fluid intelligence, indicating that control of interference may relate to performance in expected cognitive domains. These results provide new evidence that a relative IC score can be related to volume of specific and relevant regions within pFC and that this relationship is not modulated by age. This supports a view that the GM volume in these regions plays a role in resisting interference during a working memory task.", "Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at increased risk of neuropsychological impairments, but few studies are available on the nonlinguistic neuropsychological abilities of children with CHD. We conducted neuropsychological evaluations using the NEPSY II on a cohort of 17 school-age Italian children with diagnoses of Class 1 CHD, no genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, and normal intelligence scores, and we compared them with 34 matched controls. Children with CHD in this study had undergone at least one cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass support. We found that children with CHD scored significantly lower than their matched controls on memory and learning domain tasks, and they displayed subtle attention/executive dysfunctions and deficits in sensorimotor skills.", "Personality and intelligence have a long history in applied psychology, with research dating back more than 100 years. In line, early developments in industrial-organizational psychology were largely founded on the predictive power of personality and intelligence measures vis-\u00e0-vis career-related outcomes. However, despite a wealth of evidence in support of their utility, the concepts, theories, and measures of personality and intelligence are still widely underutilized in organizations, even when these express a commitment to making data-driven decisions about employees and leaders. This paper discusses the value of personality and intelligence to understand individual differences in career potential, and how to increase the adoption of theories and tools for evaluating personality and intelligence in real-world organizational contexts. Although personality and intelligence are distinct constructs, the assessment of career potential is incomplete without both.", "The Openness-Fluid-Crystallized-Intelligence (OFCI) model posits long-term relations between Openness and cognitive abilities and has been successfully tested with longitudinal data. However, research on the developmental interplay between cognitive abilities and personality exists only sparsely. The current paper focuses on a theoretical development of the OFCI model which suggests micro-level mechanisms underlying the long-term development. Specifically, within-situation relations between Openness, interests, situational perception, cognitive abilities, and emotions are proposed to explain longitudinal relations between Openness and cognitive abilities. Using experience sampling, selected parts of this elaboration were empirically scrutinized in a first test of the proposed ideas. Openness and specific interest both varied substantially across situations and covaried systematically. In interaction with an indicator of fluid intelligence, this covariation was related to an indicator of crystallized intelligence. The paper contributes to theorizing the intertwined development of personality and cognitive abilities, and highlights the importance of within-situation research for explaining long-term development.", "A decline in emotion recognition ability across the lifespan has been well documented. However, whether age predicts emotion recognition difficulties after accounting for potentially confounding factors which covary with age remains unclear. Although previous research suggested that age-related decline in emotion recognition ability may be partly a consequence of cognitive (fluid intelligence, processing speed) and affective (e.g., depression) factors, recent theories highlight a potential role for alexithymia (difficulty identifying and describing one's emotions) and interoception (perception of the body's internal state). This study therefore aimed to examine the recognition of anger and disgust across the adult lifespan in a group of 140 20-90-year-olds to see whether an effect of age would remain after controlling for a number of cognitive and affective factors potentially impacted by age. In addition, using an identity recognition control task, the study aimed to determine whether the factors accounting for the effects of age on emotion discrimination also contribute towards generalised face processing difficulties. Results revealed that discrimination of disgust and anger across the lifespan was predicted by processing speed and fluid intelligence, and negatively by depression. No effect of age was found after these factors were accounted for. Importantly, these effects were specific to emotion discrimination; only crystallised intelligence accounted for unique variance in identity discrimination. Contrary to expectations, although interoception and alexithymia were correlated with emotion discrimination abilities, these factors did not explain unique variance after accounting for other variables.", "Clinical significance of a decline in free T4 (FT4) concentrations across the reference range in children with brain tumors treated with radiation therapy (RT) is uncertain.\nTo study trends in FT4 in children after RT and risk factors and health outcomes associated with plasma FT4 concentrations.\nLongitudinal, single-center retrospective cohort study.\nLow-grade glioma or ependymoma patients (n = 267; age \u226425 years) who received RT (50.4 to 59.4 Gy) at a single institution (1996 to 2016) and followed with serial FT4 measurements.\nA linear mixed-effects model with a random intercept was used to investigate risk factors for longitudinal changes in FT4 concentrations. A two-stage mixed-effects model examined associations between clinical outcomes and plasma FT4 concentrations.\nFT4 concentrations declined over time after RT (P < 0.001). Females (P < 0.001) and younger patients (P < 0.001) demonstrated greater declines in FT4 concentrations over time. The rate of weight gain, but not of height loss, increased with a higher FT4 decline rate (P < 0.001). At last follow-up, patients with lower baseline FT4 concentrations had increased risk of glucose disorder (OR, 19.73; P = 0.002) or dyslipidemia (OR, 19.40; P = 0.003) but not high fat mass (P = 0.18). Lower baseline FT4 concentrations were not associated with impaired scores for intelligence, attention, memory, or psychosocial functioning.\nFT4 concentrations significantly decline in children with brain tumor after RT. Variation and trends in FT4 concentration are associated with physical health outcomes. Future studies should assess whether continuous FT4 concentrations and trends, rather than population-based cut-off values, can distinguish between euthyroid and hypothyroid states.", "OBJECTIVE. Although extensive attention has been focused on the enormous potential of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, a major question remains: how should this fundamentally new technology be regulated? The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the pathways developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to regulate the incorporation of AI in medical imaging. CONCLUSION. AI is the new wave of innovation in health care. The technology holds promising applications to revolutionize all aspects of medicine.", "This study proposes a method for classifying three types of resting membrane potential signals obtained as images through diagnostic needle electromyography (EMG) using TensorFlow-Slim and Python to implement an artificial-intelligence-based image recognition scheme.\nWaveform images of an abnormal resting membrane potential generated by diagnostic needle EMG were classified into three types-positive sharp waves (PSW), fibrillations (Fibs), and Others-using the TensorFlow-Slim image classification model library. A total of 4,015 raw waveform data instances were reviewed, with 8,576 waveform images subsequently collected for training. Images were learned repeatedly through a convolutional neural network. Each selected waveform image was classified into one of the aforementioned categories according to the learned results.\nThe classification model, Inception v4, was used to divide waveform images into three categories (accuracy = 93.8%, precision = 99.5%, recall = 90.8%). This was done by applying the pretrained Inception v4 model to a fine-tuning method. The image recognition model was created for training using various types of image-based medical data.\nThe TensorFlow-Slim library can be used to train and recognize image data, such as EMG waveforms, through simple coding rather than by applying TensorFlow. It is expected that a convolutional neural network can be applied to image data such as the waveforms of electrophysiological signals in a body based on this study.", "In December 2014, after a 16-hour siege of the Lindt caf\u00e9 in Sydney, Iranian-born gunman Man Haron Monis shot dead a hostage precipitating the police action which broke the siege.\nThis paper reviews the demographic and other factual details of Monis as documented by the NSW Coroner's Inquest and critically analyses the published findings of the Coroner particularly in relation to the role of the psychiatrist who advised senior police and negotiators during the siege.\nAt the time of the siege, there was no formal protocol that delineated the role of a psychiatrist in hostage negotiations. Despite the psychiatrist's credentials including his extensive experience with siege-hostage incidents and his counter-terrorist training, the Coroner was unfairly critical of the psychiatrist.\nThe Coroner's censure of the psychiatrist was clearly prejudiced by hindsight bias. During the siege, the psychiatrist properly considered and evaluated all the available intelligence and other information known about the gunman. As the psychiatrist advised, Monis was a narcissist and the siege was not an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack. Given that he announced he was armed with a bomb, Monis represented a 'credible threat' to the hostages. The psychiatrist's endorsement of the police strategy to 'contain and negotiate' was prudent in the circumstances. The Coroner's disparagement of the senior psychiatrist may have the unintended consequence that psychiatrists may be reluctant to assist in hostage-sieges or other critical incidents.", "Sarin (CASRN: 107-44-8) is a highly toxic organophosphorus nerve agent that was developed for chemical warfare during World War II and continues to be used in conflicts. Immediate effects of sarin exposure are well known, and although there are suggestions in the literature of neurological effects persisting after the initial signs have subsided, long-term neurological effects of acute exposure to sarin are not well characterized in humans.\nThe National Toxicology Program (NTP), on behalf of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Countermeasures Against Chemical Threats program, conducted a systematic review to evaluate the evidence for long-term neurological effects in humans and nonhuman animals following acute exposure to sarin. (The terms \"animal\" and \"animals\" refer to nonhuman animals.).\nA systematic review protocol was developed and utilized for this evaluation that followed the Office of Health Assessment and Translation approach for conducting literature-based health assessments. Any effect observed 24 hours after exposure (including days to years after exposure) was considered long term for this assessment. Because effects might vary based on time after exposure, the development of hazard conclusions was considered for three different time periods: initial (>24 hours-7 days after exposure), intermediate (8-364 days after exposure), and extended (greater than or equal to 1 year after exposure) periods.\nThe literature search and screening process identified 32 data sets within the 34 human studies and 47 data sets within the 51 animal studies (from 6,837 potentially relevant references) that met the objective and the inclusion criteria. Four main health effect categories of neurological response were identified as having sufficient data to reach hazard conclusions: (1) cholinesterase levels; (2) visual and ocular effects; (3) effects on learning, memory, and intelligence; and (4) morphology and histopathology in nervous system tissues. (This section of the abstract has been abridged.).\nHazard conclusions were considered for the four main health effect categories at all three time periods after exposure. The conclusions with the highest level of evidence for each time period were used to reach the overall conclusions. NTP concludes that acute sarin exposure is known to be a neurological hazard to humans in the initial time period of >24 hours-7 days after exposure based on suppression of cholinesterase. NTP concludes that acute sarin exposure is suspected to be a neurological hazard to humans in the intermediate time period of 8 days-1 year after exposure based on multiple effects, including suppression of cholinesterase, visual and ocular effects, and morphological and histological changes in nervous system tissues. NTP concludes that acute sarin exposure is suspected to be a neurological hazard to humans in the extended time period of greater than or equal to 1 year after exposure based on multiple effects, including effects on learning and memory and morphological and histopathological changes in nervous system tissues.\nThis evaluation identified data gaps that contribute to lower confidence in the bodies of evidence for some endpoints and time periods after exposure. Future targeted research to assess the long-term neurological effects of sarin exposure should address areas with low confidence in the findings. Future research would benefit from the use of well-characterized human exposure data, use of exposed and appropriately matched control populations for neurological tests, and animal models that address the inconsistencies identified in this review using study design, conduct, and reporting practices to minimize bias. Given the hazard conclusions from this review, additional research on the four main health effect categories above may impact the confidence in the conclusions. Research may also be informative on a diverse range of neurological endpoints, identified in this report's appendices, for which there is inadequate evidence to determine whether there is an association with acute sarin exposure. Another area of research that the available data do not address is the effects of sarin on developing and aging brains. The current data are insufficient to assess if there are any susceptible populations.", "Early detection of Mycobacterium leprae is a key strategy for disrupting the transmission chain of leprosy and preventing the potential onset of physical disabilities. Clinical diagnosis is essential, but some of the presented symptoms may go unnoticed, even by specialists. In areas of greater endemicity, serological and molecular tests have been performed and analyzed separately for the follow-up of household contacts, who are at high risk of developing the disease. The accuracy of these tests is still debated, and it is necessary to make them more reliable, especially for the identification of cases of leprosy between contacts. We proposed an integrated analysis of molecular and serological methods using artificial intelligence by the random forest (RF) algorithm to better diagnose and predict new cases of leprosy.\nThe study was developed in Governador Valadares, Brazil, a hyperendemic region for leprosy. A longitudinal study was performed, including new cases diagnosed in 2011 and their respective household contacts, who were followed in 2011, 2012, and 2016. All contacts were diligently evaluated by clinicians from Reference Center for Endemic Diseases (CREDEN-PES) before being classified as asymptomatic. Samples of slit skin smears (SSS) from the earlobe of the patients and household contacts were collected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of 16S rRNA, and peripheral blood samples were collected for ELISA assays to detect LID-1 and ND-O-LID.\nThe statistical analysis of the tests revealed sensitivity for anti-LID-1 (63.2%), anti-ND-O-LID (57.9%), qPCR SSS (36.8%), and smear microscopy (30.2%). However, the use of RF allowed for an expressive increase in sensitivity in the diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy (90.5%) and especially paucibacillary leprosy (70.6%). It is important to report that the specificity was 92.5%.\nThe proposed model using RF allows for the diagnosis of leprosy with high sensitivity and specificity and the early identification of new cases among household contacts.", "Artificial neural networks, as a specific approach towards artificial intelligence (AI), can open up a variety of new perspectives for endoscopy, such as automated lesion detection and the precise prediction of a lesion's histology by its endoscopic appearance. Whilst early experiments do suggest an enormous potential for these methods, public expectations on their application in various fields of medicine sometimes appear to be grounded on general fascination rather than detailed understanding of their inner workings. Based on a selective review of the literature, this article shall convey an intuitive understanding of the underlying methods in order to help close the gap between functioning and fascination and allow for a realistic discussion of their perspectives and limitations in endoscopy.After decades of research, the success of deep neuronal networks in image classification has provoked rising interest for AI during recent years. We quickly touch upon the developments surrounding this breakthrough and the reasons for their impact on various disciplines much beyond computer science. Through a comparison with the functioning of the human vision system, we aim to understand the mechanisms of these techniques and their success in computer vision tasks in detail. Based on these considerations, we analyse the functioning of some important AI applications in endoscopy, deduce specific limitations and perspectives, discuss the current state of their evaluation in practical endoscopy and make a plea for the need for additional and realistic tests. Moreover, we seek to give an impression of some further specific applications that can currently be foreseen and how these can shape the role that AI might finally acquire in the routine clinical practice of GI endoscopy.\nK\u00fcnstliche neuronale Netze als Methoden der k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz (KI) k\u00f6nnen der Endoskopie neue M\u00f6glichkeiten er\u00f6ffnen, etwa im Sinne einer automatischen Polypenerkennung oder der pr\u00e4zisen Vorhersage des histopathologischen Befunds einer L\u00e4sion anhand ihres endoskopischen Bildes.

Darauf aufbauend analysieren wir die Funktionsweise j\u00fcngst demonstrierter Anwendungen in Hinblick auf methodische Perspektiven und Grenzen, die Aussagekraft bisher erbrachter Leistungsnachweise und die Notwendigkeit weiterer Tests. Zudem geben wir einen Eindruck von weiteren, konkret absehbaren Einzelanwendungen und besprechen, welchen Charakter diese dem Einsatz der k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz in der Endoskopie insgesamt geben k\u00f6nnten.", "A considerable part of old people suffer from Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion (CCH) in their long lives but have no way to change. The Modified Dioscorea Pills (MDP), a Chinese compound herbal prescription, has good clinical efficacy for CCH related diseases such as Vascular Dementia, whereas, what happened and how MDP works in CCH need to be clarified. Here, we investigate the neural inflammation and gliosis, neuronal apoptosis and regeneration in an animal model of CCH and interfered with MDP to explore some mechanisms of this Chinese herbal medication.\n40 rats were randomly divided into Sham operated Group, Model Group and MDP Group according to a Random Number Table. CCH models were made by the modified 2-VO (two vessels occlusion) operation. The intelligence of rats were measured by Morris Water Maze (MWM) test; H & E staining and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were applied to observe the pathological and ultrastructural changes in hippocampus; The expression of key genes including growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and key protein including Bax, Bcl-2, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB p65), microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2), Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2(Olig-2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) of hippocampus were detected.\nCCH lead to learning and memorial impairment and MDP can partly restore them; Neural inflammation, Neuronal apoptosis and astrocyte hyperplasia were common in Model Group but they were partly reversed by MDP; The expressions of GAP-43mRAN and VEGF mRNA in Model Group were much higher than those in Sham operated Group, but they reached the highest in MDP Group (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05).\nThrough regulating the expressions of key genes and proteins, MDP partly restore the intrinsic structure of Neurovascular Unit (NVU) in hippocampus, which revealed one of its therapeutic mechanisms on CCH.", "Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been attracted lots of interests over the recent years, due to its applicability across the various domains. In particular, an IoT-based robot with artificial intelligence may be utilized in various fields of surveillance. In this paper, we propose an IoT platform with an intelligent surveillance robot using machine learning in order to overcome the limitations of the existing closed-circuit television (CCTV) which is installed fixed type. The IoT platform with a surveillance robot provides the smart monitoring as a role of active CCTV. The intelligent surveillance robot, which has been built with its own IoT server, and can carry out line tracing and acquire contextual information through the sensors to detect abnormal status in an environment. In addition, photos taken by its camera can be compared with stored images of normal state. If an abnormal status is detected, the manager receives an alarm via a smart phone. For user convenience, the client is provided with an app to control the robot remotely. In the case of image context processing it is useful to apply convolutional neural network (CNN)-based machine learning (ML), which is introduced for the precise detection and recognition of images or patterns, and from which can be expected a high performance of recognition. We designed the CNN model to support contextually-aware services of the IoT platform and to perform experiments for learning accuracy of the designed CNN model using dataset of images acquired from the robot. Experimental results showed that the accuracy of learning is over 0.98, which means that we achieved enhanced learning in image context recognition. The contribution of this paper is not only to implement an IoT platform with active CCTV robot but also to construct a CNN model for image-and-context-aware learning and intelligence enhancement of the proposed IoT platform. The proposed IoT platform, with an intelligent surveillance robot using machine learning, can be used to detect abnormal status in various industrial fields such as factory, smart farms, logistics warehouses, and public places.", "Linking human behavior to resting-state brain function is a central question in systems neuroscience. In particular, the functional timescales at which different types of behavioral factors are encoded remain largely unexplored. The behavioral counterparts of static functional connectivity (FC), at the resolution of several minutes, have been studied but behavioral correlates of dynamic measures of FC at the resolution of a few seconds remain unclear. Here, using resting-state fMRI and 58 phenotypic measures from the Human Connectome Project, we find that dynamic FC captures task-based phenotypes (e.g., processing speed or fluid intelligence scores), whereas self-reported measures (e.g., loneliness or life satisfaction) are equally well explained by static and dynamic FC. Furthermore, behaviorally relevant dynamic FC emerges from the interconnections across all resting-state networks, rather than within or between pairs of networks. Our findings shed new light on the timescales of cognitive processes involved in distinct facets of behavior.", "The human cerebral cortex is highly convoluted as convex gyri and concave sulci. In the past decades, extensive studies have consistently revealed substantial differences between gyri and sulci in terms of genetics, anatomy, morphology, axonal fiber connections, and function. Although interesting findings have been reported to date to elucidate the functional difference between gyri and sulci, the temporal variability of functional activity, which could explain individual differences in learning and higher-order cognitive functions, and as well as differences in gyri and sulci, remains to be explored. The present study explored the temporal variability of cortical gyral-sulcal resting state functional activity and its association with fluid intelligence measures on the Human Connectome Project dataset. We found that the temporal variance of resting state fMRI BOLD signal was significantly larger in gyri than in sulci. We also found that the temporal variability of certain regions including middle frontal cortex, inferior parietal lobe and visual cortex was positively associated with fluid intelligence. Moreover, those regions were predominately located in gyri rather than in sulci. This study reports initial evidence for temporal variability difference of functional activity between gyri and sulci, and its association with fluid intelligence measures, and thus provides novel insights to understand the mechanism and functional relevance of gyri and sulci.", "In a prior issue of the Journal of Intelligence, I argued that the most important scientific issue in intelligence research was to identify specific abilities with validity beyond g (i.e., variance common to mental tests) (Coyle, T.R. Predictive validity of non-g residuals of tests: More than g. Journal of Intelligence 2014, 2, 21-25.). In this Special Issue, I review my research on specific abilities related to non-g factors. The non-g factors include specific math and verbal abilities based on standardized tests (SAT, ACT, PSAT, Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery). I focus on two non-g factors: (a) non-g residuals, obtained after removing g from tests, and (b) ability tilt, defined as within-subject differences between math and verbal scores, yielding math tilt (math > verbal) and verbal tilt (verbal > math). In general, math residuals and tilt positively predict STEM criteria (college majors, jobs, GPAs) and negatively predict humanities criteria, whereas verbal residuals and tilt show the opposite pattern. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research, with a focus on theories of non-g factors (e.g., investment theories, Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns, Cognitive Differentiation-Integration Effort Model) and a magnification model of non-g factors.", "The relationship between the topological characteristics of the white matter (WM) network have been shown to be related to neural development, intelligence, and various diseases; however, few studies have been conducted to explore the relationship between topological characteristics of the WM network and cerebral metabolism. In a recent study we investigated the relationship between WM network topological and metabolic metrics of the cerebral parenchyma in healthy volunteers using the newly developed T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging (TRUST) magnetic resonance imaging technique and graph theory approaches. Ninety-six healthy adults (25.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.8 years of age) were recruited as volunteers in the current study. The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction, and the global topological metrics of the WM network (global efficiency [Eglob], local efficiency, and small-worldliness) were assessed. A stepwise multiple linear regression model was estimated. CMRO2 was entered as the dependent variable. The topological and demographic parameters (age, gender, FIQ, SBP, gray matter volume, and WM volume) were entered as independent variables in the model. The final performing models were comprised of predictors of Eglob, FIQ, and age (adjusted R2 values were 0.489 [L-AAL] and 0.424 [H-1024]). Our study initially revealed a relationship between Eglob and cerebral oxygen metabolism in healthy young adults.", "The bifactor model is a widely applied model to analyze general and specific abilities. Extensions of bifactor models additionally include criterion variables. In such extended bifactor models, the general and specific factors can be correlated with criterion variables. Moreover, the influence of general and specific factors on criterion variables can be scrutinized in latent multiple regression models that are built on bifactor measurement models. This study employs an extended bifactor model to predict mathematics and English grades by three facets of intelligence (number series, verbal analogies, and unfolding). We show that, if the observed variables do not differ in their loadings, extended bifactor models are not identified and not applicable. Moreover, we reveal that standard errors of regression weights in extended bifactor models can be very large and, thus, lead to invalid conclusions. A formal proof of the nonidentification is presented. Subsequently, we suggest alternative approaches for predicting criterion variables by general and specific factors. In particular, we illustrate how (1) composite ability factors can be defined in extended first-order factor models and (2) how bifactor(S-1) models can be applied. The differences between first-order factor models and bifactor(S-1) models for predicting criterion variables are discussed in detail and illustrated with the empirical example.", "The first law providing for the permanent, involuntary institutionalization of \"feeble-minded\" individuals was passed in Illinois in 1915. This bill represented the first eugenic commitment law in the United States. Focusing on the consequences of this 1915 commitment law within the context of intelligence testing, eugenics, and the progressive movement, this paper will argue that the then newly devised Binet-Simon intelligence test facilitated the definition and classification of feeble-mindedness that validated feeble-mindedness theory, enabled the state to legitimize the eugenic diagnosis and institutionalization of feeble-minded individuals, and especially empowered psychologists to carve out a niche for themselves in the courtroom as \"experts\" when testifying as to the feeble-mindedness of individuals.", "Despite the collaborative nature of medicine, most medical professionals are not taught or trained to lead collaboratively. Even when leadership skills and content are incorporated into the curriculum, rarely is the content focused on relationship management and trust, both of which are imperative to collaborative and team leadership in medicine. Resonant leadership is a leadership framework centered on emotional and social intelligence. Emotional intelligence, a concept involving skills that can be taught and improved, has proven to be important in leadership. Resonant leaders, or leaders with social and emotional intelligence, develop positive relationships and environments, engaging team members to work toward a common goal through mindfulness, hope, and compassion. This article examines the current state of leadership education and development and proposes resonant leadership as a viable framework for education. A leadership framework heavy on emotional and social intelligence is ideal for the team environment of medicine, and there is literature to back up the positive outcomes of leading with this framework in a clinical setting, including reduction of burnout, building team trust, and better relationship management.", "The use of artificial intelligence will transform clinical practice over the next decade and the early impact of this will likely be the integration of image analysis and machine learning into routine histopathology. In the UK and around the world, a digital revolution is transforming the reporting practice of diagnostic histopathology and this has sparked a proliferation of image analysis software tools. While this is an exciting development that could discover novel predictive clinical information and potentially address international pathology workforce shortages, there is a clear need for a robust and evidence-based framework in which to develop these new tools in a collaborative manner that meets regulatory approval. With these issues in mind, the NCRI Cellular Molecular Pathology (CM-Path) initiative and the British In Vitro Diagnostics Association (BIVDA) have set out a roadmap to help academia, industry, and clinicians develop new software tools to the point of approved clinical use. \u00a9 2019 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the intercultural intelligence of the university personnel in interacting with students.\nThis cross-sectional study was a correlational research conducted on 136 employees in Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The participants were selected by randomized clustered sampling. The data on intercultural intelligence were collected using Earley and Ang's Questionnaire and were analyzed in SPSS using descriptive and inferential statistics.\nMean score of intercultural intelligence in the education-research staff, secretarial staff, and student-cultural staff was 41 \u00b1 9, 35.6 \u00b1 8.3, and 44.2 \u00b1 7.7, respectively. ANOVA showed a significant difference in the overall scores of intercultural intelligence across the three groups (P = 0.001); the scores of subsections were also statistically different, the student-cultural staff showing higher intelligence scores than the other groups. Furthermore, the overall intercultural intelligence scores varied significantly across the participants' educational levels so that the score of the staff with bachelor's degree was 37.8 \u00b1 8.7 and those with master's degree was 45 \u00b1 7.8 (P = 001), especially in their metacognitive and cognitive subsection scores.\nThe scores of intercultural intelligence were moderate to low in the staff of different working sections of the university. Moreover, the level of education shows impacts on intercultural encounters in this academic setting. The results highlight the need to develop programs in order to raise intercultural understanding in staff.", "Phenotype information is crucial for the interpretation of genomic variants. So far it has only been accessible for bioinformatics workflows after encoding into clinical terms by expert dysmorphologists.\nHere, we introduce an approach driven by artificial intelligence that uses portrait photographs for the interpretation of clinical exome data. We measured the value added by computer-assisted image analysis to the diagnostic yield on a cohort consisting of 679 individuals with 105 different monogenic disorders. For each case in the cohort we compiled frontal photos, clinical features, and the disease-causing variants, and simulated multiple exomes of different ethnic backgrounds.\nThe additional use of similarity scores from computer-assisted analysis of frontal photos improved the top 1 accuracy rate by more than 20-89% and the top 10 accuracy rate by more than 5-99% for the disease-causing gene.\nImage analysis by deep-learning algorithms can be used to quantify the phenotypic similarity (PP4 criterion of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines) and to advance the performance of bioinformatics pipelines for exome analysis.", "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether OCT topography of the Bowman's layer and artificial intelligence (AI) can result in better diagnosis of forme fruste (FFKC) and clinical keratoconus (KC). Normal (n = 221), FFKC (n = 72) and KC (n = 116) corneas were included. Some of the FFKC and KC patients had the fellow eye (VAE-NT) with normal topography (n = 30). The Scheimpflug and OCT scans of the cornea were analyzed. The curvature and surface aberrations (ray tracing) of the anterior corneal surface [air-epithelium (A-E) interface in OCT] and epithelium-Bowman's layer (E-B) interface (in OCT only) were calculated. Four random forest models were constructed: (1) Scheimpflug only; (2) OCT A-E only; (3) OCT E-B only; (4) OCT A-E and E-B combined. For normal eyes, both Scheimpflug and OCT (A-E and E-B combined) performed equally in identifying these eyes (P = .23). However, OCT A-E and E-B showed that most VAE-NT eyes were topographically similar to normal eyes and did not warrant a separate classification based on topography alone. For identifying FFKC eyes, OCT A-E and E-B combined performed significantly better than Scheimpflug (P = .006). For KC eyes, both Scheimpflug and OCT performed equally (P = 1.0). Thus, OCT Topography of Bowman's layer significantly improved the detection of FFKC eyes.", "The results of several international studies indicate a high prevalence of language and communication impairments among children who are referred to child psychiatric services. However, these impairments are likely to remain undetected unless language and communication impairments are evaluated during the psychiatric assessment.\nThe aim of the present study is to investigate the specific association between general and specific mental health problems, as expressed by the problem scales of Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teachers Report Form (TRF), and pragmatic skills and pragmatic language impairments (PLI) as defined the Pragmatic Composite of the Child Communication Checklist (CCC-PC).\nChildren aged from 8 to 13 years (n = 73) were recruited in sequence following referral to a child and adolescent psychiatry (CAMHS) outpatient clinic within 12 months. Children with possible or established autism or intellectual disability were excluded. Standardized instruments measuring language, communication and mental health symptoms were distributed to parents and teachers, an intelligence test administered for clinical purposes, and demographic information was included.\nThe parent reports showed PLI among 38% of the children and revealed strong associations with the CBCL scales for emotional problems, thought problems and, especially, social and withdrawal symptoms, which mean more associations to internalized and non-externalized problems. PC-scores were at similar levels and PLI was reported by teachers at similar rates (compared to parent reports) with moderate agreement. Teacher PC-scores showed associations to only one TRF-scale, social problems. The CCC-PC subscale with the strongest associations to mental health symptoms was \u00abUse of Context\u00bb (\u00abSocial Relationships\u00bb do not contribute to the CCC-PC scores).\nThere was a general increase in PC-scores and increased prevalence of PLI in this clinical sample. PC-scores correlated with symptom scores for internalizing and non-externalizing problems scales. The strongest common factors appear to be related to the social aspects of mental health. Pragmatic skills should be considered as a protective factor for mental health rather than investigating pragmatic impairment as a risk or vulnerability factor.", "Precision medicine has a long history dating to the early 20th century when inquiries into the biochemical basis of large person-to-person variations in susceptibility to human diseases and response to medicines had first begun. Yet, personalized medicine in the 21st century is far from being \"future-proof.\" Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and changing human values and preferences, call for anticipatory, rather than reactive, approaches to the governance of precision medicine futures. In this context, anticipatory governance is an innovative approach to understanding technology and innovation futures. Anticipatory governance and its corollary anticipatory ethics on emerging technologies require interdisciplinary collaboration and communication to cultivate shared language, imagination, and orientation toward plausible sociotechnical innovation trajectories. This study reports, for the first time in the literature to the best of our knowledge, an anticipatory governance experiment on \"implementation precision medicine (IPM)\" using scenario analysis and design fiction. Participants were undergraduate students and experts who collaboratively imagined the plausible futures of precision medicine. Given the long history of the precision medicine field, and recent calls for translating big data to real-life clinical applications, implementation was chosen as a key focus area of precision medicine futures. We report here several plausible future innovation scenarios of interest to precision medicine scientists and engineers and researchers in the fields of emerging technology governance, responsible innovation, and social studies of science. Of importance, we found that the playful quality of the design fiction methodology and the pedagogical orientation facilitated by undergraduate student involvement created an engaging creative safe space to build transdisciplinary dialog examining the social and anticipatory ethics dimensions of IPM. Demonstrating the possibilities of such cross-disciplinary dialog and differential expertise, this article is conceptualized and coauthored by all participants further attesting to the importance of co-designing and co-imagining innovation futures in IPM.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia are neurodevelopmental disorders which show markedly similar deficits in emotion processing, yet treatment evaluation in ASD and treatment comparisons across ASD and schizophrenia are constrained by a lack of empirical work validating a standard emotion processing battery across ASD and schizophrenia. Encouragingly, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotion Intelligence Test, version 2.0 (MSCEIT (Mayer et\u00a0al., 2003) spans the range of emotion processing deficits in schizophrenia and ASD. This study therefore aimed to establish MSCEIT's factorial, measurement, and structural invariance in community-residing adults with schizophrenia (N\u202f=\u202f103) and ASD (N\u202f=\u202f113) using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. Consistent with prior studies in normative populations, a two-factor structure comprised of emotional experiencing and emotional reasoning was supported in ASD and schizophrenia. Both groups operationalize MSCEIT measures similarly, with all measures except for Facilitation and Management showing comparability across groups. To our knowledge, this study is not only the first to establish the measurement and structural invariance of a standard emotion perception battery in adults with ASD, it is also the first to establish its comparability across ASD and schizophrenia. Ultimately, these findings underscore MSCEIT's utility for standardizing treatment evaluation of social cognitive outcomes across the autism-schizophrenia spectrum.", "Child cognitive development is influenced by early-life insults and protective factors. To what extent these factors have a long-term legacy on child development and hence fulfillment of cognitive potential is unknown.\nThe aim of this study was to examine the relation between early-life factors (birth to 2 y) and cognitive development at 5 y.\nObservational follow-up visits were made of children at 5 y, previously enrolled in the community-based MAL-ED longitudinal cohort. The burden of enteropathogens, prevalence of illness, complementary diet intake, micronutrient status, and household and maternal factors from birth to 2 y were extensively measured and their relation with the Wechsler Preschool Primary Scales of Intelligence at 5 y was examined through use of linear regression.\nCognitive T-scores from 813 of 1198 (68%) children were examined and 5 variables had significant associations in multivariable models: mean child plasma transferrin receptor concentration (\u03b2: -1.81, 95% CI: -2.75, -0.86), number of years of maternal education (\u03b2: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.45), maternal cognitive reasoning score (\u03b2: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.15), household assets score (\u03b2: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.24, 1.04), and HOME child cleanliness factor (\u03b2: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.05, 1.15). In multivariable models, the mean rate of enteropathogen detections, burden of illness, and complementary food intakes between birth and 2 y were not significantly related to 5-y cognition.\nA nurturing home context in terms of a healthy/clean environment and household wealth, provision of adequate micronutrients, maternal education, and cognitive reasoning have a strong and persistent influence on child cognitive development. Efforts addressing aspects of poverty around micronutrient status, nurturing caregiving, and enabling home environments are likely to have lasting positive impacts on child cognitive development.", "Evidence-based teaching (EBT), such as active learning and formative assessment, benefits student learning but is not present in many college science classrooms. The choices faculty make about how to teach their science courses are influenced by their personal beliefs and motivations, as well as their departmental structures and institutional cultures. With data from 584 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty trained in EBT, we compare which of the following factors most relate to faculty's use of EBT: 1) faculty's personal motivations (e.g., teaching value, confidence, beliefs about intelligence); and 2) their experiences with their institutional teaching environments (e.g., departmental support, student enthusiasm). Faculty's perceived supports in their teaching environments (e.g., having supportive colleagues, being able to access curricular resources) were by far most predictive of their use of EBT. Faculty's personal motivations had little to no relationship when supports were included in these models. The effects were robust, even when controlling for faculty gender, minority status, and teaching experience. Much of the literature has focused on perceived barriers to EBT implementation (e.g., lack of time, constrained teaching space). The current data indicate that a focus on building supports for faculty may have the greatest impact on increasing the presence of EBT in college STEM courses.", "The relative value of specific versus general cognitive abilities for the prediction of practical outcomes has been debated since the inception of modern intelligence theorizing and testing. This editorial introduces a special issue dedicated to exploring this ongoing \"great debate\".

Standardization data from the Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test for Children aged 2-8 (SON-R 2-8) were used. A representative sample composed of 965 children from the Netherlands and 762 children from Germany was examined. Small but significant mean sex differences favoring girls were observed until age four. At ages six and seven, boys achieved similar cognitive development levels to girls regarding all abilities assessed and outperformed girls on the Mosaics subtest measuring visuospatial cognition. Boys also displayed higher variability rates in performance. The distribution of IQ scores, with the overrepresentation of girls scoring above mean and the overrepresentation of boys scoring below mean in early childhood, altered with age towards parity between the sexes. The results suggest that girls tend to mature earlier with respect to cognitive abilities. During the course of development, however, the differences between girls and boys may become negligible.", "We present three studies which investigated the relations between cognition and personality from 7 to 20 years of age. All three studies showed that general cognitive ability and the general factor of personality are significantly related throughout this age span. This relation was expressed in several ways across studies. The first investigated developmental relations between three reasoning domains (inductive, deductive, and scientific) and Eysenck's four personality dimensions in a longitudinal-sequential design where 260 participants received the cognitive tests three times, and the personality test two times, covering the span from 9 to 16 years. It was found that initial social likeability significantly shapes developmental momentum in cognition and vice versa, especially in the 9- to 11-year period. The second study involved 438 participants from 7 to 17 years, tested twice on attention control, working memory, reasoning in different domains, and once by a Big Five Factors inventory. Extending the findings of the first, this study showed that progression in reasoning is affected negatively by conscientiousness and positively by openness, on top of attention control and working memory influences. The third study tested the relations between reasoning in several domains, the ability to evaluate one's own cognitive performance, self-representation about the reasoning, the Big Five, and several aspects of emotional intelligence, from 9 to 20 years of age (N = 247). Network, hierarchical network, and structural equation modeling showed that cognition and personality are mediated by the ability of self-knowing. Emotional intelligence was not an autonomous dimension. All dimensions except emotional intelligence influenced academic performance. A developmental model for mind-personality relations is proposed.", "Historically, physicians have always been viewed as leaders in the healthcare field. Whether they embrace this role, physicians often find themselves in a leadership role, from the clinical setting to an institutional setting. In most cases, this leadership role is taken on without prior training on even the most basic concepts required for effective leadership.\nWe created a combined leadership workshop for both faculty members and residents in training. The topics included an introduction to leadership styles, emotional intelligence, and negotiation skills. The leadership workshop was conducted as an interactive training session for faculty and resident physicians and was embedded during routinely scheduled teaching time for residents.\nWe present survey data from two annual workshops, demonstrating a clear improvement in participants' perceived understanding of leadership skills in the areas of leadership style, emotional intelligence, and negotiation skills. We have found that fairly simple measures may be taken to embed this training into the busy schedules of medical faculty and residents in training and that tapping into local expertise was an effective and efficient approach to this.\nWe believe the results from our experience can help inform other programs about practical approaches to teaching leadership skills.", "Deliberate fires are a very common problem affecting all countries around the world. They create a high sense of insecurity within communities, consuming and straining many resources (human and financial). Yet, despite various attempts, significantly tackling and reducing deliberate fires has remained largely ineffective, mainly due to the case-by-case approach implemented in responding to these incidents. Drawing on the repetitive nature of some types of deliberate fires, it was shown that adopting an intelligence-based approach is promising in tackling and reducing repetitive deliberate fires. This paper presents a two-fold procedure developed to produce intelligence on a dataset of fire events that were either deliberate or unknown in origin. Firstly, through the creation of a relevant dataset (which is a peculiar problem due to the specificities of the event of fire) and secondly through the application of specific analyses. This procedure was implemented on a dataset of fire events collated from a nine-year period in the State of Geneva, Switzerland. Results show that rudimentary data and simple processing can already generate valuable intelligence, often unsuspected until then. These results provide responding agencies with a clearer understanding of the problem, which can also support their decision-making process. This study proposes the basis for the development of an integrated real-time intelligence process. Such a process would allow the systematic and real-time monitoring of fire events in general and deliberate fires in particular by providing an immediate view of the problem, detecting recurrent events and revealing linkages between cases indicating repetitions. In terms of policies and governance, such a study should encourage institutions that deal with fires to collectively reshape their objectives, share data and analyses, and coordinate their actions to reduce harm.", "The study of coping strategies has provided valuable insights about the process of helping cancer patients adapt to their disease. However, new approaches must be explored to increase the knowledge of this adjustment. In this study, we will analyze the relationship between patients' psychological well-being and quality of life and less well-studied constructs such as the belief in a just world (BJW) and emotional intelligence (EI). Sixty-eight cancer patients (35 men, 33 women; mean age 53.5 years; range: 20-86) were asked about their personal and general BJW, EI, Perception of Quality of Life, Anxiety, and Depression. Different multiple regression analyses showed that patients' personal BJW negatively predicted their anxiety (p &lt; .05) and a trend to a better quality of life. In addition, patients with high scores in the Mood Repair subfactor of EI showed better quality of life (p &lt; .05), and those with higher Attention to Feelings exhibited more Anxiety (p &lt; .01) and a trend to more Depression. These results underline the need to take into consideration new factors, such as BJW and EI, in clinical interventions for cancer patients.", "A perfect legal guarantee can ensure China's high-quality socio-economic development. At present, in terms of China's entrepreneurship education (EE), it is necessary to strengthen entrepreneurs' legal consciousness and respect for rules. The research establishes a model for legal-business compound competency (LBCC). It is a pioneering EE mode adapted to characteristics of China's market transition to cultivate interdisciplinary talents who excel at management and administration but also have a command of laws and regulations in EE. By utilizing behavioral event interview (BEI) and Delphi methods, factors affecting LBCC were summarized. Moreover, a questionnaire-based inquiry was conducted using graduates who received law-business interdisciplinary entrepreneurship education (LBIEE) as subjects to collecting data to evaluate the cultivation effect of the EE mode. In the study, a model for LBCC was established from the three perspectives including knowledge, skill, and attitude. Additionally, cultivating competency of law-business interdisciplinary talents (LBITs) shows a significantly positive influence on compensation level and job satisfaction among graduates who have received the EE. The core task of LBIEE is to improve compound competency of students in legal-business to enable students to show entrepreneurial spirit with legal-business intelligence. It is considered an innovation in a mode of education adapted to the transition and development of China's market economy.", "Mozambique has historically been one of the countries with the highest malaria burden in the world. Starting in the 1960s, malaria control efforts were intensified in the southern region of the country, especially in Maputo city and Maputo province, to aid regional initiatives aimed to eliminate malaria in South Africa and eSwatini. Despite significant reductions in malaria prevalence, elimination was never achieved. Following the World Health Organization's renewed vision of a malaria-free-world, and considering the achievements from the past, the Mozambican National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) embarked on the development and implementation of a strategic plan to accelerate from malaria control to malaria elimination in southern Mozambique. An initial partnership, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the La Caixa Foundation, led to the creation of the Mozambican Alliance Towards the Elimination of Malaria (MALTEM) and the Malaria Technical and Advisory Committee (MTAC) to promote national ownership and partner coordination to work towards the goal of malaria elimination in local and cross-border initiatives. Surveillance systems to generate epidemiological and entomological intelligence to inform the malaria control strategies were strengthened, and an impact and feasibility assessment of various interventions aimed to interrupt malaria transmission were conducted in Magude district (Maputo Province) through the \"Magude Project\". The primary aim of this project was to generate evidence to inform malaria elimination strategies for southern Mozambique. The goal of malaria elimination in areas of low transmission intensity is now included in the national malaria strategic plan for 2017-22 and the NMCP and its partners have started to work towards this goal while evidence continues to be generated to move the national elimination agenda forward.", "Cardiovascular computed tomography (CCT) has undergone rapid maturation over the last decade and is now of proven clinical utility in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease, in guiding structural heart disease intervention, and in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease. The next decade will undoubtedly witness further advances in hardware and advanced analytics that will potentially see an increasingly core role for CCT at the center of clinical cardiovascular practice. In coronary artery disease assessment this may be via improved hemodynamic adjudication, and shear stress analysis using computational flow dynamics, more accurate and robust plaque characterization with spectral or photon-counting CT, or advanced quantification of CT data via artificial intelligence, machine learning, and radiomics. In structural heart disease, CCT is already pivotal to procedural planning with adjudication of gradients before and following intervention, whereas in congenital heart disease CCT is already used to support clinical decision making from neonates to adults, often with minimal radiation dose. In both these areas the role of computational flow dynamics, advanced tissue printing, and image modelling has the potential to revolutionize the way these complex conditions are managed, and CCT is likely to become an increasingly critical enabler across the whole advancing field of cardiovascular medicine.", "Math anxiety (MA) is a phobic reaction to math activities, potentially impairing math achievement. Higher frequency of MA in females is explainable by the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The molecular-genetic basis of MA has not been investigated. The COMT Val158Met polymorphism, which affects dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex, has been associated with anxiety manifestations. The valine allele is associated with lower, and the methionine allele with higher, dopamine availability. In the present study, the effects of sex and COMT Val158Met genotypes on MA were investigated: 389 school children aged 7-12 years were assessed for intelligence, numerical estimation, arithmetic achievement and MA and genotyped for COMT Val158Met polymorphism. The Math Anxiety Questionnaire (MAQ) was used to assess the cognitive and affective components of MA. All genotype groups of boys and girls were comparable regarding genotype frequency, age, school grade, numerical estimation, and arithmetic abilities. We compared the results of all possible genetic models: codominance (Val/Val vs. Val/Met vs. Met/Met), heterosis (Val/Met vs. Val/Val plus Met/Met), valine dominance (Val/Val plus Val/Met vs. Met/Met), and methionine dominance (Met/Met plus Val/Met vs. Val/Val). Models were compared using AIC and AIC weights. No significant differences between girls and boys and no effects of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism on numerical estimation and arithmetic achievement were observed. Sex by genotype effects were significant for intelligence and MA. Intelligence scores were higher in Met/Met girls than in girls with at least one valine allele (valine dominance model). The best fitting model for MA was heterosis. In Anxiety Toward Mathematics, heterozygous individuals presented MA levels close to the grand average regardless of sex. Homozygous boys were significantly less and homozygous girls significantly more math anxious. Heterosis has been seldom explored, but in recent years has emerged as the best genetic model for some phenotypes associated with the COMT Val158Met polymorphism. This is the first study to investigate the genetic-molecular basis of MA.", "We provide new estimates on size, composition and distribution of human resource for health in India and compare with the health workers population ratio as recommended by the WHO. We also estimate size of non-health workers engaged in health sector and the size of technically qualified health professionals who are not a part of the health workforce.\nNationally representative cross-section household survey and review of published documents by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence.\nNational.\nHead of household/key informant in a sample of 101 724 households.\nNot applicable.\nThe primary outcome was the number and density of health workers,and the secondary outcome was the percentage of health workers who are technically qualified and the percentage of individuals technically qualified and not in workforce.\nThe total size of health workforce estimated from the National Sample Survey (NSS) data is 3.8\u2009million as of January 2016, which is about 1.2\u2009million less than the total number of health professionals registered with different councils and associations. The density of doctors and nurses and midwives per 10\u2009000 population is 20.6 according to the NSS and 26.7 based on the registry data. Health workforce density in rural India and states in eastern India is lower than the WHO minimum threshold of 22.8 per 10\u2009000 population. More than 80% of doctors and 70% of nurses and midwives are employed in the private sector. Approximately 25% of the currently working health professionals do not have the required qualifications as laid down by professional councils, while 20% of adequately qualified doctors are not in the current workforce.\nDistribution and qualification of health professionals are serious problems in India when compared with the overall size of the health workers. Policy should focus on enhancing the quality of health workers and mainstreaming professionally qualified persons into the health workforce.", "The differential diagnosis of paediatric respiratory conditions is difficult and suboptimal. Existing diagnostic algorithms are associated with significant error rates, resulting in misdiagnoses, inappropriate use of antibiotics and unacceptable morbidity and mortality. Recent advances in acoustic engineering and artificial intelligence have shown promise in the identification of respiratory conditions based on sound analysis, reducing dependence on diagnostic support services and clinical expertise. We present the results of a diagnostic accuracy study for paediatric respiratory disease using an automated cough-sound analyser.\nWe recorded cough sounds in typical clinical environments and the first five coughs were used in analyses. Analyses were performed using cough data and up to five-symptom input derived from patient/parent-reported history. Comparison was made between the automated cough analyser diagnoses and consensus clinical diagnoses reached by a panel of paediatricians after review of hospital charts and all available investigations.\nA total of 585 subjects aged 29\u2009days to 12\u2009years were included for analysis. The Positive Percent and Negative Percent Agreement values between the automated analyser and the clinical reference were as follows: asthma (97, 91%); pneumonia (87, 85%); lower respiratory tract disease (83, 82%); croup (85, 82%); bronchiolitis (84, 81%).\nThe results indicate that this technology has a role as a high-level diagnostic aid in the assessment of common childhood respiratory disorders.\nAustralian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (retrospective) - ACTRN12618001521213 : 11.09.2018.", "Increasing interests have been focused on using artificial intelligence (AI) to extend prognostic value of medical imaging. Feature extraction is a critical step for successful application of AI. The aim of this study was to explore several metabolic parameters measured by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as potential AI features in predicting the effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nA set of metabolic parameters of PET/CT and clinical characteristics were detected from 137 patients with NSCLC treated with at least 1 cycle of chemotherapy. Survival receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to define the more significant parameters chosen for the following survival analysis. Patient survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox regression.\nSurvival ROC showed that maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume 50% (MTV50), and total lesion glycolysis 50% (TLG50) had larger area under the curve, and the optimal cutoff values were 11.72, 4.04, and 34.55, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses synergistically showed that late PET/CT stage and MTV50 >4.04 were independent factors of poor survival in patients with NSCLC who received chemotherapy.\nSeveral potential prognostic biomarkers of PET/CT imaging have been extracted for predicting survival and selecting patients with NSCLC who are more likely to benefit from chemotherapy. The identification may accelerate the development of AI methods to improve treatment outcome for NSCLC.", "Based on a retrospective cohort design with 6-year-old children born in twin births, the relationship between verbal, non-verbal, global neuropsychological development, general intelligence and type of delivery has been studied. To this end, the possible effect of third gestational, obstetric and neonatal variables, such as maternal age at delivery, fetal presentation, gestational age, newborn weight and Apgar at minute one, was controlled. The exposed cohort includes children born by cesarean section, and the unexposed cohort is composed of children born vaginally with or without induction. A total of 124 children were evaluated in their 1st year of primary school using the Child Neuropsychological Maturity Questionnaire, Kaufman's Intelligence Test and the medical histories of the children collected after birth. By means of binary logistic regression analysis, it has been found that the type of delivery is presented as an independent risk factor for disorders in verbal, non-verbal and global development and for the general intellectual difficulties of children born of multiple births. These results suggest the need to analyze in future prospective studies with broader samples the relationship between different types of obstetric and perinatal variables of birth type and infant neuropsychological development and general intelligence, in order to prevent possible psychological alterations from birth.", "Despite treatment, immune activation is thought to contribute to cerebral injury in children perinatally infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We aimed to characterize immune activation in relation to neuroimaging and cognitive outcomes. We therefore measured immunological, coagulation, and neuronal biomarkers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of 34 perinatally HIV-infected children aged 8-18 years, and in plasma samples of 37 controls of comparable age, sex, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. We then compared plasma biomarker levels between groups, and explored associations between plasma/CSF biomarkers and neuroimaging and cognitive outcomes using network analysis. HIV-infected children showed higher plasma levels of C-reactive protein, interferon-gamma, interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 than controls. In HIV-infected participants, plasma soluble CD14 was positively associated with microstructural white matter (WM) damage, and plasma D-dimer was negatively associated with WM blood flow. In CSF, IL-6 was negatively associated with WM volume, and neurofilament heavy-chain (NFH) was negatively associated with intelligence quotient and working memory. These markers of ongoing inflammation, immune activation, coagulation, and neuronal damage could be used to further evaluate the pathophysiology and clinical course of cerebral and cognitive deficits in perinatally acquired HIV.", "The environments in which nursing work is undertaken can be highly stressful and complex with resultant harmful outcomes for the health of both nurses and patients reported. Undergraduate nursing students are particularly challenged when on clinical placement through having only partially developed work capabilities, with wide claims that these nurses remain underprepared for work even upon graduation. Over time undergraduate nursing education has arguably not prioritized developing resilience and other non-technical skills required to respond effectively to these challenges. This paper reports findings from a qualitative study of student nurses who received training and coaching in emotional intelligence, a well-established correlate of resilience, just prior to undertaking a mental health or medical/surgical clinical placement. Of that cohort, 12 agreed to qualitative semi-structured interviews that sought to better understand how these students used the knowledge and capabilities from the training within clinical placement contexts. Four themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the interviews: (1) greater experiences of resilience; (2) responding positively to mental health consumers; (3) experiences of greater empathy and compassion; and (4) experiences of improved non-technical work skills. Implications from these findings suggest that student and patient experiences of nursing placement, and mental health nursing placements in particular, would be enhanced by pre-placement emotional intelligence training and coaching. Such training will support nursing graduates to be work-ready upon entering the workforce.", "Background: Recent evidence suggests that depressed patients experience social cognitive deficits (e.g., poor affect recognition). However, very little is known regarding the contribution of social cognitive deficits to psychosocial dysfunction (e.g., occupational functioning). In particular, the mechanistic roles of depression severity and cognitive deficits (e.g., memory) in this domain have not been explored. The current study evaluated the extent to which mood symptoms and cognitive deficits provide a mechanistic explanation for the relationship between social cognitive and psychosocial deficits in major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: Data were obtained from 111 participants with MDD (75 Female, mean age = 35, 84% Caucasian, 12% Asian, 4% Other) in the Cognitive Function and Mood Study (CoFaM-S), a cross-sectional study of mood, social cognition, cognition, and psychosocial functioning in mood disorders. Social cognitive abilities were assessed using the Social Perception subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and psychosocial dysfunction was clinically evaluated with the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST). Results: Cognitive deficits and mood symptoms did not significantly mediate relationships between social cognitive ability and psychosocial dysfunction. The exception was executive function, which mediated an indirect relationship between meaning interpretation (i.e., theory of mind) and self-perceived cognitive dysfunction. Conclusion: The results suggest that the relationship between social cognitive deficits and psychosocial dysfunction is not mechanistically explained by mood symptoms or nonsocial cognition. Development of treatment strategies targeting social cognitive deficits in patients with MDD is warranted.", "OBJECTIVE. The objective of this article is to show how artificial intelligence (AI) has impacted different components of the imaging value chain thus far as well as to describe its potential future uses. CONCLUSION. The use of AI has the potential to greatly enhance every component of the imaging value chain. From assessing the appropriateness of imaging orders to helping predict patients at risk for fracture, AI can increase the value that musculoskeletal imagers provide to their patients and to referring clinicians by improving image quality, patient centricity, imaging efficiency, and diagnostic accuracy.", "The current study provides a comprehensive analysis of the overlap between trait emotional intelligence (EI) and personality. This overlap was examined using the HEXACO personality framework at both the domain and the facet levels, and through varying methods of deriving a general factor of personality (GFP).\nA sample of 1,370 Australian adults (51% male, age in years M\u00a0=\u00a045.5, SD\u00a0=\u00a011.7, range: 21-71) completed the 200-item HEXACO Personality Inventory-Revised and the Modified Assessing Emotions Scale measure of self-reported Trait EI.\nThe strongest domain correlations with Total EI emerged for Extraversion (r\u00a0=\u00a0.67) followed by Openness (r\u00a0=\u00a0.39), Conscientiousness (r\u00a0=\u00a0.35), and Agreeableness (r\u00a0=\u00a0.26). Large adjusted multiple correlations were obtained when predicting Total EI from HEXACO domains (.74) and facets (.81). The correlations of the GFP and Total EI ranged from .53 to .64 depending on how the GFP was operationalized.\nTrait EI is largely captured by the HEXACO personality framework, whereby Extraversion or the GFP provides a rough initial approximation, but composites of domains and facets provide progressively better representations.", "Recent applications of dynamic network analyses to functional neuroimaging data have revealed relationships between a number of cognition conditions and the dynamic reconfiguration of brain networks. Here we critically review such applications of network neuroscience to intelligence. After providing an overview of network neuroscience, we center our discussion around the recently proposed Network Neuroscience Theory of Intelligence (Barbey, 2017). We evaluate and review existing empirical support for the theses made by this theory and argue that while studies strongly suggest their plausibility, evidence to date has largely been indirect. We propose avenues for future research to directly evaluate these theses by overcoming the methodological and analytical shortcomings of previous studies. In doing so, our goal is to stimulate future empirical investigations and present valuable ways forward in the network neuroscience of intelligence.", "Objectives: Obesity is associated with poorer brain health and cognitive function. However, it is not clear whether specific dietary factors may provide neuroprotective effects among individuals with overweight and obesity. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of choline intake on neurophysiological markers of attentional control among young and middle-aged adults with overweight or obesity.Methods: 146 adults with BMI \u226525\u2005kg/m2 (34.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9 years, 57 males) participated in the study. Behavioral performance (accuracy and reaction time) and neuroelectric indices (event-related brain potentials [ERPs]) of attentional inhibition were assessed during a Flanker task. Specifically, the amplitude and latency of the P3 waveform in a central-parietal region of interest (ROI) were used to index attentional resource allocation and information processing speed, respectively. Choline intake and overall diet quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI-2015]) were assessed using 7-day diet records. Intelligence Quotient was assessed using the Kaufman-Brief Intelligence Test. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between habitual dietary choline intake and cognitive outcomes following adjustment of demographic factors, IQ, HEI-2015, and BMI.Results: Choline intake was selectively associated with a lower peak amplitude of the P300 waveform during incongruent trials (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.25, p\u2009=\u2009<0.01). No significant relationships were observed for accuracy or reaction time.Discussion: Higher choline intake is associated with more efficient neural processing among adults with overweight and obesity. Intervention are necessary to determine whether choline consumption provides neuroprotective effects for executive function among individuals with elevated weight status.", "The construction of smart cities is a theme of urban development, and building fires greatly threaten public safety and urban environmental governance, in which fire emergency management is one of the key factors. However, most studies on the evaluation of emergency response capacity ignore the process of improvement, as well as the intelligence and practicality of the results. The evaluation system of building fire emergency response capability maturity (FE-CMM) was innovatively proposed based on the capability maturity model (CMM), including the evaluation index, evaluation grade, evaluation method, and evaluation process. At the same time, a plug-in for evaluating fire emergency response capability was developed based on the building information modeling (BIM) platform. Finally, an empirical study was carried out in combination with the case of a district fire center. The research demonstrates that the evaluation system can effectively judge the maturity of fire emergency response capability, and the established plug-in can preliminarily realize the intelligent evaluation of building fire emergency response capability, which improves the practice and intelligence of the fire emergency response capability evaluation system when fully considering the process of improvement. It has guiding significance for ex ante control and refined management of building fires, thus providing support for urban public safety and environmental governance.", "The present study aimed to investigate the association between trait emotional intelligence and heart rate variability (HRV) recovery responses of archers immediately after a shooting session. The sample included 87 novice archers ranging in age from 18 to 26. Participants first completed Schutte Emotional Intelligence Inventory. Then, they shot 10 arrows from 18 m to an 80-cm diameter target in four minutes. Afterward, participants' HRV recovery responses were measured during a four-minute recovery period. In this study, HRV was represented in terms of low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and LF/HF ratio. Results indicated a significant relationship between emotional intelligence and HRV recovery responses. A regression model containing emotional intelligence sub-dimensions was able to explain a significant amount of variance in HRV frequency domain parameters. Besides, high emotional intelligence archers were found to have higher-level LF and HF power but a lower LF/HF ratio than their low emotional intelligence counterparts. Taken together, the results observed in the present study indicated that emotional intelligence might give rise to more adaptive HRV recovery responses following a demanding arrow shooting session.", "Structure-based drug design is becoming an essential tool for faster and more cost-efficient lead discovery relative to the traditional method. Genomic, proteomic, and structural studies have provided hundreds of new targets and opportunities for future drug discovery. This situation poses a major problem: the necessity to handle the \"big data\" generated by combinatorial chemistry. Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning play a pivotal role in the analysis and systemization of larger data sets by statistical machine learning methods. Advanced AI-based sophisticated machine learning tools have a significant impact on the drug discovery process including medicinal chemistry. In this review, we focus on the currently available methods and algorithms for structure-based drug design including virtual screening and de novo drug design, with a special emphasis on AI- and deep-learning-based methods used for drug discovery.", "An article's keywords are distinct because they represent what authors feel are the most important words in their papers. Combined, they can even shed light on which research topics in a field are popular (or less so). Here we conducted bibliometric keyword analyses of articles published in the journal, Intelligence (2000-2016). The article set comprised 916 keyword-containing papers. First, we analyzed frequencies to determine which keywords were most/least popular. Second, we analyzed Web of Science (WOS) citation counts for the articles listing each keyword and we ran regression analyses to examine the effect of keyword categories on citation counts. Third, we looked at how citation counts varied across time. For the frequency analysis, \"g factor\", \"psychometrics/statistics\", and \"education\" emerged as the keywords with the highest counts. Conversely, the WOS citation analysis showed that papers with the keywords \"spatial ability\", \"factor analysis\", and \"executive function\" had the highest mean citation values. We offer tentative explanations for the discrepant results across frequencies and citations. The analysis across time revealed several keywords that increased (or decreased) in frequency over 17 years. We end by discussing how bibliometric keyword analysis can detect research trends in the field, both now and in the past.", "Activated sludge, a microbial ecosystem at industrial wastewater treatment plants, is an active collection of diverse gene pool that creates the intelligence required for coexistence at the cost of pollutants. This study has analyzed one such ecosystem from a site treating wastewater pooled from over 200 different industries. The metagenomics approach used could predict the degradative pathways of more than 30 dominating molecules commonly found in wastewater. Results were extended to design a bioremediation strategy using 4-methylphenol, 2-chlorobenzoate, and 4-chlorobenzoate as target compounds. Catabolic potential required to degrade four aromatic families, namely benzoate family, PAH family, phenol family, and PCB family, was mapped. Results demonstrated a network of diverse genera, where a few phylotypes were seen to contain diverse catabolic capacities and were seen to be present in multiple networks. The study highlights the importance of looking more closely at the microbial community of activated sludge to harness its latent potential. Conventionally treated as a black box, the activated biomass does not perform at its full potential. Metagenomics allows a clearer insight into the complex pathways operating at the site and the detailed documentation of genes allows the activated biomass to be used as a bioresource.", "Here we analyze the simultaneous relationships among five variables. Two refer to childhood (episodes of various forms of maltreatment and externalizing behaviors), whereas three refer to early adulthood (intelligence, personality, and socialization difficulties). The 120 individuals considered for the present report were invited from the 650 schoolchildren participating in the Longitudinal Study of Intelligence and Personality (Minas Gerais, Brazil). The complete sample was recruited in 2002 (T1; mean age = 10.0; standard deviation (SD) = 2.2) and 120 were tested again in 2014-17 (T2; mean age = 23.5; SD = 2.2). Externalizing behaviors were registered at T1, whereas the remaining variables were obtained at T2. These were the main results: (1) externalizing behaviors predict future social effectiveness (as estimated by the general factor of personality derived from the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R) and socialization difficulties computed from the socialization scale (SOC)) and future intelligence performance (as assessed by a set of fluid and crystallized tests); (2) episodes of self-reported childhood maltreatment predict social effectiveness, but not intelligence; (3) maltreatment and externalizing behaviors are unrelated; and (4) social effectiveness (personality) and intelligence are unrelated. Therefore, the findings support the dissociation between adult intelligence and personality with respect to maltreatment episodes and externalizing behaviors occurring in childhood. Implications of these findings for social policies aimed at preventing adult socially ineffective personalities are underscored.", "This study explored a longitudinal data set of 4361 adults (2119 males and 2239 females) to examine factors that influence adult vocabulary task performance. Data were collected at birth, in childhood (age 10 years), during teenage years (age 16 years), and in adulthood (ages 30, 34, and 42 years) to examine the effects of family social status, childhood cognitive ability, teenager locus of control, psychological distress, educational qualifications, and occupational prestige in adulthood on an adult vocabulary task-an index of crystallized intelligence. Structural equation modeling showed that childhood cognitive ability, teenager locus of control, education, and occupation were all significant and direct predictors of adult vocabulary task performance. Parental social status affected the outcome variable mediated through educational qualifications. The strongest predictor of adult vocabulary task performance was childhood cognitive ability, followed by educational qualifications and locus of control. Finally, limitations were acknowledged.", "Theory of mind (ToM) can be divided into two constructs: capacity and performance. Although severity of autism traits and verbal comprehension have been identified as being associated with ToM capacity, no study has yet verified their role in predicting the ToM performance of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\nTo examine the differences and associations between ToM capacity and ToM performance and to verify the role of autism traits and verbal comprehension in predicting ToM performance in children with ASD.\nCross-sectional study.\nPediatric rehabilitation hospitals and clinics.\nOne hundred four children with ASD who met the inclusion criteria.\nWe examined ToM capacity and ToM performance with the Theory of Mind Task Battery (ToMTB) and the Theory of Mind Inventory-2-Chinese version (ToMI-2-C). Severity of autism traits and verbal comprehension were assessed with the Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS-2), and the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) of either the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition. We conducted correlation and hierarchical regression analyses.\nScores on the ToMI-2-C were significantly correlated with those on the ToMTB, SRS-2, and VCI (rs = .613, -.344, and .566, respectively; p < .01).\nToM capacity is significantly correlated with ToM performance. Both severity of autism traits and verbal comprehension played an important role in predicting ToM performance of children with ASD after controlling for ToM capacity.\nToM capacity, severity of autism traits, and verbal comprehension were all significant predictors of ToM performance. Improving ToM capacity, severity of autism traits, and verbal comprehension of children with ASD would be beneficial to their ToM performance.", "Individuals living with long-term physical health conditions frequently experience co-occurring mental health problems. This comorbidity has a significant impact on an individual's levels of emotional distress, health outcomes, and associated health care utilization. As health care services struggle to meet demand and care increasingly moves to the community, digital tools are being promoted to support patients to self-manage their health. One such technology is the autonomous virtual agent (chatbot, conversational agent), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to process the user's written or spoken natural language and then to select or construct the corresponding appropriate responses.\nThis study aimed to co-design the content, functionality, and interface modalities of an autonomous virtual agent to support self-management for patients with an exemplar long-term condition (LTC; chronic pulmonary obstructive disease [COPD]) and then to assess the acceptability and system content.\nWe conducted 2 co-design workshops and a proof-of-concept implementation of an autonomous virtual agent with natural language processing capabilities. This implementation formed the basis for video-based scenario testing of acceptability with adults with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals involved in their care.\nAdults (n=6) with a diagnosis of COPD and health professionals (n=5) specified 4 priority self-management scenarios for which they would like to receive support: at the time of diagnosis (information provision), during acute exacerbations (crisis support), during periods of low mood (emotional support), and for general self-management (motivation). From the scenario testing, 12 additional adults with COPD felt the system to be both acceptable and engaging, particularly with regard to internet-of-things capabilities. They felt the system would be particularly useful for individuals living alone.\nPatients did not explicitly separate mental and physical health needs, although the content they developed for the virtual agent had a clear psychological approach. Supported self-management delivered via an autonomous virtual agent was acceptable to the participants. A co-design process has allowed the research team to identify key design principles, content, and functionality to underpin an autonomous agent for delivering self-management support to older adults living with COPD and potentially other LTCs.", "An electrical cortical stimulation provides important information for functional brain mapping. However, subjective responses (i.e. sensory, visual, and auditory symptoms) are purely detected by patients' descriptions, and may be affected by patients' awareness and intelligence levels. We experienced psychogenic responses in the electrical cortical stimulation of two patients with intractable epilepsy. A sham stimulation was useful for differentiating pseudo-responses from real responses in the electrical cortical stimulation. Inductive questions, long testing durations, and clear cues of stimulation onsets need to be avoided to prevent psychogenic pseudo-responses in the electrical cortical stimulation. Furthermore, a sham stimulation is applicable for detecting pseudo-responses the moment patients show atypical or inexplicable symptoms.", "For autonomous robot-delivered surgeries to ever become a feasible option, we recommend the combination of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) and transparent machine learning (ML), with integrated Gross anatomy models. This can be supplemented with medical imaging data of cadavers for performance evaluation.\nWe reviewed technological advances and state-of-the-art documented developments. We undertook a literature search on surgical robotics and skills, tracing agent studies, relevant frameworks, and standards for AI. This embraced transparency aspects of AI.\nWe recommend \"a procedure/skill template\" for teaching AI that can be used by a surgeon. Similar existing methodologies show that when such a metric-based approach is used for training surgeons, cardiologists, and anesthetists, it results in a >40% error reduction in objectively assessed intraoperative procedures. The integration of Explainable AI and ML, and novel tissue characterization sensorics to tele-operated robotic-assisted procedures with medical imaged cadavers, provides robotic guidance and refines tissue classifications at a molecular level.", "Introduction: This study investigated variables associated with subjective decline in executive function among Veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) following a history of blast-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Method: Fifty-six male U.S. Veterans (MAge\u00a0=\u00a035.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8\u00a0years) with a history of blast-related mTBI (6.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0years post injury) completed a battery of self-report questionnaires and neuropsychological measures. Participants rated current and retrospectively estimated pre-mTBI executive function difficulties on the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe). A difference score (post- minus pre-mTBI ratings) was the dependent variable (\u2206FrSBe). Linear regression models examined variables predicting \u2206FrSBe, including: pre-injury characteristics (education, premorbid intelligence), injury-related characteristics (number of blast exposures, losses of consciousness), post-injury clinical symptoms (PTSD Checklist-Military version; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and post-injury neuropsychological performances on executive function measures (Trail Making Test Part B; Controlled Oral Word Association Test; Auditory Consonant Trigrams; Wisconsin Card Sorting Test). Results: While 11% of participants had a clinically elevated pre-injury FrSBe total score, 82% had a clinically elevated post-injury FrSBe total score. Only self-reported PTSD symptom severity independently predicted perceived change in executive function. Conclusions: Many OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with a history of blast-related mTBI experience subjective decline in executive function following injury. Perceived executive function decline was associated with higher PTSD symptom severity, aligning with previous research associating PTSD with cognitive complaints. Results did not support a correspondence between perceived cognitive change and neuropsychological performances.", "Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are progressive degenerative diseases mainly affect brain and retina. They are characterized by accumulation of autofluorescent storage material, mitochondrial ATPase subunit C, or sphingolipid activator proteins A and D in lysosomes of most cells. Heterogenous storage material in NCLs is not completely disease-specific. Most of CLN proteins and their natural substrates are not well-characterized. Studies have suggested variants of Late-Infantile NCLs (LINCLs) include the major type CLN2 and minor types CLN5, CLN6, CLN7, and CLN8. Therefore, combination of clinical and molecular analysis has become a more effective diagnosis method. We studied 4 late-infantile NCL siblings characterized by seizures, ataxia as early symptoms, followed by progressive regression in intelligence and behavior, but mutations are located in different genes. Symptoms and progression of 4 types of LINCLs are compared. Pathology of LINCLs is also discussed. We performed Nest-Generation Sequencing on these phenotypically similar families. Three novel variants c.1551+1insTGAT in TPP1, c.244G>T in CLN6, c.554-5A>G in MFSD8 were identified. Potential outcome of the mutations in structure and function of proteins are studied. In addition, we observed some common and unique clinical features of Chinese LINCL patient as compared with those of Western patients, which greatly improved our understanding of the LINCLs.", "Dr Peter Barlow, who died in 2017, was one of the most respected botanists and biologists of the latter half of the 20th Century. His interests covered a wide range of plant biological topics, e.g. root growth and development, plant cytoskeleton, effects of gravity, plant intelligence, pattern formation, and evolution of eukaryotic cells. Here we consider Peter's numerous contributions to the: elucidation of plant patterns; understanding of root biology; role of the plant cytoskeleton in growth and development; influence of the Moon on terrestrial vegetation; Cell Body concept; and plant neurobiology. In so doing we attempt not only to provide an overview of Peter's important work in many areas of plant biology, but also to place that work in the context of recent advances in plant and biological sciences.", "To study impairments of cognitive control in patients with somatoform disorders (SD) and to evaluate the efficacy of recognan in the treatment of this pathology.\nForty-six patients with SD, aged from 18 to 45 years, were studied. A clinical history, neurological examination, and assessment of autonomic disorders were collected from all patients. For the objectification of the severity of asthenic and emotional disorders, the Subjective Scale of Asthenia (MFI-20), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HARS), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ were used. A quantitative assessment of impaired attention and impulsivity was performed using the psychophysiological test TOVA. Patients were treated with recognan (citicoline). The control group consisted of 30 healthy people aged from 18 to 45 years.\nPatients with SD had specific characteristics of the cognitive sphere, most pronounced in the form of attention disorders. The psychological study showed the higher level of anxiety. In addition, patients with SD were characterized by the low levels of emotional intelligence and cognitive control of emotions compared with the control group. The results of the follow-up study after treatment suggest the high efficacy of recognan in the treatment of SD (improvement was noted in 67.4% of patients). A significant decrease in the severity of autonomic disorders and in indicators characterizing asthenia was established after the treatment.\n\u0426\u0435\u043b\u044c

developed for diagnosing childhood cataracts and providing risk stratification and treatment recommendations. The high accuracy of CC-Cruiser was previously validated using specific datasets. The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic efficacy and treatment decision-making capacity between CC-Cruiser and ophthalmologists in real-world clinical settings.\nThis multicentre randomized controlled trial was performed in five ophthalmic clinics in different areas across China. Pediatric patients (aged\u202f\u2264\u202f14\u202fyears) without a definitive diagnosis of cataracts or history of previous eye surgery were randomized (1:1) to receive a diagnosis and treatment recommendation from either CC-Cruiser or senior consultants (with over 5\u202fyears of clinical experience in pediatric ophthalmology). The experts who provided a gold standard diagnosis, and the investigators who performed slit-lamp photography and data analysis were blinded to the group assignments. The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance for childhood cataracts with reference to cataract experts' standards. The secondary outcomes included the evaluation of disease severity and treatment determination, the time required for the diagnosis, and patient satisfaction, which was determined by the mean rating. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03240848).\nBetween August 9, 2017 and May 25, 2018, 350 participants (700 eyes) were randomly assigned for diagnosis by CC-Cruiser (350 eyes) or senior consultants (350 eyes). The accuracies of cataract diagnosis and treatment determination were 87.4% and 70.8%, respectively, for CC-Cruiser, which were significantly lower than 99.1% and 96.7%, respectively, for senior consultants (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, OR\u202f=\u202f0.06 [95% CI 0.02 to 0.19]; and p\u202f<\u202f0.001, OR\u202f=\u202f0.08 [95% CI 0.03 to 0.25], respectively). The mean time for receiving a diagnosis from CC-Cruiser was 2.79\u202fmin, which was significantly less than 8.53\u202fmin for senior consultants (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, mean difference 5.74 [95% CI 5.43 to 6.05]). The patients were satisfied with the overall medical service quality provided by CC-Cruiser, typically with its time-saving feature in cataract diagnosis.\nCC-Cruiser exhibited less accurate performance comparing to senior consultants in diagnosing childhood cataracts and making treatment decisions. However, the medical service provided by CC-Cruiser was less time-consuming and achieved a high level of patient satisfaction. CC-Cruiser has the capacity to assist human doctors in clinical practice in its current state.\nNational Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC0116500) and the Key Research Plan for the National Natural Science Foundation of China in Cultivation Project (91846109).", "The digitalization of healthcare systems is no longer a\u00a0trend but a\u00a0reality, which is driven by the rapid developments in the fields of medicine, information and communication technology (ICT). It revolutionizes the practice of medicine by making innovative treatment forms possible by the accelerated exchange of patient data. In this way it brings tremendous advantages to all stakeholders in healthcare delivery. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity, the decreasing number of physicians, long distances and poor road infrastructure between doctors and patients create loopholes in the delivery of healthcare services, especially in rural regions, which can at least partially be filled by the use of telemedicine. The acceptance of ehealth is the most important success factor in its use for the management of patients. User-friendliness, efficiency, effectiveness, legal safety and reimbursement of telemedical services are the important conditions for this. Furthermore, training and continuing training of healthcare personnel also drive the development of telemedicine. Factors delaying the use of telemedicine are partial lack of reimbursement and lack of interoperability among different systems of medical technology. Pilot projects serve to provide evidence for the usefulness and effectiveness of telemedicine. They also help to build the structural foundation on which telemedicine can develop. Examples of such projects are emergency triage, online video consultations and digital care projects. There are many emerging trends in the field of digital health, which are developing at different paces. Examples of such trends are artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain and augmented reality.", "Although cognitive neuroscience has made remarkable progress in understanding the neural foundations of goal-directed behavior and decision making, neuroscience research on decision making competence, the capacity to resist biases in human judgment and decision making, remain to be established. Here, we investigated the cognitive and neural mechanisms of decision making competence in 283 healthy young adults. We administered the Adult Decision Making Competence battery to assess the respondent's capacity to resist standard biases in decision making, including: (1) resistance to framing, (2) recognizing social norms, (3) over/under confidence, (4) applying decision rules, (5) consistency in risk perception, and (6) resistance to sunk costs. Decision making competence was assessed in relation to core facets of intelligence, including measures of crystallized intelligence (Shipley Vocabulary), fluid intelligence (Figure\u00a0Series), and logical reasoning (LSAT). Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the relationship(s) between each cognitive domain, followed by an investigation of their association with individual differences in cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and cortical gray matter volume as measured by high-resolution structural MRI. The results suggest that: (i) decision making competence is associated with cognitive operations for logical reasoning, and (ii) these convergent processes are associated with individual differences within cortical regions that are widely implicated in cognitive control (left dACC) and social decision making (right superior temporal sulcus; STS). Our findings motivate an integrative framework for understanding the neural mechanisms of decision making competence, suggesting that individual differences in the cortical surface area of left dACC and right STS are associated with the capacity to overcome decision biases and exhibit competence in decision making.", "Dissociative disorder is a common neurotic disorder. Patients with dissociative disorder experience significant psychological distress and have deficits in various domains of neurocognitive functions.\nTo assess the neurocognitive functioning of adolescents diagnosed with dissociative disorder and compare it with that of healthy controls.\nThis is a cross-sectional observational study conducted on adolescents diagnosed with dissociative disorder, attending child and adolescent specialty clinic of a tertiary care hospital of North India from October 2016 to February 2017. Healthy control subjects were also recruited for comparison on study variables. Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian children and standardized neuropsychological tools were administered for the assessment of intellectual functioning and neurocognitive functioning.\nA total of 50 participants with dissociative disorder and 50 healthy controls completed the study. Participants of both the groups had an average level of intellectual functioning. Participants with dissociative disorder showed poorer performance on tasks of attention and executive functions. After the Bonferroni correction, deficits were detected in the domains of coding (P = 0.0012), maze (P = 0.0001), and mathematics (P = 0.0016).\nAdolescents with dissociative disorder have impaired neurocognitive functions in comparison to healthy controls.", "Nurse leaders are dually responsible for resource stewardship and the delivery of high-quality care. However, methods to identify patient risk for hospital-acquired conditions are often outdated and crude. Although hospitals and health systems have begun to use data science and artificial intelligence in physician-led projects, these innovative methods have not seen adoption in nursing. We propose the Petri dish model, a theoretical hybrid model, which combines population ecology theory and human factors theory to explain the cost/benefit dynamics influencing the slow adoption of data science for hospital-based nursing. The proliferation of nurse-led data science in health systems may be facing several barriers: a scarcity of doctorally prepared nurse scientists with expertise in data science; internal structural inertia; an unaligned national \"precision health\" strategy; and a federal reimbursement landscape, which constrains-but does not negate the hard dollar business case. Nurse executives have several options: deferring adoption, outsourcing services, and investing in internal infrastructure to develop and implement risk models. The latter offers the best performing models. Progress in nurse-led data science work has been sluggish. Balanced partnerships with physician experts and organizational stakeholders are needed, as is a balanced PhD-DNP research-practice collaboration model.", "Background: Individuals with severe mental illnesses are at greater risk of offenses and violence, though the relationship remains unclear due to the interplay of static and dynamic risk factors. Static factors have generally been emphasized, leaving little room for temporal changes in risk. Hence, this longitudinal study aims to identify subgroups of psychiatric populations at risk of violence and criminality by taking into account the dynamic changes of symptomatology and substance use. Method: A total of 825 patients from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study having completed five postdischarge follow-ups were analyzed. Individuals were classified into outcome trajectories (violence and criminality). Trajectories were computed for each substance (cannabis, alcohol, and cocaine, alone or combined) and for symptomatology and inputted as dynamic factors, along with other demographic and psychiatric static factors, into binary logistic regressions for predicting violence and criminality. Best predictors were then identified using backward elimination, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for both models. Results: Two trajectories were found for violence (low versus high violence). Best predictors for belonging in the high-violence group were low verbal intelligence (baseline), higher psychopathy (baseline) and anger (mean) scores, persistent cannabis use (alone), and persistent moderate affective symptoms. The model's area under the curve (AUC) was 0.773. Two trajectories were also chosen as being optimal for criminality. The final model to predict high criminality yielded an AUC of 0.788, retaining as predictors male sex, lower educational level, higher score of psychopathy (baseline), persistent polysubstance use (cannabis, cocaine, and alcohol), and persistent cannabis use (alone). Both models were moderately predictive of outcomes. Conclusion: Static factors identified as predictors are consistent with previously published literature. Concerning dynamic factors, unexpectedly, cannabis alone was an independent co-occurring variable, as well as affective symptoms, in the violence model. For criminality, our results are novel, as there are very few studies on criminal behaviors in nonforensic psychiatric populations. In conclusion, these results emphasize the need to further study the predictors of crime, separately from violence and the impact of longitudinal patterns of specific substance use and high affective symptoms.", "We apply an artificial intelligence approach to simulate the impact of financial market regulations on systemic risk-a topic vigorously discussed since the financial crash of 2007-09. Experts often disagree on the efficacy of these regulations to avert another market collapse, such as the collateralization of interbank (counterparty) derivatives trades to mitigate systemic risk. A limiting factor is the availability of proprietary bank trading data. Even if this hurdle could be overcome, however, analyses would still be hampered by segmented financial markets where banks trade under different regulatory systems. We therefore adapt a simulation technology, combining advances in graph theoretic models and machine learning to randomly generate entire financial systems derived from realistic distributions of bank trading data. We then compute counterparty credit risk under various scenarios to evaluate and predict the impact of financial regulations at all levels-from a single trade to individual banks to systemic risk. We find that under various stress testing scenarios collateralization reduces the costs of resolving a financial system, yet it does not change the distribution of those costs and can have adverse effects on individual participants in extreme situations. Moreover, the concentration of credit risk does not necessarily correlate monotonically with systemic risk. While the analysis focuses on counterparty credit risk, the method generalizes to other risks and metrics in a straightforward manner.", "Psychopathy continues to be a challenge in forensic contexts, and evidence of its association with destructive behaviors, such as aggressive antisocial behaviors, is extensive. However, the potential role of intelligence as moderator of the well-established association between psychopathy and aggressive antisocial behaviors has largely been neglected, despite intelligence having been independently related to both concepts. Increased knowledge of whether intelligence is relevant to this association is needed because of its possible implications on the assessment and treatment of individuals with psychopathic traits and aggressive antisocial behaviors. This study aimed to investigate the association between psychopathic traits, aggressive antisocial behaviors, and intelligence in young violent offenders and to test whether intelligence moderates the relationship between psychopathic traits and aggressive antisocial behaviors. Participants were 269 male violent offenders aged 18-25 years, assessed on the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R), the Life History of Aggression (LHA), and the General Ability Index from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition. Associations were tested with Spearman's rho, and moderation analysis was performed through ordinary least squares regressions. The PCL-R four-facet structure was used for the analyses. We found a positive association between psychopathic traits and aggressive antisocial behaviors, and a small negative association between the Affective PCL-R facet and intelligence. In the moderation analyses, a small yet statistically significant moderation effect of intelligence on the association between the Interpersonal facet and LHA total scores was demonstrated. However, the amount of variance in the LHA total score explained by the model was very small: 2.9%. We suggest that intelligence, however, important for rehabilitation strategies and everyday functioning, is not necessarily pertinent to understanding aggressive antisocial behaviors in young offenders with psychopathic traits.", "In dealing with the impacts of our changing climate, the sun, air, and water are the three main factors that will affect our ability to maintain a healthy and livable living environment. The two United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of \"health welfare\" and \"sustainable city\" relate closely to how societies face climate change. Applying smart technologies such as the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), big data, blockchains, and the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud calculation, and network management allows designers to access information on relational and adaptive environmental designs. Moreover, these technologies help us learn evolutionary computation information in order to provide advanced mechanisms. Models that help promote the implementation of smart neighborhoods and cities integrate smart technologies and IoT in order to improve air quality and living convenience and achieve living environments that are livable and healthy. This article primarily addresses the impacts of climate change on our living environment and how we may use green and smart buildings to ameliorate the effects of this change on daily life, promote the efficient use of water resources, and make living spaces significantly more environmentally friendly. In addition, we hope to apply the idea of smart IoT and big data analysis to design \"passive toughness adaptation\" and \"automatic sensing prevention\" into healthy living environments, which may facilitate our ability to handle the problems of super-ageing societies and to adapt to the diminishing birthrate. An intelligent and resilient environment that is appropriate for all age groups may provide a valuable path forward for preparing effectively for the impacts of climate change.\n\u5c0e\u5165\u667a\u6167\u79d1\u6280\u8207\u97cc\u6027\u8abf\u9069\u4e4b\u5065\u5eb7\u4f4f\u5c45\u74b0\u5883\u8a2d\u8a08.\n\u7576\u524d\u9762\u5c0d\u6c23\u5019\u8b8a\u9077\u4e4b\u885d\u64ca\uff0c\u69cb\u6210\u751f\u547d\u4e4b\u4e09\u8981\u7d20\uff1a\u967d\u5149\u3001\u7a7a\u6c23\u8207\u6c34\u6210\u70ba\u91cd\u8981\u74b0\u5883\u5c0d\u61c9\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u7dad\u6301\u53ef\u6c38\u7e8c\u751f\u5b58\u4e4b\u5065\u5eb7\u5b9c\u5c45\u74b0\u5883\uff0c\u5f9e\u806f\u5408\u570b\u6c38\u7e8c\u767c\u5c55\u76ee\u6a19\uff08Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs\uff09\u64ec\u5b9a\uff0c\u5c07\u300c\u5065\u5eb7\u798f\u7949\u300d\u8207\u300c\u6c38\u7e8c\u57ce\u5e02\u300d\u76ee\u6a19\u8a2d\u5b9a\u70ba\u53ef\u9762\u5c0d\u6c23\u5019\u8b8a\u9077\u300c\u97cc\u6027\u8abf\u9069\u300d\u4e4b\u300c\u5065\u5eb7\u4f4f\u5c45\u74b0\u5883\u300d\uff0c\u5176\u9054\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u5fc5\u9808\u900f\u904e\u5c0e\u5165\u300c\u667a\u6167\u79d1\u6280\u300d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff1a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7269\u806f\u7db2\uff08artificial intelligence and internet of things, AIoT\uff09\u3001\u5927\u6578\u64da\u3001\u4e92\u806f\u7db2\u3001\u5340\u584a\u93c8\u3001\u96f2\u7aef\u8a08\u7b97\u3001\u7db2\u683c\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\uff0c\u7372\u53d6\u8abf\u9069\u8cc7\u8a0a\u8207\u9810\u6e2c\u53ca\u9023\u52d5\u76f8\u95dc\u5c0d\u61c9\u4e4b\u74b0\u5883\u8a2d\u65bd\u8207\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0c\u4e26\u53ef\u5b78\u7fd2\u6f14\u5316\u8a08\u7b97\u76f8\u95dc\u8cc7\u8a0a\u5f8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9810\u5148\u8abf\u9069\u4e4b\u6a5f\u5236\u3002\u900f\u904e\u300c\u667a\u6167\u793e\u5340\u8207\u57ce\u5e02\u300d\u4e4b\u63a8\u52d5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e32\u9023\u667a\u6167\u79d1\u6280\u8207\u7269\u806f\u7db2\u6539\u5584\u7a7a\u6c23\u54c1\u8cea\u8207\u751f\u6d3b\u4fbf\u5229\uff0c\u5275\u9020\u53ef\u5b9c\u5c45\u4e4b\u5065\u5eb7\u4f4f\u5c45\u74b0\u5883\u3002\u672c\u6587\u76ee\u7684\u8a55\u8ad6\u6c23\u5019\u8b8a\u9077\u5c0d\u65bc\u5efa\u7bc9\u751f\u6d3b\u74b0\u5883\u4e4b\u885d\u64ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u7da0\u5efa\u7bc9\u3001\u667a\u6167\u5efa\u7bc9\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\u8a2d\u65bd\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u4e9e\u71b1\u5e36\u6c23\u5019\u4e4b\u7a7a\u6c23\u54c1\u8cea\u3001\u6c34\u8cc7\u6e90\u53ca\u5efa\u7bc9\u7269\u7da0\u5316\u4f5c\u70ba\u6e1b\u7de9\u8207\u8abf\u9069\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0e\u5165\u667a\u6167\u7269\u806f\u7db2\u5927\u6578\u64da\u5206\u6790\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u300c\u88ab\u52d5\u97cc\u6027\u8abf\u9069\u300d\u8207\u300c\u4e3b\u52d5\u611f\u77e5\u9810\u9632\u300d\uff0c\u4f5c\u70ba\u97cc\u6027\u8abf\u9069\u4e4b\u5065\u5eb7\u4f4f\u5c45\u74b0\u5883\u8a2d\u8a08\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u81fa\u7063\u6b63\u9762\u81e8\u8d85\u9ad8\u9f61\u793e\u6703\u8207\u5c11\u5b50\u5e7c\u5152\u7167\u8b77\uff0c\u667a\u6167\u97cc\u6027\u4e4b\u5168\u9f61\u74b0\u5883\u8a2d\u8a08\u53ef\u4f5c\u70ba\u5c0d\u61c9\u6c23\u5019\u8b8a\u9077\u885d\u64ca\u4e4b\u8a2d\u8a08\u53c3\u8003\u3002.", "This brief paper summarizes a mixed method review of over 500 neuroscientific reports investigating the proposition that general intelligence (g or IQ) and multiple intelligences (MI) can be integrated based on common and unique neural systems. Extrapolated from this interpretation are five principles that inform teaching and curriculum so that education can be strengths-based and personalized to promote academic achievement. This framework is proposed as a comprehensive model for a system of educational cognitive neuroscience that will serve the fields of neuroscience as well as educators. Five key principles identified are culture matters, every brain is unique-activate strengths, know thyself, embodied cognition/emotional rudder, and make it mean something.", "The articles in this special issue provide an overview of the wide breadth of questions and methodologies that arise when the research devoted to intelligence intersect with the research devoted to U.S. education. The unique contributions of each paper are highlighted and discussed based on their contribution to the literature. The implications of these findings for educational research and policy are briefly discussed.", "Recent accounts of autistic perception, including Bayesian accounts, hypothesize a reduced influence of prior knowledge on perception across different domains in the autism spectrum (AS). The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of prior linguistic knowledge, in the form of phonemic categorical knowledge, on speech perception in adults with AS condition. As phonemic categorical knowledge is shaped by language experience and abilities, we furthermore distinguished AS participants with (AS-SOD) or without a history of speech onset delay (AS-noSOD); the control group comprises typical individuals matched for age, nonverbal intelligence, and reading abilities. We also controlled for the influence of auditory-verbal short-term retention capacities by administering word list and nonword list repetition tasks. We did not observe any reduced influence of prior phonemic knowledge on the perception of speech stimuli nor did we observed any increased perceptual abilities for atypical variants of speech stimuli or nonspeech auditory stimuli, either between the two autistic groups or relative to the control group. Short-term memory abilities appeared to be superior in the AS-noSOD group relative to the AS-SOD and control groups, but this strength could be accounted for by their higher vocabulary knowledge. The preservation of categorical perception in verbal autistic adults observed in this study challenges models claiming a reduced influence of prior knowledge on perception across domains in the AS. Autism Res 2019. \u00a9 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: A reduced influence of prior knowledge has been considered to characterize perceptual abilities in people with autism. In this article, we examine this claim by assessing nonlinguistic and linguistic auditory perception abilities in adults with autism, and by further distinguishing between autism with or without a history of delayed language development. We did not observe any reduced influence of prior language knowledge on the perception of speech stimuli nor did we observe any increased perceptual abilities for atypical variants of speech stimuli or nonspeech auditory stimuli, and this relative to a control group matched on age, nonverbal intellectual efficiency, and reading abilities. Our results challenge models claiming a reduced influence of prior knowledge on perception across domains in the AS.", "In this work, on the one hand, we examined the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and empathy and, on the other, the relationship between EI and non-verbal sensitivity, through two independent studies. The first study analyzed the relationship between dimensions of EI and aspects of empathy, in a sample of 856 participants who completed two measures of EI, the trait meta-mood scale (TMMS) and the trait emotional intelligence questionnaire (TEIQue), and a measure of empathy, the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI). The results showed a similar pattern of significant positive relations in all the EI domains with empathic perspective-taking (PT), and significant negative relationships with empathic personal distress (PD), except for the EI domain of attention, which had a positive relationship. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that the dimension that best predicted empathic PT and empathic concern (EC) was the emotionality factor; whereas attention best predicted empathic fantasy; and the self-control factor best predicted PD, although negatively. Gender emerged as a predictor of three empathic aspects, fantasy, EC, and PD, with women obtaining higher scores than men in all of them. Age was the only predictor of fantasy, with a negative relationship. The second study involved 646 people who completed the same measures of EI as the participants of the first study and the mini-profile of non-verbal sensitivity (Mini-PONS). The results showed some significant relationships between EI dimensions and the channels and quadrants of the MiniPONS. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that very few EI dimensions predicted non-verbal sensitivity, with attention obtaining the best result. Both gender and age emerged as predictors, some in unique cases, of channels, quadrants, and of the total score of non-verbal sensitivity; age had a negative relationship, and women obtained higher scores than men.", "The face is arguably the most unique and defining feature of the human body. From birth, humans are conditioned to perceive, interpret, and react to information conveyed by faces both familiar and unfamiliar. Although face recognition is routine for humans, only recently has it become possible for a computer to accurately recognize a human face in an image or video. With advances in artificial intelligence, image capture technology, and Internet connectivity, facial recognition technology has entered the forefront of personal and commercial technology. Plastic surgeons should be prepared to answer questions from patients about the fundamentals of facial recognition technology, and the potential effects of plastic surgery on facial recognition technology performance. This article provides an overview of facial recognition technology, describes its present applications, discusses its relevance within the field of plastic surgery, and provides recommendations for plastic surgeons to consider during preoperative discussions with patients.", "Meaningful recognition of nurses submitted by patients and families using interactive patient care (IPC) technology was analyzed using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify the themes and behaviors associated with extraordinary nursing.\nMeaningful recognition positively impacts nursing and organizational outcomes. The use of AI techniques such as natural language processing and machine learning to identify and describe behaviors impacting patient experiences is an emerging science.\nNurse recognition comments were collected from a convenience sample of 3 organizations via an IPC inpatient platform and analyzed using the AI techniques of natural language processing, machine learning, sentiment analytics, and corollary dictionaries based on rules of linguistics.\nThe top theme of nursing recognition comments was courtesy and respect with the behaviors of empathy/compassion, helpfulness, kindness, attentiveness, and emotional comfort. The theme of skills/knowledge was the 2nd most common, with the behaviors of being professional, knowledgeable, keeping track, competence, dedication, and being thorough.\nAI techniques for qualitative analysis of comments collected through IPC reveal nurse themes and behaviors most meaningful to patients and their family members. Nurses can advance the science of AI and guide its evolution so that nurse caring behaviors associated with establishing human connections that positively influence patient and family experience are accurately represented.", "In this paper, we consider the use of wearable sensors for providing affect-based adaptation in Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems. We begin with discussion of selected issues regarding the applications of affective computing techniques. We describe our experiments for affect change detection with a range of wearable devices, such as wristbands and the BITalino platform, and discuss an original software solution, which we developed for this purpose. Furthermore, as a test-bed application for our work, we selected computer games. We discuss the state-of-the-art in affect-based adaptation in games, described in terms of the so-called affective loop. We present our original proposal of a conceptual design framework for games, called the affective game design patterns. As a proof-of-concept realization of this approach, we discuss some original game prototypes, which we have developed, involving emotion-based control and adaptation. Finally, we comment on a software framework, that we have previously developed, for context-aware systems which uses human emotional contexts. This framework provides means for implementing adaptive systems using mobile devices with wearable sensors.", "The lifestyle of modern society has changed significantly with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) technologies in recent years. Artificial intelligence is a multidimensional technology with various components such as advanced algorithms, ML and DL. Together, AI, ML, and DL are expected to provide automated devices to ophthalmologists for early diagnosis and timely treatment of ocular disorders in the near future. In fact, AI, ML, and DL have been used in ophthalmic setting to validate the diagnosis of diseases, read images, perform corneal topographic mapping and intraocular lens calculations. Diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma are the 3 most common causes of irreversible blindness on a global scale. Ophthalmic imaging provides a way to diagnose and objectively detect the progression of a number of pathologies including DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders. There are 2 methods of imaging used as diagnostic methods in ophthalmic practice: fundus digital photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Of note, OCT has become the most widely used imaging modality in ophthalmology settings in the developed world. Changes in population demographics and lifestyle, extension of average lifespan, and the changing pattern of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, DR, AMD, and glaucoma create a rising demand for such images. Furthermore, the limitation of availability of retina specialists and trained human graders is a major problem in many countries. Consequently, given the current population growth trends, it is inevitable that analyzing such images is time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. Therefore, the detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic disorders through unmanned automated applications system in the near future will be inevitable. We provide an overview of the potential impact of the current AI, ML, and DL methods and their applications on the early detection and treatment of DR, AMD, glaucoma, and other ophthalmic diseases.", "The effect of the combined direct/indirect revascularization surgery in Moyamoya disease has not been evaluated sufficiently with regard to cognitive function, brain microstructure, and connectivity.\nTo investigate structural and functional changes following revascularization surgery in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) through a combined analysis of brain morphology, microstructure, connectivity, and neurobehavioral data.\nNeurobehavioral and neuroimaging examinations were performed in 25 adults with MMD prior to and\u00a0>12 mo after revascularization surgery. Cognitive function was investigated using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, Trail-Making Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Continuous Performance Test, Stroop test, and Wechsler Memory Scale. We assessed white matter integrity using diffusion tensor imaging, brain morphometry using magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequences, and brain connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nCognitive examinations revealed significant changes in the full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ), performance IQ (PIQ), perceptual organization (PO), processing speed, and Stroop test scores after surgery (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Enlargement of the lateral ventricle, volume reductions in the corpus callosum and subcortical nuclei, and cortical thinning in the prefrontal cortex were also observed (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Fractional anisotropy in the white matter tracts, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, increased 2 to 4 yr after surgery, relative to that observed in the presurgical state (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Resting-state brain connectivity was increased predominantly in the fronto-cerebellar circuit and was positively correlated with improvements in PIQ and PO (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05).\nRevascularization surgery may improve processing speed and attention in adult patients with MMD. Further, multimodal MRI may be useful for detecting subtle postsurgical brain structural changes, reorganization of white matter tracts, and brain connectivity alterations.", "This review advances the discussion about the future of laboratory medicine in the 2020s. In five major topic areas: 1. the \"big picture\" of healthcare; 2. pre-analytical factors; 3. Analytical factors; 4. post-analytical factors; and 5. relationships, which explores a next decade perspective on laboratory medicine and the likely impact of the predicted changes by means of a number of carefully focused questions that draw upon predictions made since 2013. The \"big picture\" of healthcare explores the effects of changing patient populations, the brain-to-brain loop, direct access testing, robots and total laboratory automation, and green technologies and sustainability. The pre-analytical section considers the role of different sample types, drones, and biobanks. The analytical section examines advances in point-of-care testing, mass spectrometry, genomics, gene and immunotherapy, 3D-printing, and total laboratory quality. The post-analytical section discusses the value of laboratory medicine, the emerging role of artificial intelligence, the management and interpretation of omics data, and common reference intervals and decision limits. Finally, the relationships section explores the role of laboratory medicine scientific societies, the educational needs of laboratory professionals, communication, the relationship between laboratory professionals and clinicians, laboratory medicine financing, and the anticipated economic opportunities and outcomes in the 2020's.", "This study aims to investigate the prediction of critical buckling load of steel columns using two hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) models such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System optimized by Genetic Algorithm (ANFIS-GA) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (ANFIS-PSO). For this purpose, a total number of 57 experimental buckling tests of novel high strength steel Y-section columns were collected from the available literature to generate the dataset for training and validating the two proposed AI models. Quality assessment criteria such as coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used to validate and evaluate the performance of the prediction models. Results showed that both ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO had a strong ability in predicting the buckling load of steel columns, but ANFIS-PSO (R2 = 0.929, RMSE = 60.522 and MAE = 44.044) was slightly better than ANFIS-GA (R2 = 0.916, RMSE = 65.371 and MAE = 48.588). The two models were also robust even with the presence of input variability, as investigated via Monte Carlo simulations. This study showed that the hybrid AI techniques could help constructing an efficient numerical tool for buckling analysis.", "Estimate the probabilistic potential of introduction of the causative agent of influenza type A in Mexico, using geo-intelligence applied to health.\nEcological study of 1,973 influenza outbreaks with a high degree of pathogenicity, worldwide during the period 2014-2016. Geospatial modeling was developed with geo-intelligence tools such as spatial representation, a relational model, spatial characterization of the inoculum source with the maximum entropy model and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, using multicriteria spatial analysis. This was validated with the Moran index and geographically weighted regression.\nIsochrones (at an initial distance of 548 km) were estimated for health risks and their exponential growth; at the fourth isochrone, the east and west coasts of the United States of America and a part of Central America were identified as possible areas that favor the introduction of the pathogen. Also, a COR curve = 0.923 was obtained; two risk periods for introduction were identified (September-March and April-August, with north-south and south-north trajectories, respectively) with high positive autocorrelation for geospatial modeling; and in one scenario, more than half of Mexico was found to be at high risk of introduction, with an estimated 78 million people exposed.

Although it is known that persistent pain is associated with considerable impairment in youth without SCD, little is known about the functional effects of persistent pain in SCD. The current study aimed to (a) characterize persistent pain in youth with SCD and (b) determine the extent to which youth with SCD and persistent pain differ in disease morbidity, functional impairment, and neurocognitive and psychological functioning.\nEighty-nine participants (ages 7-16) and caregivers completed questionnaires (BRIEF [Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function], Conners-3 [Conners-third edition], and PedsQL\u2122-SCD Module, where PedsQL is Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory). Participants completed neurocognitive tests WISC-V [Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-fifth edition], WJ-III [Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement-third edition], and WIAT-III [Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-third edition]). Youth were classified as having persistent pain if they reported daily pain for 7 days. Chi-square and independent sample t-test analyses were used to assess group differences (those with vs without persistent pain).\nPatients with persistent pain (n\u00a0=\u00a018) reported lower health-related quality of life (P\u00a0=\u00a0.000). Caregivers were more likely to rate youth with persistent pain as having lower planning/organization abilities (P\u00a0=\u00a0.011) and clinically elevated symptoms of defiance/aggression and oppositional defiance (Ps\u00a0=\u00a0.00; .01). Patients with persistent pain demonstrated poorer working memory (P\u00a0=\u00a0.023) and processing speed (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), and fewer demonstrating reading fluency abilities in the average or above range (P\u00a0=\u00a0.026).\nYouth with SCD and persistent pain are at risk for psychosocial and neurocognitive impairments, suggesting that persistent pain may be an important indicator of disease burden. Furthermore, disease management may be enhanced by assessing cognitive and psychosocial functioning and incorporating interdisciplinary treatments addressing impairment associated with persistent pain.", "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been proposed for the prognosis of cervical myelopathy (CM), but the manual analysis of DTI features is complicated and time consuming. This study evaluated the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in the analysis of DTI for the prognosis of CM. Seventy-five patients who underwent surgical treatment for CM were recruited for DTI imaging and were divided into two groups based on their one-year follow-up recovery. The DTI features of fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity were extracted from DTI maps of all cervical levels. Conventional AI models using logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and a radial basis function kernel support vector machine (RBF-SVM) were built using these DTI features. In addition, a deep learning model was applied to the DTI maps. Their performances were compared using 50 repeated 10-fold cross-validations. The accuracy of the classifications reached 74.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6% for LR, 85.6%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4% for KNN, 89.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6% for RBF-SVM, and 59.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8% for the deep leaning model. The RBF-SVM algorithm achieved the best accuracy, with sensitivity and specificity of 85.0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4% and 92.4%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9% respectively. This finding indicates that AI methods are feasible and effective for DTI analysis for the prognosis of CM.", "The underlying microstructural properties of white matter differences in children born very preterm (<32\u202fweeks gestational age) can be investigated in depth using multi-shell diffusion imaging. The present study compared white matter across the whole brain using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) metrics in children born very preterm and full-term children at six years of age. We also investigated associations between white matter microstructure with early brain injury and developmental outcomes.\nMulti-shell diffusion imaging, T1-weighted anatomical MR images and developmental assessments were acquired in 23 children born very preterm (16 males; mean scan age: 6.57\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.34\u202fyears) and 24 full-term controls (10 males, mean scan age: 6.62\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.37\u202fyears). DTI metrics were obtained and neurite orientation dispersion index (ODI) and density index (NDI) were estimated using the NODDI diffusion model. FSL's tract-based spatial statistics were performed on traditional DTI metrics and NODDI metrics. Voxel-wise comparisons were performed to test between-group differences and within-group associations with developmental outcomes (intelligence and visual motor abilities) as well as early white matter injury and germinal matrix/intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH/IVH).\nIn comparison to term-born children, the children born very preterm exhibited lower fractional anisotropy (FA) across many white matter regions as well as higher mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and ODI. Within-group analyses of the children born very preterm revealed associations between higher FA and NDI with higher IQ and VMI. Lower ODI was found within the corona radiata in those with a history of white matter injury. Within the full-term group, associations were found between higher NDI and ODI with lower IQ.\nChildren born very preterm exhibit lower FA and higher ODI than full-term children. NODDI metrics provide more biologically specific information beyond DTI metrics as well as additional information of the impact of prematurity and white matter microstructure on cognitive outcomes at six years of age.", "Epilepsy is known to occur in a higher-than-expected proportion of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Prior studies of this heterogeneous disorder have suggested that intelligence quotient (IQ) may drive this relationship. Because intellectual disability (ID) is, independently of ASD, a risk factor for epilepsy, current literature calls into question the long-understood unique relationship between ASD and epilepsy. Second, data have been unclear about whether developmental regression in ASD is associated with epilepsy. Using two cohorts from an online research registry, totaling 6,975 children with ASD, we examined the independent role of four ASD severity measures in driving the relationship with epilepsy: ID, language impairment, core ASD symptom severity, and motor dysfunction, controlling for two known relevant factors: age and sex. We also examined whether developmental regression and epilepsy have an independent statistical link. All four ASD severity factors showed independent statistical associations with epilepsy in one cohort, and three in the other. ID showed the largest relative risk (RR) in both cohorts. Effect sizes were modest. Regression similarly showed an independent statistical association with epilepsy, but with small effect size. Similar to previous work, ID showed the greatest contribution to RR for epilepsy among children with ASD. However, other ASD severity markers showed statistical associations, demonstrating that the ASD-epilepsy association is not reducible to the effect of ID. Inconsistencies in the literature may be due to underpowered studies, yet moving forward with larger-n studies, clinical significance and scientific relevance may be dictated by effect size and not merely statistical significance. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1251-1259. \u00a9 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Epilepsy is known to occur more often in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) than is the case in the general population. The association between ASD and epilepsy is of interest because studying the two disorders in combination may help advance our understanding of genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms-as well as therapies-for both. Recent studies have suggested that intelligence quotient (IQ) alone in individuals with ASD may account for the increased prevalence of epilepsy. However, our approach was to look at a range of severity factors relevant to ASD and to look for correlations between each severity factor and epilepsy, within two large samples of children with ASD. In summary, we found that each severity factor-presence of intellectual disability, presence of language atypicalities, ASD-specific symptoms severity, and presence of motor issues-independently predicted a small increased risk for epilepsy, countering the argument that IQ alone is a risk factor. We also examined whether epilepsy is associated with developmental regression. Although severe epilepsy syndromes such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome are known to cause autistic-like symptoms following developmental regression, there is controversy about whether other forms of epilepsy are associated with the more common developmental regression seen in many young children with epilepsy. Indeed, we found a small association between epilepsy and developmental regression.", "Considering premorbid or \"peak\" adult intelligence (IQ) is important when examining post-stroke cognition. The stability of estimated premorbid IQ and its relationship to current cognitive ability in stroke is unknown. We investigated changes in estimated premorbid IQ and current cognitive ability up to three years post-stroke. Minor stroke patients (NIHSS < 8) were assessed at one to three months, one and three years' post-stroke. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) were used to estimate premorbid IQ (NART IQ) and current cognitive ability respectively at each time-point. Baseline demographics, vascular and stroke characteristics were included. Of the 264 patients recruited (mean age 66), 158 (60%), 151 (57%), and 153 (58%) completed cognitive testing at each time-point respectively. NART IQ initially increased (mean difference (MD) = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.54 to 2.13, p < 0.001) before decreasing (MD = -4.269, 95% CI = -5.12 to -3.41, p < 0.001). ACE-R scores initially remained stable (MD = 0.29, 95% CI = -0.49 to 1.07, p > 0.05) before decreasing (MD = -1.05, 95% CI = -2.08 to -0.01, p < 0.05). Adjusting for baseline variables did not change the relationship between NART IQ and ACE-R with time. Increases in NART IQ were associated with more education. For ACE-R, older age was associated with declines, and higher NART IQ and more education was associated with increases. Across 3 years, we observed fluctuations in estimated premorbid IQ and minor changes in current cognitive ability. Future research should aim to identify variables associated with these changes. However, studies of post-stroke cognition should account for premorbid IQ.", "Deep-learning algorithms typically fall within the domain of supervised artificial intelligence and are designed to \"learn\" from annotated data. Deep-learning models require large, diverse training datasets for optimal model convergence. The effort to curate these datasets is widely regarded as a barrier to the development of deep-learning systems. We developed RIL-Contour to accelerate medical image annotation for and with deep-learning. A major goal driving the development of the software was to create an environment which enables clinically oriented users to utilize deep-learning models to rapidly annotate medical imaging. RIL-Contour supports using fully automated deep-learning methods, semi-automated methods, and manual methods to annotate medical imaging with voxel and/or text annotations. To reduce annotation error, RIL-Contour promotes the standardization of image annotations across a dataset. RIL-Contour accelerates medical imaging annotation through the process of annotation by iterative deep learning (AID). The underlying concept of AID is to iteratively annotate, train, and utilize deep-learning models during the process of dataset annotation and model development. To enable this, RIL-Contour supports workflows in which multiple-image analysts annotate medical images, radiologists approve the annotations, and data scientists utilize these annotations to train deep-learning models. To automate the feedback loop between data scientists and image analysts, RIL-Contour provides mechanisms to enable data scientists to push deep newly trained deep-learning models to other users of the software. RIL-Contour and the AID methodology accelerate dataset annotation and model development by facilitating rapid collaboration between analysts, radiologists, and engineers.", "Currently, many critical care indices are not captured automatically at a granular level, rather are repetitively assessed by overburdened nurses. In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility of using pervasive sensing technology and artificial intelligence for autonomous and granular monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). As an exemplary prevalent condition, we characterized delirious patients and their environment. We used wearable sensors, light and sound sensors, and a camera to collect data on patients and their environment. We analyzed collected data to detect and recognize patient's face, their postures, facial action units and expressions, head pose variation, extremity movements, sound pressure levels, light intensity level, and visitation frequency. We found that facial expressions, functional status entailing extremity movement and postures, and environmental factors including the visitation frequency, light and sound pressure levels at night were significantly different between the delirious and non-delirious patients. Our results showed that granular and autonomous monitoring of critically ill patients and their environment is feasible using a noninvasive system, and we demonstrated its potential for characterizing critical care patients and environmental factors.", "Background: Low-income countries with relatively weak-health systems are highly vulnerable to public health threats. Effective public health system with a workforce to investigate outbreaks can reduce disease impact on livelihoods and economic development. Building effective public health partnerships is critical for sustainability of such a system. Uganda has made significant progress in responding to emergencies during the past quarter century, but its public health workforce is still inadequate in number and competency. Objectives: To reinforce implementation of priority public health programs in Uganda and cultivate core capacities for compliance with International Health Regulations. Methods: To develop a competent workforce to manage epidemics and improve disease surveillance, Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) established an advanced-level Field Epidemiology Training Program, called Public Health Fellowship Program (PHFP); closely modelled after the US CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service. PHFP is a 2-year, full-time, non-degree granting program targeting mid-career public health professionals. Fellows spend 85% of their field time in MoH placements learning through service delivery and gaining competencies in major domains. Results: During 2015-2018, PHFP enrolled 41 fellows, and graduated 30. Fellows were placed in 19 priority areas at MoH and completed 235 projects (91 outbreaks, 12 refugee assessments, 50 surveillance, and 60 epidemiologic studies, 3 cost analysis and 18 quality improvement); made 194 conference presentations; prepared 63 manuscripts for peer-reviewed publications (27 published as of December 2018); produced MoH bulletins, and developed three case studies. Projects have resulted in public health interventions with improvements in surveillance systems and disease control. Conclusion: During the 4 years of existence, PHFP has contributed greatly to improving real-time disease surveillance and outbreak response core capacities. Enhanced focus on evidence-based targeted approaches has increased effectiveness in outbreak response and control, and integration of PHFP within MoH has contributed to building a resilient and sustainable health system in Uganda.", "Bacopa monnieri (L.) - (BM) is a perennial, creeping herb which is widely used in traditional ayurvedic medicine as a neural tonic to improve intelligence and memory. Research into the biological effects of this plant has burgeoned in recent years, promising its neuroprotective and memory boosting ability among others. In this context, an extensive literature survey allows an insight into the participation of numerous signaling pathways and oxidative mechanism involved in the mitigation of oxidative stress, along with other indirect mechanisms modulated by bioactive molecules of BM to improve the cognitive action by their synergistic potential and cellular multiplicity mechanism. This multi-faceted review describes the novel mechanisms that underlie the unfounded but long flaunted promises of BM and thereby direct a way to harness this acquired knowledge to develop innovative approaches to manipulate its intracellular pathways.", "The latent variable \"\u03b4\" (for \"dementia) is a transdiagnostic measure of dementia severity. \u03b4 can be reified and applied to individuals as a composite \"d-score\". Like Spearman's general intelligence factor \"g\", \u03b4 can be constructed from almost any cognitive battery. So many are available that we must further distinguish each composite as a \u03b4 \"homolog\". Fourteen have been validated. All are strongly associated with dementia severity and potentially with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion.\nTo assess \u03b4's impact on MCI conversion risk.\nA new \u03b4 homolog (dDx) was constructed in 1,230 Mexican-American (MA) and 2,215 non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants in the Texas Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC). 1,445 normal controls (NC) and 723 MCI were followed annually for up to 6 years.\nEach SD decrease in the dDx score increased the risk of conversion sixteen-fold [OR\u200a=\u200a16.39 (CI: 5.0-52.6)]. Cases below the optimal diagnostic threshold for Alzheimer's disease (AD) versus NC were labeled as having a functionally salient cognitive impairment (FSCI). Such cases were at a 73-fold increase risk of a diagnosis of AD [OR\u200a=\u200a73.19 (95% CI: 58.3-92.0)]. However, 25.6% of MCI cases were also FSCI(+). They accounted disproportionately for prospective conversions. Age <80 years, the absence of an \u025b4 allele, <12 years of education, and MA ethnicity independently increased the risk of diagnosing FSCI as MCI.\nA sizable minority of MCI cases may be misdiagnosed and they account disproportionately for AD conversions.", "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great success in increasingly complex single-agent environments and two-player turn-based games. However, the real world contains multiple agents, each learning and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other agents. We used a tournament-style evaluation to demonstrate that an agent can achieve human-level performance in a three-dimensional multiplayer first-person video game, Quake III Arena in Capture the Flag mode, using only pixels and game points scored as input. We used a two-tier optimization process in which a population of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of parallel matches on randomly generated environments. Each agent learns its own internal reward signal and rich representation of the world. These results indicate the great potential of multiagent reinforcement learning for artificial intelligence research.", "Say hello to molly, Florence, and Ada-they're just a few of the helpful, smart algorithm powered chatbots taking their place in health care. Chatbots are computer programs designed to carry on a dialogue with people, assisting them via text messages, applications, or instant messaging. Essentially, instead of having a conversation with a person, the user talks with a bot that's powered by basic rules or artificial intelligence. Chatbots are already widely used to support, expedite, and improve processes in other industries, such as retail, and now, the technology is gaining traction in health care, where it is helping patients and providers perform myriad tasks.", "This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a physical-sport education pilot programme on adolescents' subjective well-being (health-related quality of life, positive affect and negative affect), trait emotional intelligence and social anxiety. The programme was based on the pedagogical sport education model within a quality physical education framework, and approached from the perspective of social and emotional learning. Participants were 113 compulsory secondary education students aged 12-15 years that were assigned to a control group (n = 44) and an experimental group (n = 69). A quasi-experimental design with repeated pre-test and post-test measures was used. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. The preliminary results obtained in this investigation revealed that the physical-sport education pilot programme promoted significant improvements in a specific indicator of subjective well-being and trait emotional intelligence in the experimental group. These encouraging findings support the pedagogical efficiency of the programme with regard to the programme aim. The findings also highlight the feasibility and appropriateness of the programme in terms of an innovative teaching proposal.", "To study the prevalence of epilepsy and Inter-ictal epileptiform discharges (IED) in children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the factors associated with occurrence of epilepsy in these children.\nChildren between 6 and 12 y attending the Child Development Centre of a tertiary-care institute in India were evaluated for ASD and ADHD as per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5). Childhood Autism Rating Scale was used to assess ASD severity,\u00a0and Conner's Rating Scales were used to sub-classify children with ADHD. Intelligence quotient was assessed if not assessed in the previous 1 y. History of seizures was taken, and electroencephalography was done in all children. Epilepsy was diagnosed and classified according to International League Against Epilepsy.\nOf the 130 children enrolled (90 ASD, 40 ADHD), 56 (43%) had epilepsy and 55 (42.3%) had IED. The proportion of both epilepsy and IED was higher among ASD (both 45.5%) as compared to ADHD (37.5% and 35%), although not statistically significant. Among children with ASD, epilepsy was common in those with severe ASD (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and IED were more common in those with IQ <80 (P\u2009=\u20090.047). There were no significant differences between occurrence of epilepsy/IED and subtypes of ADHD.\nThe high prevalence of epilepsy and IED among children with ASD and ADHD emphasizes the need for guidelines for identifying and diagnosing epilepsy in this group. This will\u00a0ensure appropriate management and improve patient outcomes.", "Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Early detection is of utmost importance as there is abundant evidence that early treatment prevents disease progression, preserves vision, and improves patients' long-term quality of life. The structure and function thresholds that alert to the diagnosis of glaucoma can be obtained entirely via digital means, and as such, screening is well suited to benefit from artificial intelligence and specifically machine learning. This paper reviews the concepts and current literature on the use of machine learning for detection of the glaucomatous disc and visual field.", "In this study, we introduced a novel hybrid artificial intelligence approach of rotation forest (RF) as a Meta/ensemble classifier based on alternating decision tree (ADTree) as a base classifier called RF-ADTree in order to spatially predict gully erosion at Klocheh watershed of Kurdistan province, Iran. A total of 915 gully erosion locations along with 22 gully conditioning factors were used to construct a database. Some soft computing benchmark models (SCBM) including the ADTree, the Support Vector Machine by two kernel functions such as Polynomial and Radial Base Function (SVM-Polynomial and SVM-RBF), the Logistic Regression (LR), and the Na\u00efve Bayes Multinomial Updatable (NBMU) models were used for comparison of the designed model. Results indicated that 19 conditioning factors were effective among which distance to river, geomorphology, land use, hydrological group, lithology and slope angle were the most remarkable factors for gully modeling process. Additionally, results of modeling concluded the RF-ADTree ensemble model could significantly improve (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.906) the prediction accuracy of the ADTree model (AUC = 0.882). The new proposed model had also the highest performance (AUC = 0.913) in comparison to the SVM-Polynomial model (AUC = 0.879), the SVM-RBF model (AUC = 0.867), the LR model (AUC = 0.75), the ADTree model (AUC = 0.861) and the NBMU model (AUC = 0.811).", "People's emotional experiences depend not only on what actually happened, but also on what they thought would happen. However, these expectations about future outcomes are not always communicated explicitly. Thus, the ability to infer others' expectations in context and understand how these expectations influence others' emotions is an important aspect of our social intelligence. Prior work suggests that an abstract understanding of how expectations modulate emotional responses may not emerge until 7 to 8 years of age. Using a novel paradigm that capitalizes on intuitive physics to generate contextually plausible expectations, we present evidence for expectation-based emotion inference in preschool-aged children. Given two bowlers who experienced identical final outcomes (hitting 3 of 6 pins), we varied the trajectory of their balls such that one would initially expect to hit all pins (high-expectation), while the other would expect to hit none (low-expectation). In Experiment 1, both 4- and 5-year-olds appropriately adjusted characters' happiness ratings upward (low-expectation) or downward (high-expectation) relative to their initial emotions; however, only 5-year-olds made adjustments robust enough to manifest as higher final ratings for the low-expectation than the high-expectation character. In Experiments 2-3, we replicate these results and show that 5-year-olds reliably differentiate the characters' emotions even when their expectations must be inferred from context. An internal meta-analysis revealed a robust and consistent effect across the three experiments. Together, these findings provide the earliest evidence for expectation-based emotion reasoning and suggest that the ability to spontaneously generate and consider others' expectations continues to develop during preschool years.

Health care systems of every country are designed in such a way to encourage patients to first attempt to get care at the primary level and then to approach a higher level of care according to the need. This protocol minimizes the costs for the caretaker/patients. However, in most of the countries, patients often bypass primary care facilities and directly go to the higher center thereby, increasing the burden on higher level facilities, the picture is not very different in India also. Health care system in India is plugged by: overpopulation, lack of expert clinicians, skewed distribution of physicians, lack of motivation among existing health care personnel and an ineffective referral mechanism. Due to failure of conventional paper-based referral systems in our country, we can introduce an e-referral system in the era of internet. It is evident from our experiences, that this artificial intelligence enabled e-referral system has many advantages over the traditional paper-based referral system. It will aid health workers for timely management of cases. Most importantly, it will streamline the existing unorganized referral process. Although, for effective e-Referral system, there should be a collaborative platform where easy search and discovery for health care providers is possible and help in decision making. e- Referral should be incorporated in our health system to strengthen it by bridging the access gap may be through Public Private Partnership model.", "\"The majority of hernias can be satisfactorily repaired by using the tissues at hand. The use of mesh prosthesis should be restricted to those few hernias in which tension or lack of good fascial structures prevents a secure primary repair. This group includes large direct inguinal hernias and incisional hernias in which the defect is too large to close primarily without undue tension. Most recurrent hernias, because of this factor are best repaired with mesh prosthesis\". These words, penned in 1960 by Francis Usher have reconfirmed what had been a mantra of the Shouldice Hospital (Usher in 81:847-854, 1960). The Shouldice Hospital has specialized in the treatment of abdominal wall hernias since 1945. It has, since its beginning, insisted on the fact that a thorough knowledge of anatomy coupled with large volumes of surgical cases would lead to unparalleled expertise. It was Cicero who taught us that \"Practice, not intelligence or dexterity, will win the day\"! Since the seminal contribution of Bassini (1844-1924), there have been no less than 80 procedures imitating his inguinal herniorrhaphy and much more since the introduction of mesh and mesh devices (Iason in Hernia. The Blakiston Company, Philadelphia, pp 475-604, 1940). All have failed to some extent and it appears that the common denominator for these failures was the inability to understand the importance of entering the preperitoneal space. Only Shouldice and McVay (Lotheissen, Narath) realized the shortcoming and have continued to thrive as a successful procedure. Entering the preperitoneal space eliminates any temptation to plicate the posterior inguinal wall, a layer normally deficient in direct inguinal hernias, but it also allows the identification of muscle layers rectus, transversus and internal oblique muscles which will go to reconstruct the posterior inguinal wall, without tension as reported by Schumpelick (Junge in 7(1):17-20, 2003).", "Artificial intelligence (AI) - the ability of a machine to perform cognitive tasks to\u00a0achieve a particular goal based on provided data - is revolutionizing and reshaping our health-care systems. The current availability of ever-increasing computational power, highly developed pattern recognition algorithms and advanced image processing software working at\u00a0very high speeds has led to the emergence of computer-based systems that are trained to perform complex tasks in bioinformatics, medical imaging and medical robotics. Accessibility to\u00a0'big data' enables the 'cognitive' computer to scan billions of bits of unstructured information, extract the relevant information and recognize complex patterns with increasing confidence. Computer-based decision-support systems based on machine learning (ML) have the potential to revolutionize medicine by performing complex tasks that are currently assigned to specialists to improve diagnostic accuracy, increase efficiency of throughputs, improve clinical workflow, decrease human resource costs and improve treatment choices. These characteristics could be especially helpful in the management of prostate cancer, with growing applications in diagnostic imaging, surgical interventions, skills training and assessment, digital pathology and genomics. Medicine must adapt to this changing world, and urologists, oncologists, radiologists and pathologists, as high-volume users of imaging and pathology, need to understand this burgeoning science and acknowledge that the development of highly accurate AI-based decision-support applications\u00a0of\u00a0ML will require collaboration between data scientists, computer researchers and engineers.", "The way we categorise and classify cancer types dictates not only the way we diagnose and treat patients\u00a0but also many of our decisions on biomarker and drug development.

The purpose of drug drug interaction (DDI) extraction is to automatically obtain the interaction between drugs from biomedical literature. Current state-of-the-art approaches for DDI extraction task are based on artificial intelligence and natural language processing. While such existing DDI extraction methods can provide more knowledge and enhance the performance through external resources such as biomedical databases or ontologies, due to the difficulty of updating, these external resources are delayed. In fact, user generated content (UGC) is another kind of external medical resources that can be quickly updated. We are trying to use UGC resources to provide more available information for our deep learning DDI extraction method. In this paper, we present a DDI extraction approach through a new attention mechanism called full-attention which can combine the UGC information with contextual information. We conducted a series of experiments on the DDI 2013 Evaluation dataset to evaluate our method. Experiments show improved performance compared with the state of the art and UGC-DDI model achieves a competitive F-score of 0.712.", "A cross-sectional analysis of the Neurological, cOgnitive and VIsual performance in hiv-infected Children cohort showed significant cognitive impairment in combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-treated, perinatally human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adolescents (PHIV+) compared to age-, sex-, ethnicity- and socioeconomic status (SES)-matched HIV-negative controls (HIV-). In this longitudinal study, we compared cognitive development in the same adolescents over time.\nWe repeated the standardized cognitive test battery after a mean of 4.6 years (standard deviation 0.3). In participants who completed both assessments, we compared cognitive trajectories between groups in the domains of intelligence quotient (IQ), processing speed, working memory, executive functioning, learning ability, and visual-motor function, using linear mixed models. We explored associations with disease- and treatment-related factors and used multivariate normative comparison (MNC) to determine the prevalence of cognitive impairment.\nThere were 21 PHIV+ and 23 HIV- participants that completed 2 assessments and were similar concerning age, sex, ethnicity, and SES. Compared to HIV- participants, in PHIV+ participants the IQ score increased significantly more over time (group*time 6.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-10.50; P = .012), whereas executive functioning decreased significantly more (group*time -1.43 z score, 95% CI -2.12 to -0.75; P < .001), resulting in the disappearance and appearance of significant differences. Processing speed, working memory, learning ability, and visual-motor function trajectories were not statistically different between groups. Univariately, those who had started cART at an older age deviated more in executive functioning (-0.13 z score, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.02; P = .043). The prevalence of cognitive impairments by MNC was similar in both groups, at both time points.\nThe cART-treated PHIV+ adolescents appeared to have similar global cognitive development, compared to their healthy peers. Executive functioning trajectory appears to deviate, potentially explained by earlier brain damage.", "The ripples of artificial intelligence are being felt in various sectors of human life. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, extracts information from large databases of information and is gaining traction in various fields of cardiology. In this review, we highlight noteworthy examples of machine learning utilization in echocardiography, nuclear cardiology, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging over the past year.\nIn the past year, machine learning (ML) has expanded its boundaries in cardiology with several positive results. Some studies have integrated clinical and imaging information to further augment the accuracy of these ML algorithms. All the studies mentioned in this review have clearly demonstrated superior results of ML in relation to conventional approaches for identifying obstructions or predicting major adverse events in reference to conventional approaches. As the influx of data arriving from gradually evolving technologies in health care and wearable devices continues to be more complex, ML may serve as the bridge to transcend the gap between health care and patients in the future. In order to facilitate a seamless transition between both, a few issues must be resolved for a successful implementation of ML in health care.", "Livestock are critical component for supporting the sustainable agriculture in the current global scenario.

In light of literature on the sociotechnical dimensions of the life sciences and biotechnology and literature on former bioweapons programs, this article argues that we need more detailed empirical case studies of the social and technical factors shaping CRISPR and related gene-editing techniques in order to better understand how they may be different from other advances in biotechnology-or whether similar features remain. This information will be critical to better inform intelligence practitioners and policymakers about the security implications of new gene-editing techniques.", "Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) exemplifies a population-level data source for generating real-world evidence to support clinical decisions and health care policy-making. Like with all claims databases, there have been some validity concerns of studies using the NHIRD, such as the accuracy of diagnosis codes and issues around unmeasured confounders. Endeavors to validate diagnosed codes or to develop methodologic approaches to address unmeasured confounders have largely increased the reliability of NHIRD studies. Recently, Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) established a Health and Welfare Data Center (HWDC), a data repository site that centralizes the NHIRD and about 70 other health-related databases for data management and analyses. To strengthen the protection of data privacy, investigators are required to conduct on-site analysis at an HWDC through remote connection to MOHW servers. Although the tight regulation of this on-site analysis has led to inconvenience for analysts and has increased time and costs required for research, the HWDC has created opportunities for enriched dimensions of study by linking across the NHIRD and other databases. In the near future, researchers will have greater opportunity to distill knowledge from the NHIRD linked to hospital-based electronic medical records databases containing unstructured patient-level information by using artificial intelligence techniques, including machine learning and natural language processes. We believe that NHIRD with multiple data sources could represent a powerful research engine with enriched dimensions and could serve as a guiding light for real-world evidence-based medicine in Taiwan.", "As many as half of school children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), resulting in marked negative academic, social, and behavioral outcomes. The focus of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on real-world data from novel digital sources, and the emergence of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to reimburse for digital monitoring and neurobehavioral testing suggest an increasing acceptance of the role of technology in augmenting clinical care and research. Empowered Brain is an augmented reality and artificial intelligence-based social-emotional communication aid for students with ASD. In this study, student performance on Empowered Brain is correlated to validated clinical measures of ADHD. Seven high school students with a diagnosis of ASD were recruited from a public high school. All students were assessed for severity of ADHD-related symptoms via three clinical gold-standard assessments, namely the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2), and Teacher Report Form (TRF). Students used Empowered Brain over a one-week period. We measured the correlation of student in-game performance (as measured by point- and star-based rewards) relative to the hyperactivity subscale of the ABC (ABC-H), and the ADHD-subscale of the TRF. All seven students completed the study and managed to successfully use Empowered Brain. Students received a culminative total of 32 sessions, an average of 4.6 sessions per student (range 2-8). Student in-game performance demonstrated highly significant correlation relative to ABC-H (points: p = 0.0013; stars: p = 0.0013)., and significant correlation to TRF ADHD scores (points: p = 0.012; stars: p = 0.012). No adverse effects were noted among students who used Empowered Brain. New technologies may herald novel ways of identifying and characterizing symptoms of ADHD in student populations. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain in-game performance correlates with ADHD symptom severity in students with ASD. Larger samples are required to validate these findings, with more diverse participants that can also widen the generalizability of these findings to a broader range of brain conditions that manifest with inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Through further research, we may find that such technologies can help us to identify and longitudinally monitor such symptoms, and potentially aid in severity stratification and digital phenotyping.", "The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon was developed to standardize mammographic reporting to assess cancer risk and facilitate the decision to biopsy. Because of substantial interobserver variability in the application of the BI-RADS lexicon, the decision to biopsy varies greatly and results in overdiagnosis and excessive biopsies. The false-positive rate from mammograms is estimated to be 7% to approximately 10% overall, but within the BI-RADS 4 category, it is greater than 70%. Therefore, we developed the Breast Cancer Risk Calculator (BRISK) to target a well-characterized and specific patient subgroup (BI-RADS 4) rather than a broad heterogeneous group in assessing breast cancer risk.\nBRISK provides a novel precise risk assessment model to reduce overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies. It was developed by applying natural language processing and deep learning methods on 5,147 patient records archived in the Houston Methodist systemwide data warehouse from 2006 to May 2015, including imaging and pathology reports, mammographic images, and patient demographics. Key characteristics for BI-RADS 4 patients were collected and computed to output an index measure for biopsy recommendation that is clinically relevant and informative and improves upon the traditional BI-RADS 4 scores.\nFor the validation set, we assessed data from 1,247 BI-RADS 4 patients, including mammographic images and medical reports. The BRISK model sensitivity to predict malignancy was 100%, whereas the specificity was 74%. The total accuracy of our implemented model in BRISK was 81%. Overall area under the curve was 0.93.\nBRISK for abnormal mammogram uses integrative artificial intelligence technology and has demonstrated high sensitivity in the prediction of malignancy. Prospective evaluation is under way and can lead to improvement in patient-physician engagement in making informed decisions with regard to biopsy.", "Patients with schizophrenia are often described as impaired in several cognitive domains. Specifically, patients with schizophrenia often exhibit problems in solving tasks requiring theory of mind (ToM), i.e., the ability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others, communicative-pragmatic ability, i.e., the ability to use language and non-verbal expressive means to convey meaning in a given context, and executive functions (EF). This study aims to investigate the role of cognitive functions, such as general intelligence, selective attention, processing speed, and especially EF (working memory, cognitive flexibility, inhibition, and planning), and ToM in explaining the performance of individual with schizophrenia in comprehending and producing communicative acts expressed with different communicative intentions (i.e., sincere, deceitful, and ironic), and realized through linguistic and extralinguistic/non-verbal expressive means. Thirty-two patients with schizophrenia and an equal number of healthy controls performed tasks aiming to investigate their capacity to comprehend and produce sincere, deceitful, and ironic communicative acts in addition to a series of cognitive tasks evaluating EF and ToM. The results indicated that individuals with schizophrenia performed worse than the controls in the comprehension and production of all pragmatic phenomena investigated, as well as in all the cognitive functions examined. The patients with schizophrenia also exhibited an increasing trend of difficulty in comprehending and producing sincere, deceitful, and ironic communicative acts expressed through either linguistic or extralinguistic means. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis of the patients' performance on the pragmatic tasks revealed that overall, the role of attention, general intelligence, and processing speed did not appear to significantly explain the patients' communicative-pragmatic performance. The inclusion of EF into the analysis did not contribute to increase the explained variance of the patients' ability to comprehend and produce the various pragmatic phenomena investigated. Only the addition of ToM could significantly increase the explained variance, but only in the comprehension and production of deceit expressed by language and the production of sincere communicative acts, also limited to linguistic production. We conclude that neither EF nor ToM are able to explain the decreasing trend detected in the patients' pragmatic performance.", "Self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) is facilitated by application available to analyze these data. They are mainly based on descriptive statistical analyses. In this study, we are proposing a method inspired by artificial intelligence algorithm for displaying glycemic data in an intelligible way with high-level information that is compatible with the short duration allocated to medical visits.\nWe propose a display method based on a numerical glycemic data conversion using a qualitative color scale that exhibits the patient's overall glycemic state. Moreover, a machine learning algorithm inputs these displays to exhibit recurrent glycemic pattern over configurable extended time period.\nA demonstrator of our method, output as a glycemic map, could be used by the physician during quarterly patient consultations. We have tested this methodology retrospectively on a database in order to observe the behavior of our algorithm. In some data files we were able to highlight some of the glycemic patterns characteristics that remain invisible on the tabular representations or through the use of descriptive statistic. In a next step the interpretation will have to be done by physicians to confirm they underlie knowledge.\nOur approach with artificial intelligence algorithm paired up with graphical color display allow a large database fast analysis to provide insights on diabetes knowledge. The next steps are first to set up a clinical trial to validate this methodology with dedicated patients and physicians then we will adapt our methodology for the huge data sets generated by continuous glycemic measurement (CGM) devices.", "Cancer and its surgical treatment are among the most important triggering events for persistent pain, but additional factors need to be present for the clinical manifestation, such as variants in pain-relevant genes. In a cohort of 140 women undergoing breast cancer surgery, assigned based on a 3-year follow-up to either a persistent or nonpersistent pain phenotype, next-generation sequencing was performed for 77 genes selected for known functional involvement in persistent pain. Applying machine-learning and item categorization techniques, 21 variants in 13 different genes were found to be relevant to the assignment of a patient to either the persistent pain or the nonpersistent pain phenotype group. In descending order of importance for correct group assignment, the relevant genes comprised DRD1, FAAH, GCH1, GPR132, OPRM1, DRD3, RELN, GABRA5, NF1, COMT, TRPA1, ABHD6, and DRD4, of which one in the DRD4 gene was a novel discovery. Particularly relevant variants were found in the DRD1 and GPR132 genes, or in a cis-eCTL position of the OPRM1 gene. Supervised machine-learning-based classifiers, trained with 2/3 of the data, identified the correct pain phenotype group in the remaining 1/3 of the patients at accuracies and areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves of 65% to 72%. When using conservative classical statistical approaches, none of the variants passed \u03b1-corrected testing. The present data analysis approach, using machine learning and training artificial intelligences, provided biologically plausible results and outperformed classical approaches to genotype-phenotype association.", "Lower-grade gliomas (LGGs) are often observed within eloquent regions, which indicates that tumor resection in these areas carries a potential risk for neurological disturbances, such as motor deficit, language disorder, and/or neurocognitive impairments. Some patients with frontal tumors exhibit severe impairments of neurocognitive function, including working memory and spatial awareness, after tumor removal. The aim of this study was to investigate neurocognitive and functional outcomes of frontal LGGs in both the dominant and nondominant hemispheres after awake brain mapping.\nData from 50 consecutive patients with diffuse frontal LGGs in the dominant and nondominant hemispheres who underwent awake brain surgery between December 2012 and September 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. The goal was to map neurocognitive functions such as working memory by using working memory tasks, including digit span testing and N-back tasks.\nDue to awake language mapping, the frontal aslant tract was frequently identified as a functional boundary in patients with left superior frontal gyrus tumors (76.5%). Furthermore, functional boundaries were identified while evaluating verbal and spatial working memory function by stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using the digit span and visual N-back tasks in patients with right superior frontal gyrus tumors (7.1%). Comparing the preoperative and postoperative neuropsychological assessments from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), significant improvement following awake surgery was observed in mean Perceptual Organization (Z = -2.09, p = 0.04) in WAIS-III scores. Postoperative mean WMS-R scores for Visual Memory (Z = -2.12, p = 0.03) and Delayed Recall (Z = -1.98, p = 0.04) were significantly improved compared with preoperative values for every test after awake surgery. No significant deterioration was noted with regard to neurocognitive functions in a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. In the postoperative course, early transient speech and motor disturbances were observed in 30.0% and 28.0% of patients, respectively. In contrast, late permanent speech and motor disturbances were observed in 0% and 4.0%, respectively.\nIt is noteworthy that no significant postoperative deterioration was identified compared with preoperative status in a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. The results demonstrated that awake functional mapping enabled favorable neurocognitive and functional outcomes after surgery in patients with diffuse frontal LGGs.", "Machine learning (ML) allows the exploration and progressive improvement of very complex high-dimensional data patterns that can be utilised to optimise specific classification and prediction tasks, outperforming traditional statistical approaches. An enormous acceleration of ready-to-use tools and artificial intelligence (AI) applications, shaped by the emergence, refinement, and application of powerful ML algorithms in several areas of knowledge, is ongoing. Although such progress has begun to permeate the medical sciences and clinical medicine, implementation in cardiovascular medicine and research is still in its infancy.\nTo lay out the theoretical framework, purpose, and structure of a\u00a0novel AI consortium.\nWe have established a\u00a0new Dutch research consortium, the CVON-AI, supported by the Netherlands Heart Foundation, to catalyse and facilitate the development and utilisation of AI solutions for existing and emerging cardiovascular research initiatives and to raise AI awareness in the cardiovascular research community. CVON-AI will connect to previously established CVON consortia and apply a\u00a0cloud-based AI platform to supplement their planned traditional data-analysis approach.\nA\u00a0pilot experiment on the CVON-AI cloud was conducted using cardiac magnetic resonance data. It demonstrated the feasibility of the platform and documented excellent correlation between AI-generated ventricular function estimates as compared to expert manual annotations. The resulting AI solution was then integrated in a\u00a0web application.\nCVON-AI is a\u00a0new consortium meant to facilitate the implementation and raise awareness of AI in cardiovascular research in the Netherlands. CVON-AI will create an accessible cloud-based platform for cardiovascular researchers, demonstrate the clinical applicability of AI, optimise the analytical methodology of other ongoing CVON consortia, and promote AI awareness through education and training.", "Learning a second language in childhood is inherently advantageous for communication. However, parents, educators and scientists have been interested in determining whether there are additional cognitive advantages. One of the most exciting yet controversial1 findings about bilinguals is a reported advantage for executive function. That is, several studies suggest that bilinguals perform better than monolinguals on tasks assessing cognitive abilities that are central to the voluntary control of thoughts and behaviours-the so-called 'executive functions' (for example, attention, inhibitory control, task switching and resolving conflict). Although a number of small-2-4 and large-sample5,6 studies have reported a bilingual executive function advantage (see refs. 7-9 for a review), there have been several failures to replicate these findings10-15, and recent meta-analyses have called into question the reliability of the original empirical claims8,9. Here we show, in a very large, demographically representative sample (n\u2009=\u20094,524) of 9- to 10-year-olds across the United States, that there is little evidence for a bilingual advantage for inhibitory control, attention and task switching, or cognitive flexibility, which are key aspects of executive function. We also replicate previously reported disadvantages in English vocabulary in bilinguals7,16,17. However, these English vocabulary differences are substantially mitigated when we account for individual differences in socioeconomic status or intelligence. In summary, notwithstanding the inherently positive benefits of learning a second language in childhood18, we found little evidence that it engenders additional benefits to executive function development.", "Driven by recent developments in computational power, algorithms and web-based storage resources, machine learning (ML)-based artificial intelligence (AI) has quickly gained ground as the solution for many technological and societal challenges. AI education has become very popular and is oversubscribed at Dutch universities. Major investments were made in 2018 to develop and build the first AI-driven hospitals to improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs. AI has the potential to greatly enhance traditional statistical analyses in many domains and has been demonstrated to allow the discovery of 'hidden' information in highly complex datasets. As such, AI can also be of significant value in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease, and the first applications of AI in the cardiovascular field are promising. However, many professionals in the cardiovascular field involved in patient care, education or science are unaware of the basics behind AI and the existing and expected applications in their field. In this review, we aim to introduce the broad cardiovascular community to the basics of modern ML-based AI and explain several of the commonly used algorithms. We also summarise their initial and future applications relevant to the cardiovascular field.", "Healthcare is a living system that generates a significant volume of heterogeneous data. As healthcare systems are pivoting to value-based systems, intelligent and interactive analysis of health data is gaining significance for health system management, especially for resource optimization whilst improving care quality and health outcomes. Health data analytics is being influenced by new concepts and intelligent methods emanating from artificial intelligence and big data. In this article, we contextualize health data and health data analytics in terms of the emerging trends of artificial intelligence and big data. We examine the nature of health data using the big data criterion to understand \"how big\" is health data. Next, we explain the working of artificial intelligence-based data analytics methods and discuss \"what insights\" can be derived from a broad spectrum of health data analytics methods to improve health system management, health outcomes, knowledge discovery, and healthcare innovation.", "Reinforcement learning in multiagent systems has been studied in the fields of economic game theory, artificial intelligence, and statistical physics by developing an analytical understanding of the learning dynamics (often in relation to the replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory). However, the majority of these analytical studies focuses on repeated normal form games, which only have a single environmental state. Environmental dynamics, i.e., changes in the state of an environment affecting the agents' payoffs has received less attention, lacking a universal method to obtain deterministic equations from established multistate reinforcement learning algorithms. In this work we present a methodological extension, separating the interaction from the adaptation timescale, to derive the deterministic limit of a general class of reinforcement learning algorithms, called temporal difference learning. This form of learning is equipped to function in more realistic multistate environments by using the estimated value of future environmental states to adapt the agent's behavior. We demonstrate the potential of our method with the three well-established learning algorithms Q learning, SARSA learning, and actor-critic learning. Illustrations of their dynamics on two multiagent, multistate environments reveal a wide range of different dynamical regimes, such as convergence to fixed points, limit cycles, and even deterministic chaos.", "Various evidence-based and student-centered strategies such as team-based learning (TBL), case-based learning (CBL), and flipped classroom have been recently applied to anatomy education and have shown to improve student engagement and interaction. These strategies shift the focus of teaching from knowledge transmission to knowledge construction by students and encourage the use of tasks. This study discusses the use of an active and engaging learning strategy to teach the musculoskeletal system to Year 1 MBBS students (Faculty of Medical Sciences, The University of the West Indies, Cave Hill, Barbados) and examines the correlation between assessment modalities and student performance.\nThe \"Active and Engaging Learning Strategy\" was used to assess student learning in the form of oral presentations. Students had presentations on muscle attachments, muscle actions, blood and nerve supply, and applied anatomy of the limb musculature. Questions on the limbs (Locomotor System) were included in pre and post-presentation spotters, in-course assessments, and final examinations. Percentages, paired t-test, independent sample t-test, and zero-order correlations were performed to confirm the results for the different objectives of the study.\nThe main modes of presentation chosen were poems (37.1%), followed by stories (21.2%), songs (11.4%), and skits (10.6%). The majority of students (84%) found the strategies beneficial and recommended such sessions for future cohorts (92%). Students achieved significantly better scores in post-presentation spotters (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and the marks of in-course and final examinations also showed significant improvement (p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nOur study highlighted that the active and engaging learning strategy can be used as an effective learning tool in anatomy. Students were proactive in preparing the muscle presentations by utilizing their own creativity, curiosity, and intelligence. Further studies should be conducted using randomized controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of various learning strategies which could open a new door to medical education.", "Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a drug used against a wide variety of tumors, which can cause severe toxicity, possibly leading to the delay or suspension of the cycle, with the consequent impact on the prognosis of survival. The main goal of this work is to predict the toxicities derived from CPT-11 using artificial intelligence methods. The data for this study is conformed of 53 cycles of FOLFIRINOX, corresponding to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Supported by several demographic data, blood markers and pharmacokinetic parameters resulting from a non-compartmental pharmacokinetic study of CPT-11 and its metabolites (SN-38 and SN-38-G), we use machine learning techniques to predict high degrees of different toxicities (leukopenia, neutropenia and diarrhea) in new patients. We predict high degree of leukopenia with an accuracy of 76%, neutropenia with 75% and diarrhea with 91%. Among other variables, this study shows that the areas under the curve of CPT-11, SN-38 and SN-38-G play a relevant role in the prediction of the studied toxicities. The presented models allow to predict the degree of toxicity for each cycle of treatment according to the particularities of each patient.", "The International Work Conference on Bioinspired Intelligence (IWOBI) is an annual event that comprises both an international peer-reviewed scientific conference and a set of workshops and other activities in order to foster the research abilities and expertise of young researchers in the field of bioinspired intelligence. IWOBI 2018 has been characterized by a strong transdisciplinary component. The main conference themes were at the intersection between classical engineering disciplines and computer science, and the life and health sciences. This was motivated by the scientific environment that defines research that is being conducted in Costa Rica. Even though IWOBI is an international event, it was very important for the local organizing committee to focus on knowledge areas that were considered of special interest to Costa Rican researchers and to students looking to start their scientific careers. With such great expectations, IWOBI 2018 has been the first IWOBI conference in history to have parallel tracks. In addition to a regular track, a biocomputation and related techniques track was developed, as well as another one devoted to high-performance computing (HPC) systems applications for life and health sciences applications. Workshops were another important resource developed within IWOBI 2018. They were considered a very important tool in order to foster and train young researchers within the country and they are a very valuable chance to establish direct networking with elite researchers from different countries and research interests. IWOBI 2018 was the first IWOBI conference that implemented real and effective workshops. There were two workshops, one of them devoted to COPASI software and the other one focused on the use of the message passing interface (MPI) parallel programming library.", "Brain iron load is one of the main neuropathologic hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies indicated that iron in the substantia nigra (SN) is related to disease duration and motor impairment. We explore, through a cross-sectional study, the association between brain iron distribution, evaluated by T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2*), and clinical features in a cohort of patients with PD. Thirty-two patients with PD, compared with 10 control subjects, were evaluated for motor and cognitive features (attention and working memory, executive functions, language, memory, and visuospatial function). They underwent a magnetic resonance imaging protocol including T2* analysis of specific brain regions of interest to measure iron load compared with healthy control subjects. We found that iron content of the SN correlated positively with both disease duration and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III off score. Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Spatial Span, and Graded Naming Test scores were inversely associated with iron load of the SN, whereas Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV Similarities score showed an inverse relationship with iron content in all the regions of interest examined. Our findings suggest a relationship between topographic brain iron distribution and cognitive domain impairment.", "Goldenhar syndrome is a multiple congenital disorder with classic characteristics regarding the face, eyes, ears. The incidence of this case is between 1:3.500 to 1:5.600. Early detection and good management can have good outcomes. A newborn with this condition can have a normal life and intelligence.\nA baby girl was born spontaneously at Wangaya General Hospital with APGAR minutes 1, 5, and 10 scores respectively 3, 5, and 8. Infant birth weight was 2.600 grams, body length was 47 cm, and head circumference was 31 cm with estimated age 32-34 weeks. Clinically showing an asymmetrical face, mouth toward the right side without hypoplasia, the eyelids appear asymmetrical with the right eyelid not open when the left eyelid is open, and the two ears not fully formed and diagnosed as Goldenhar Syndrome. From the physical examination, the ear canal is not formed, intact palate, normal eyeball no abnormalities in the spine and found murmur during the systolic-diastolic phase of the heart. Evaluation of the function of vision and hearing has not been concluded. Abdominal ultrasound showed first-degree picture of bilateral hydronephrosis, and from echocardiography, a PDA was found. TORCH profiles in infant were positive for IgG anti-CMV, IgG anti-rubella, and IgG anti-HSV 1. The prognosis, in this case, is good and periodic evaluation needs to be done in 6 months.\nMultidisciplinary examination and management, in this case, are needed so that appropriate therapeutic planning can be carried out as well as periodic evaluations in monitoring the child's growth and development.", "Recent recommendations characterize deliveries at 37+0 \u00a0weeks through 38+6 \u00a0weeks as early term. We aimed to review the literature systematically on long-term cognition, school performance and behavior in children born early term (37+0 to 38+6 weeks) compared with full term (39+0 \u00a0to 40+6 weeks).\nThe review was performed according to the PRISMA Statement. The final literature search was performed on 31 January 2019. We located studies in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials, cohort studies and case-control studies, with outcome assessment performed at 2-19 years. We collected information using a structured data form and evaluated study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).\nWe included 42 observational studies published between 2006 and 2018. No restriction on year of publication was made. The mean NOS score was 5.8 with a range from 3 to 9. Compared with children born full term, children born early term had a lower intelligence score in early adulthood and up to some 30% increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Furthermore, we found some 10%-40% increased risk of cognitive problems, some 25% higher risk of language impairments and another 8%-75% with poorer overall school performance. No meta-analysis was conducted due to heterogeneity in the outcome measures. Only 10 studies presented subgroup analyses in spontaneous deliveries or adjusted for type of labor onset/induction.\nChildren born early term are at increased risk of cognitive deficits, poorer school performance and behavioral problems compared with children born full term.", "Many new technologies based on computer technologies which are very successful in industry spread over the medicine and became integral part of all its disciplines. Artificial intelligence opened new possibilities for managing and solving many problems in both - theoretical and practical health care. The capability of these new technologies to extract tiny interactions of different items has been appreciated especially in treatment complex diseases. They are capable to analyze not only enormous amounts of data (big data) in an extremely short time but also these processes of analyses are easily improved by machine itself (machine learning). Examples of AI application in several medical disciplines and itinerary for Electronic Health Records adoption in the Czech health care are listed.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised as a transformational force in healthcare. This paper presents a current environmental scan, through the eyes of primary care physicians, of the top ten ways AI will impact primary care and its key stakeholders. We discuss ten distinct problem spaces and the most promising AI innovations in each, estimating potential market sizes and the Quadruple Aims that are most likely to be affected. Primary care is where the power, opportunity, and future of AI are most likely to be realized in the broadest and most ambitious scale. We propose how these AI-powered innovations must augment, not subvert, the patient-physician relationship for physicians and patients to accept them. AI implemented poorly risks pushing humanity to the margins; done wisely, AI can free up physicians' cognitive and emotional space for patients, and shift the focus away from transactional tasks to personalized care. The challenge will be for humans to have the wisdom and willingness to discern AI's optimal role in twenty-first century healthcare, and to determine when it strengthens and when it undermines human healing. Ongoing research will determine the impact of AI technologies in achieving better care, better health, lower costs, and improved well-being of the workforce.", "The last years' developments could show that the rehabilitation with hearing implants is a field with the highest potential for development and innovation in otorhinolaryngology. New or extended indications were seen with developments of implants, new surgical techniques, and respective rehabilitation strategies.With the background of limited resources, the increasing number of subjects suffering from hearing disorders, the extended indications and thus the increasing number of CI carriers as well as the need of life-long CI follow-up are one of the major challenges of the future. In order to cope with this situation, completely new strategies are required beside a close interdisciplinary cooperation and continuous development of the therapy. In this context, digitization of all these processes plays a key role.This manuscript will describe and discuss the current developments from the perspective of a cochlea implant (CI) providing hospital. The contribution will elucidate manifold digital applications that may be implemented in all phases of CI provision, starting with patient information about the possibilities of hearing screening and preoperative evaluation up to life-long follow-up and clinical research.The focus is mainly placed on specific applications that play a particular role in the development of digital progresses and structures in the context of cochlea implantation and that are crucial for understanding the further development.The options of simplified fitting result for example from automated MAP creation (artificial intelligence); remote care networks (telemedicine, apps) foster the active contribution of the patients themselves and allow completely new types of location-independent healthcare (automated technical implant control, individual settings, upgrades). Central databases may create backups of the current MAP (for example in cases of repair), and document technical data and the hearing performance. Some applications described here, are already implemented in the routine, others are currently being developed.Understanding the possibilities of digitization and their implementation in the context of hearing rehabilitation with hearing implants as well as the recognition of the enormous potential for effective, time-efficient structures is essential in order to use this potential. We as ENT specialists are important protagonists in the healthcare system and beside our high specific expertise we have to meet the requirements of our qualification with regard to digital applications so that we might actively contribute to the success of this process.\nDie Entwicklungen der letzten Jahre haben gezeigt, dass die Rehabilitation mit H\u00f6rimplantaten in der HNO-Heilkunde ein Bereich mit h\u00f6chstem Entwicklungs- und Innovationspotenzial ist. Neue, bzw. erweiterte Indikationen gingen dabei einher mit Entwicklungen im Bereich der Implantate, neuen OP-Techniken und entsprechend angepassten Rehabilitationsstrategien.Die wachsende Anzahl von Menschen mit H\u00f6rst\u00f6rungen, die erweiterten Indikationen und die daraus resultierende steigende Anzahl CI-Versorgter, sowie die Notwendigkeit der lebenslangen CI Nachsorge sind vor dem Hintergrund begrenzter Ressourcen eine gro\u00dfe Herausforderung. Um diese zu bew\u00e4ltigen und zu gestalten, bedarf es neben einer engen interdisziplin\u00e4ren Zusammenarbeit und kontinuierlichen Weiterentwicklung der Therapie auch ganz neuer Strategien. Hier kommt der Digitalisierung all dieser Prozesse eine Schl\u00fcsselrolle zu.In diesem Referat werden die aktuellen Entwicklungen aus dem Blickwinkel einer Cochlea-Implantat (CI) versorgenden Klinik dargestellt und besprochen. Das Referat illustriert vielf\u00e4ltige digitale Anwendungen, die in allen Phasen der CI Versorgung zum Einsatz kommen k\u00f6nnen, angefangen von der Patienteninformation \u00fcber M\u00f6glichkeiten des H\u00f6r-Screenings und die pr\u00e4operative Evaluation bis zur lebenslangen Nachsorge und der klinischen Forschung.Hierbei liegt der Fokus auf speziellen Applikationen, die in der Entwicklung des digitalen Fortschritts und digitaler Strukturen im Rahmen der CI Versorgung eine besondere Rolle spielen und f\u00fcr das Verst\u00e4ndnis der weiteren Entwicklung wichtig sind.M\u00f6glichkeiten einer vereinfachten Anpassung ergeben sich z.\u2009B. durch eine automatische MAP-Erstellung (Artificial Intelligence Anwendungen), Remote Care Netzwerke (Telemedizin, Apps) f\u00f6rdern die aktive Selbstbeteiligung der Patienten und erlauben v\u00f6llig neue Formen einer ortsungebundenen Patientenversorgung (automatisierte technische Implantatkontrolle, Selbstprogrammierung, Upgrades).

In recent years, artificial neural network has been used in the fields of neuroscience, computer science, cognitive science, mathematics and physics. With the Chinese automobile industry as the research object, the global value chain as the research tool, and the promotion of Chinese automobile industry cluster as the research objective, This paper deals with information processing by simulating neural activity in the brain according to the cognitive artificial neural network to study the upgrading of Chinese automobile industry cluster, and puts forward the related suggestion on the upgrading of Chinese automobile industry cluster. This study believes that in order to promote the upgrading of Chinese automobile industry cluster, it's essential to promote the independent innovation of enterprises in the cluster and indispensable to strengthen government support, which has certain guiding significance to the development of Chinese automobile industry cluster.", "Understanding the risk factors that initiate cancer is essential for reducing the future cancer burden. Much of our current cancer control insight is from cohort studies and newer large-scale population laboratories designed to advance the science around precision oncology. Despite their promise for improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes, their current reductionist focus will likely have little impact shifting the cancer burden. However, it is possible that these big data assets can be adapted to have more impact on the future cancer burden through more focus on primary prevention efforts that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). ML automatically learns patterns and can devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction in big data, revealing new unexpected relationships and pathways in a reliable and replicable fashion that otherwise would remain hidden given the complexities of big data. While AI has made big strides in several domains, the potential application in cancer prevention is lacking. As such, this commentary suggests that it may be time to consider the potential of AI within our existing cancer control population laboratories, and provides justification for why some small targeted investments to explore their impact on modelling existing real-time cancer prevention data may be a strategic cancer control opportunity.", "In the terrestrial ecosystems, perennial challenges of increased frequency and intensity of wildfires are exacerbated by climate change and unplanned human activities. Development of robust management and suppression plans requires accurate estimates of future burn probabilities. This study describes the development and validation of two hybrid intelligence predictive models that rely on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and two metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., genetic algorithm (GA) and firefly algorithm (FA), for the spatially explicit prediction of wildfire probabilities. A suite of ten explanatory variables (altitude, slope, aspect, land use, rainfall, soil order, temperature, wind effect, and distance to roads and human settlements) was investigated and a spatial database constructed using 32 fire events from the Zagros ecoregion (Iran). The frequency ratio model was used to assign weights to each class of variables that depended on the strength of the spatial association between each class and the probability of wildfire occurrence. The weights were then used for training the ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-FA hybrid models. The models were validated using the ROC-AUC method that indicated that the ANFIS-GA model performed better (AUCsuccessrate\u202f=\u202f0.92; AUCpredictionrate\u202f=\u202f0.91) than the ANFIS-FA model (AUCsuccessrate\u202f=\u202f0.89; AUCpredictionrate\u202f=\u202f0.88). The efficiency of these models was compared to a single ANFIS model and statistical analyses of paired comparisons revealed that the two meta-optimized predictive models significantly improved wildfire prediction accuracy compared to the single ANFIS model (AUCsuccessrate\u202f=\u202f0.82; AUCpredictionrate\u202f=\u202f0.78). We concluded that such predictive models may become valuable toolkits to effectively guide fire management plans and on-the-ground decisions on firefighting strategies.", "To assess brain oscillations in very preterm and full-term born adolescents and explore subgroups based on integrative patterns of brain oscillations with different frequencies. Additionally, subgroups were related to functional outcomes and very preterm birth.\nA Dutch cohort of 53 very preterm and 61 full-term born adolescents aged 13\u202fyears participated. Resting-state electroencephalography was recorded. Absolute and relative delta, theta, alpha, and beta power were compared between groups. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups with distinct activity patterns and to relate these patterns to intelligence, academic performance, motor skills, and very preterm birth.\nVery preterm adolescents exhibited decreased relative beta activity. LCA with four classes showed the best model fit. The class with the highest level of delta and lowest levels of theta, alpha, and beta power was associated with lowest intelligence, academic, and motor estimates. Very preterm born adolescents were more likely than controls to be members of this class.\nVery preterm born adolescents showed altered oscillatory activity, indicating long-lasting effects of very preterm birth on brain functioning. Distinct activity patterns were associated with both functional outcomes and very preterm birth.\nSpecific patterns of brain oscillations may serve as biomarkers for poor functional outcome after very preterm birth.", "Grit is a positive noncognitive trait that is based on an individual's passion for long-term goals, coupled with a powerful motivation to achieve. Grit has been shown to be a greater predictor of success than intelligence. As the curriculum for orthopaedic trainees continues to evolve, deliberate practice for surgical skills, encouraging a growth mindset, and enhancing grit may be as important as preparation for board examinations. Although talent and skill play a role in achievement, the effort put forth in developing a skill can dramatically affect the ultimate achievement. Therefore, grit is a trait that can be developed. As educators, we can encourage hard work, reflection, and appropriate risk-taking. Implicit biases and microaggressions occur on a daily basis within orthopaedics, and grit will be an important trait to possess in order to combat these biases. However, we also will have to work as a community to create a more welcoming culture to underrepresented groups so that we can provide the highest level of musculoskeletal care and improve patient outcomes.", "Research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI) has increasing clinical relevance for therapeutic applications in mental health services. With innovations ranging from 'virtual psychotherapists' to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed.\nThis paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI.\nBased on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions.\nFrom an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; 'gaps' in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition.\nWe argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.", "The burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to profoundly impact the public's health. Yet, to make the most of this opportunity, decision-makers must understand AI concepts. In this article, we describe approaches and fields within AI and illustrate through examples how they can contribute to informed decisions, with a focus on population health applications. We first introduce core concepts needed to understand modern uses of AI and then describe its sub-fields. Finally, we examine four sub-fields of AI most relevant to population health along with examples of available tools and frameworks. Artificial intelligence is a broad and complex field, but the tools that enable the use of AI techniques are becoming more accessible, less expensive, and easier to use than ever before. Applications of AI have the potential to assist clinicians, health system managers, policy-makers, and public health practitioners in making more precise, and potentially more effective, decisions.", "In medical image analysis for disease diagnosis, segmentation is one of the challenging tasks. Owing to the inherited degradations in MRI improper segments are produced. Segmentation process is an important step in brain tissue analysis. Moreover, an early detection of plaque in carotid artery using ultrasound images may prevent serious brain strokes. Unfortunately, low quality and noisy ultrasound images are still challenges for accurate segmentation. The objective of this research is to develop a robust segmentation approach for medical images such as brain MRI and carotid artery ultrasound images.\nIn this paper, a novel approach is proposed to address the segmentation challenges of medical images. The proposed approach employed fuzzy intelligence and Gaussian mixture model (GMM). It comprises two phases; firstly, incorporating spatial fuzzy c-means in GMM by exploiting statistical, texture, and wavelet image features. During model development, GMM parameters are estimated in presence of noise by EM algorithm iteratively. Utilizing these parameters, brain MRI images are segmented. In next phase, developed approach is applied to solve a real problem of carotid artery plaque detection using ultrasound images. The dataset of real patients annotated by radiologists has been obtained from Radiology Department, Shifa International Hospital Islamabad, Pakistan. For this, intima-media-thickness values are computed from the proposed segmentation followed by support vector machines for plaque classification (normal/abnormal).\nThe obtained segmentation has been evaluated on standard brain MRI dataset and offers high segmentation accuracy of 99.2%. The proposed approach outperforms in term of segmentation performance range of 3-9% as compared to the state of the art approaches on brain MRI. Furthermore, the proposed approach shows robustness to various levels of Gaussian and Rician image noises. On carotid artery dataset, we have obtained high plaque detection rate in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-score values of 98.8%, 99.3%, 98.0%, and 97.5% respectively.\nThe proposed approach segments both modalities with high precision and shows robustness at Gaussian and Rician noise levels. Results for brain MRI and ultrasound images indicate its effectiveness and can be used as second opinion in addition to the radiologists. The developed approach is straightforward, efficient, and reproducible. It may benefit to improve the clinical evaluation of the disease in both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals.", "Coal-fired power plants (CFPP) represent a health risk to the exposed communities. A review of national and international scientific literature was made focused on the health effects on children and exposure to air emissions from CFPP. Twenty-one articles were included for full-text review, where effects on child health mainly related to the biomarkers presence of exposure and effect, pe rinatal, neurobehavioral and respiratory damages were measured. Exposure to CFPP emissions in pregnancy was associated with low birth weight and very low birth weight, shorter height, smaller head circumference (HC) diameter, and prematurity; the HC diameter increased in newborns after the CFPP closure. Lower coefficient of development (CD) and intelligence quotient (IQ) were found in children exposed to CFPP emissions compared with unexposed ones; CD increased when the plant was closed. On the other hand, living in areas with mercury emission sources (associated with CFPP and cement plants that work with coal) was associated with an increased risk of autism. In respira tory health, the articles were consistent with reporting lower pulmonary function in children living in areas exposed to coal combustion sources compared with groups of unexposed children. There is a great need to open the debate in Chile on the controllable risks faced by the child population as a result of power generation plants located in Chile.", "We conducted a 24-week, randomized, double-blind parallel-controlled trial to test whether buspirone is beneficial to improve cognitive deficits of schizophrenia because it remains unclear. Two hundred patients received in random order either co-treatment buspirone with AAPDs or monotherapy with AAPDs. All patients had been treated with a stable dosage of AAPDs for at least three months. The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24), and 14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA-14) were used to evaluate clinical symptoms. The short version of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised in China (WAIS-RC) was used to assess neurocognitive function. Social function and family burden were evaluated by Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS) and Family Burden Interview Schedule (FBIS). All patients were enrolled at baseline and followed up after 12 and 24\u202fweeks. A total of 196 patients completed the trial, with 99 in the combined treatment group and 97 in the control group. During the intervention, the score of PANSS, HAMD-24, and HAMA-14 decreased slightly without group differences. Repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences between the two groups in the score of arithmetic, similarities, picture completion, block design, SDSS, and FBIS (P\u202f<\u202f0.05), but no difference was found with regard to the score of information, digital span test, or digital symbols (P\u202f>\u202f0.05). In conclusion, co-treatment with buspirone and APPDs outperformed APPDs alone in improving cognitive deficit and reducing family burden of schizophrenia. Buspirone may be a promising candidate for co-treatment of schizophrenia-associated cognitive deficits.", "Under compression, \"'simple'\" alkali metals and their alloys exhibit complex structural and electronic properties, leading to fundamental interest in their high-pressure behaviors. Here, the swarm-intelligence structure-searching method was employed to identify the high-pressure phases of binary interalkali Na2K, which has long been known to possess a MgZn2-Laves phase at ambient pressure, but the high-pressure behavior remains elusive. We uncovered four new structures over a pressure range of 10-500 GPa, although the compound was found to become unstable upon decomposition into Na and K from 37 to 273 GPa. In phases before decomposition, the electrons were gradually delocalized with an increase in pressure and there was charge transfer from K to Na, whereas in phases after recombination, the electrons were gradually localized into the interstitials of the crystals, showing the unexpected opposite trend of charge transfer from Na to K, remarkably, where K was found to exhibit an oxidation state beyond the -1 valence state. The results can improve our understanding of the interaction and evolution of s electrons under compression.", "Background: Using artificial intelligence to assist in diagnosing diseases has become a contemporary research hotspot. Conventional automatic diagnostic method uses a conventional machine learning algorithm to distinguish features from which a professional doctor manually extracts features in diagnostic reports. But it can be difficult to collect large amounts of necessary medical data. Therefore, these methods face challenges with efficiency and accuracy. Method: Here, we proposed an automatic diagnostic system based on a deep learning algorithm to diagnose hyperlipidemia by using human physiological parameters. This model is a neural network which uses technologies of data extension and data correction. Firstly, we corrected and supplemented the original data by the method mentioned previously to solve the problem of lacking data. Secondly, the processed data were used to train a deep learning model. Deep learning model can automatically extract all the available information instead of artificially reducing the raw data. Therefore, it can reduce labor costs. The classifiers classify the data by using features previously mentioned. Finally, the system was evaluated with data from a test dataset. Result: It achieved 91.49% accuracy, 87.50% sensitivity, 93.33% specificity, and 87.50% precision with data from the test dataset. Conclusion: The proposed diagnostic method has a highly robust and accurate performance, and can be used for tentative diagnosis. It can automatically diagnose diseases by using human physiological parameters, thereby reducing labor cost, which results in effective improvement of clinical diagnostic efficiency.", "Background: In the field of healthcare, higher skills in emotional intelligence (EI) have been proven to have a positive impact on healthcare professionals in general and occupational therapists in particular and also on teamwork and patient care. The purpose of this research was to determine whether performing practical work included in the undergraduate Occupational Therapy program improves students' self-perceived EI, and whether there are any differences in the latter depending on the area in which this practical training is performed. Methods: It was conducted a multicenter, quasi-experimental, pre-post study with Occupational Therapy undergraduate students in the 2016-2017 academic year. A total of 184 students met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 10 (5.40%) declined to participate; therefore, the participation rate was 94.60% and the initial sample comprised 174 students. Mean age was 21.34 years (SD = 2.54) and 84.50% (n = 147) were women. Students' self-perceived EI was measured with the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24). This measure was completed in the two weeks prior to the start of the practical training period and one week after the end of it. McNemar-Bowker and McNemar tests were used to analyze the differences in self-perceived EI between these two points in time. Results: After the practical training, an improvement in self-perceived EI was observed in women (Emotional Attention, Emotional Clarity, and Emotional Regulation dimensions). Regarding areas of practical training, results showed an improvement in EI in women who had received practical training in the areas of Physical Rehabilitation, Mental Health and Geriatrics and Gerontology. Conclusions: The findings contribute to a better understanding of the relation between practical training and an improvement in self-perceived EI. This insight can help make changes in the teaching methodology to enhance the emotional skills needed for a better professional performance.", "Objectives: To examine differences in cognition parameters by birth weight categories and to analyze whether the relationships between birth weight and cognitive functions are mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in schoolchildren. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a sample of 664 school children from the MOVI-Kids study. Variables: i) cognitive function measured by the Battery of General and Differential Aptitudes (BADyG); ii) birth weight, reported by parents; and iii) CRF (20-m shuttle run test). ANCOVA models were estimated to assess differences in cognitive function categories across birth weight and CRF categories. Mediation analysis was conducted with Hayes' PROCESS macro. Results: CRF is a full mediator of the association between birth weight with the verbal and numerical factors, and general intelligence; and is a partial mediator when logical reasoning and the spatial factor were the dependent variables. The available data suggest that, in schoolchildren, the influence of birth weight on cognitive function is mediated by CRF. Conclusions: These findings highlight that children with lower birth weight values and lower fitness levels should be target subgroups to improve children's cognition, in which long-life physical activity interventions at early ages are a priority.", "This study investigated the neurocognitive predictors of length of stay (LOS) within a children's psychiatric inpatient program. A medical chart review was conducted for 96 children aged 6-14 years who received a neuropsychological evaluation during hospitalization. Correlation and linear regression analyses examined the influence of neurocognition (memory, construction, executive functioning [EF], and intelligence [IQ]) on subsequent LOS. Impairment/performance was calculated by the standard mean composite score and global deficit score (GDS) approaches for each domain and for overall neurocognition. Rates of impairment were similar between the two approaches (ranging from 22.9% to 45.8% across domains). Overall neurocognition (r = .347 & -.270, respectively), EF (r = .333 & -.261, respectively), and construction (r = .287 & -.240), respectively, were significantly associated with LOS utilizing the GDS and composite approaches. After controlling for clinical/demographic predictors of LOS, GDS-Total, GDS-EF/Construction, and EF/Construction composite scores significantly predicted LOS. Further, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve detected the GDS was able to distinguish between those children that would and would not end up having a prolonged hospitalization. The GDS and composite score approaches to neurocognitive impairment detection were similarly able to capture neurocognitive impairment and the association of impairment to LOS within a children's psychiatric inpatient program.", "Background Risk stratification systems for thyroid nodules are often complicated and affected by low specificity. Continual improvement of these systems is necessary to reduce the number of unnecessary thyroid biopsies. Purpose To use artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS). Materials and Methods A total of 1425 biopsy-proven thyroid nodules from 1264 consecutive patients (1026 women; mean age, 52.9 years [range, 18-93 years]) were evaluated retrospectively. Expert readers assigned points based on five ACR TI-RADS categories (composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, echogenic foci), and a genetic AI algorithm was applied to a training set (1325 nodules). Point and pathologic data were used to create an optimized scoring system (hereafter, AI TI-RADS). Performance of the systems was compared by using a test set of the final 100 nodules with interpretations from the expert reader, eight nonexpert readers, and an expert panel. Initial performance of AI TI-RADS was calculated by using a test for differences between binomial proportions. Additional comparisons across readers were conducted by using bootstrapping; diagnostic performance was assessed by using area under the receiver operating curve. Results AI TI-RADS assigned new point values for eight ACR TI-RADS features. Six features were assigned zero points, which simplified categorization. By using expert reader data, the diagnostic performance of ACR TI-RADS and AI TI-RADS was area under the receiver operating curve of 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. For the same expert, specificity of AI TI-RADS (65%, 55 of 85) was higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (47%, 40 of 85). For the eight nonexpert radiologists, mean specificity for AI TI-RADS (55%) was also higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (48%). An interactive AI TI-RADS calculator can be viewed at http://deckard.duhs.duke.edu/\u223cai-ti-rads . Conclusion An artificial intelligence-optimized Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) validates the American College of Radiology TI-RADS while slightly improving specificity and maintaining sensitivity. Additionally, it simplifies feature assignments, which may improve ease of use. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "The development of a sense of agency is indispensable for a cognitive entity (biological or artificial) to become a cognitive agent. In developmental psychology, researchers have taken inspiration from adult cognitive psychology and neuroscience literature and use the comparator model to assess the presence of a sense of agency in early infancy. Similarly, robotics researchers have taken components of the proposed mechanism in attempts to build a sense of agency into artificial systems. In this article, we identify an invalidating theoretical flaw in the reasoning underlying this conversion from adult studies to developmental science and cognitive systems research, rooted in an oversight in the conceptualization of the comparator model as currently used in experimental practice. In these experiments, the emphasis has been put solely on testing for a match between predicted and observed sensory consequences. We argue that the match by itself can exclusively generate a simple categorization or a representation of equality between predicted and observed sensory consequences, both of which are insufficient to generate the causal representations required for a sense of agency. Consequently, the comparator model, as it has been described in the context of the sense of agency and as it is commonly used in experimental designs, is insufficient to generate the sense of agency: infants and robots require more than developing the ability to match predicted and observed sensory consequences for a sense of agency. We conclude with outlining possible solutions and future directions for researchers in developmental science and artificial intelligence.", "Lung cancer is the cancer with the highest morbidity and mortality at home and abroad at present. Using computed tomography (CT) to screen lung cancer nodules is a huge workload. To test the effect of artificial intelligence in automatic identification of lung cancer by using artificial intelligence to find the lung cancer nodules automatically in the chest CT of 1 mm and 5 mm thick.\n5,000 cases of T1 stage lung cancer patients with 1 mm and 5 mm layer thickness were respectively labeled and learned by computer neural network, the algorithm of forming pulmonary nodules was carried out. 500 cases of chest CT in T1 stage lung cancer patients with 1 mm and 5 mm thickness were tested by artificial intelligence formation, and the sensitivity and specificity were compared with artificial reading.\nUsing artificial intelligence to read chest CT 500 in 5 mm, the sensitivity was 95.20%, the specificity was 93.20%, and the Kappa value of two times repeated read was 0.926,1. For 1 mm chest CT 500 cases, the sensitivity is 96.40%, the specificity is 95.60%, and the Kappa reads two times is 0.938,6. Compared with 5 doctors, the same CT sets with 1 mm thickness were read. The detection rates of artificial intelligence and artificial reading were similar to those of lung cancer nodules and negative control read films, and there was no significant difference between them. In the comparison of the same CT slices with 5 mm thickness, the number of detection of lung cancer nodules by artificial intelligence is better than that of artificial reading, and the sensitivity is higher, but the number of false messages is increased and the specificity is slightly worse.\nThe automatic learning of early lung cancer chest CT images by artificial intelligence can achieve high sensitivity and specificity of early lung cancer identification, and assist doctors in the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u9898\u76ee\uff1a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\u5728T1\u671f\u80ba\u764c\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u76ee\u7684 \u80ba\u764c\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u56fd\u5185\u5916\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u53ca\u81f4\u6b7b\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u764c\u75c7\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\uff08computed tomography, CT\uff09\u7b5b\u67e5\u80ba\u764c\u7ed3\u8282\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u57281 mm\u53ca5 mm\u5c42\u539a\u7684\u80f8\u90e8CT\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u5bfb\u627e\u80ba\u764c\u7ed3\u8282\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5 \u5206\u522b\u6807\u6ce85 mm\u53ca1 mm\u5c42\u539a\u7684T1\u671f\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u80f8\u90e8CT\u7247\u54045,000\u4f8b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u80ba\u90e8\u7ed3\u8282\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6d4b\u8bd51 mm\u53ca5 mm\u5c42\u539a\u7684T1\u671f\u80ba\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u80f8\u90e8CT\u7247\u5404500\u4f8b\uff0c\u540c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bfb\u7247\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u654f\u611f\u6027\u53ca\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c \u5229\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8bfb\u53d65 mm\u7684\u80f8\u90e8CT 500\u4f8b\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u8fbe95.20%\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8fbe93.20%\uff0c\u4e24\u6b21\u91cd\u590d\u8bfb\u53d6\u7684Kappa\u503c\u8fbe0.926,1\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e1 mm\u7684\u80f8\u90e8CT 500\u4f8b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e3a96.40%\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e3a95.60%\uff0c\u4e24\u6b21\u91cd\u590d\u8bfb\u53d6\u7684Kappa\u503c\u4e3a0.938,6\u3002\u800c\u4e0e5\u4f4d\u533b\u5e08\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5bf91 mm\u5c42\u539a\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6CT\u7247\u8fdb\u884c\u8bfb\u7247\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bfb\u7247\u5bf9\u4e8e\u80ba\u764c\u7ed3\u8282\u548c\u9634\u6027\u5bf9\u7167\u8bfb\u7247\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u6bd4\u8f83\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u800c\u57285 mm\u5c42\u539a\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6CT\u7247\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5bf9\u80ba\u764c\u7ed3\u8282\u7684\u68c0\u51fa\u6570\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bfb\u7247\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u8bef\u62a5\u6570\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7a0d\u5dee\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba \u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65e9\u671f\u80ba\u764c\u80f8\u90e8CT\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u80ba\u764c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u53ca\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u8f85\u52a9\u533b\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u2029\u3011 \u3010\u4e2d\u6587\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff1b\u80ba\u80bf\u7624\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f53\u5c42\u6444\u5f71\u3011.", "Few personalised medicine investigations have been conducted for mental health. We aimed to generate and validate a risk tool that predicts adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nUsing logistic regression models, we generated a risk tool in a representative population cohort (ALSPAC - UK, 5113 participants, followed from birth to age 17) using childhood clinical and sociodemographic data with internal validation. Predictors included sex, socioeconomic status, single-parent family, ADHD symptoms, comorbid disruptive disorders, childhood maltreatment, ADHD symptoms, depressive symptoms, mother's depression and intelligence quotient. The outcome was defined as a categorical diagnosis of ADHD in young adulthood without requiring age at onset criteria. We also tested Machine Learning approaches for developing the risk models: Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting and Artificial Neural Network. The risk tool was externally validated in the E-Risk cohort (UK, 2040 participants, birth to age 18), the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort (Brazil, 3911 participants, birth to age 18) and the MTA clinical sample (USA, 476 children with ADHD and 241 controls followed for 16 years from a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 26 years old).\nThe overall prevalence of adult ADHD ranged from 8.1 to 12% in the population-based samples, and was 28.6% in the clinical sample. The internal performance of the model in the generating sample was good, with an area under the curve (AUC) for predicting adult ADHD of 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.83). Calibration plots showed good agreement between predicted and observed event frequencies from 0 to 60% probability. In the UK birth cohort test sample, the AUC was 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.78). In the Brazilian birth cohort test sample, the AUC was significantly lower -0.57 (95% CI 0.54-0.60). In the clinical trial test sample, the AUC was 0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.80). The risk model did not predict adult anxiety or major depressive disorder. Machine Learning approaches did not outperform logistic regression models. An open-source and free risk calculator was generated for clinical use and is available online at https://ufrgs.br/prodah/adhd-calculator/.\nThe risk tool based on childhood characteristics specifically predicts adult ADHD in European and North-American population-based and clinical samples with comparable discrimination to commonly used clinical tools in internal medicine and higher than most previous attempts for mental and neurological disorders. However, its use in middle-income settings requires caution.", "Cognitive involvement in beta-thalassaemia is strikingly controversial and poorly studied in adulthood. This multicentre prospective study investigated 74 adult neurologically-asymptomatic beta-thalassaemia patients (mean-age 34\u00b75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00b73\u00a0years; 53 transfusion-dependent [TDT], 21 non-transfusion dependent [NTDT]) and 45 healthy volunteers (mean-age 33\u00b79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00b77\u00a0years). Participants underwent testing with Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and multiparametric brain 3T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for parenchymal, vascular and iron content evaluation. Patients had lower Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) than controls (75\u00b75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00b79 vs. 97\u00b74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00b71, P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b70001) even after correction for education level. Compared to TDT, NTDT showed a trend of higher FSIQ (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b708) but a similar cognitive profile at WAIS-subtests. FSIQ correlated with total and indirect bilirubin (P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b70001 and P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7002, respectively); no correlation was found with splenectomy, intracranial MRI/magnetic resonance-angiography findings, brain tissue iron content or other disease-related clinical/laboratory/treatment data. FSIQ did not correlate with BPRS scores, although the latter were higher among patients (28\u00b774\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00b71 vs. 27\u00b729\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00b78, P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b701) mainly because of increased depression and anxiety levels. Occupation rate was higher among controls (84\u00b74% vs. 64\u00b79%, P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7004) and correlated with higher FSIQ (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7001) and education level (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7001). In conclusion, Italian adult beta-thalassaemia patients seem to present a characteristic cognitive profile impairment and an increased rate of psychological disorders with possible profound long-term socio-economic consequences.", "The use of different imaging modalities to assist in skin cancer diagnosis is a common practice in clinical scenarios. Different features representative of the lesion under evaluation can be retrieved from image analysis and processing. However, the integration and understanding of these additional parameters can be a challenging task for physicians, so artificial intelligence (AI) methods can be implemented to assist in this process. This bibliographic research was performed with the goal of assessing the current applications of AI algorithms as an assistive tool in skin cancer diagnosis, based on information retrieved from different imaging modalities.\nThe bibliography databases ISI Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus were used for the literature search, with the combination of keywords: skin cancer, skin neoplasm, imaging and classification methods.\nThe search resulted in 526 publications, which underwent a screening process, considering the established eligibility criteria. After screening, only 65 were qualified for revision.\nDifferent imaging modalities have already been coupled with AI methods, particularly dermoscopy for melanoma recognition. Learners based on support vector machines seem to be the preferred option. Future work should focus on image analysis, processing stages and image fusion assuring the best possible classification outcome.", "Living beings use mechanical interaction with the environment to gather essential cues for implementing necessary movements and actions. This process is mediated by biomechanics, primarily of the sensory structures, meaning that, at first, mechanical stimuli are morphologically computed. In the present paper, we select and review cases of specialized sensory organs for mechanical sensing-from both the animal and plant kingdoms-that distribute their intelligence in both structure and materials. A focus is set on biomechanical aspects, such as morphology and material characteristics of the selected sensory organs, and on how their sensing function is affected by them in natural environments. In this route, examples of artificial sensors that implement these principles are provided, and/or ways in which they can be translated artificially are suggested. Following a biomimetic approach, our aim is to make a step towards creating a toolbox with general tailoring principles, based on mechanical aspects tuned repeatedly in nature, such as orientation, shape, distribution, materials, and micromechanics. These should be used for a future methodical design of novel soft sensing systems for soft robotics.", "Evidence suggests that cumulative early psychosocial adversity can influence early child development (ECD). The Childhood Psychosocial Adversity Scale (CPAS) is a novel measure of cumulative risk designed for use in global ECD research. We describe its development and assess validity from its first application in Bangladesh, where it predicts cognitive development scores among young children.\nItems were generated from literature review and qualitatively assessed for local relevance. Two-hundred and eighty-five mother-child dyads from an urban slum of Dhaka completed the CPAS at child ages 18, 24, 48, and/or 60 months. The CPAS was assessed for internal consistency, retest reliability, and convergent, incremental, and predictive validity.\nThe CPAS includes subscales assessing child maltreatment, caregiver mental health, family conflict, domestic violence, and household/community psychosocial risks. In Bangladesh, subscales had good internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1\u2009>\u20090.70). Full-scale score had good 2-week test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient\u2009=\u20090.89; F(38,38)\u2009=\u20098.45, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Using multivariate regression, 48-month CPAS score significantly predicted 60-month intelligence quotient, accounting for more variance than socioeconomic status or malnutrition.\nThe CPAS is a novel tool assessing cumulative childhood psychosocial risk. Evidence supports validity of its use in ECD research in Bangladesh, and ongoing work is applying it in additional countries.", "The present study aimed to analyze the association between of the dimensions of emotional intelligence (attention, clarity, and repair) and different levels of perceived happiness (low, medium, and high) in adolescents. The sample consists of 646 students in the first, second, third, and fourth years of Secondary Education, 47.5% females and 52.5% males, between 12 and 17 years of age. The instruments used were the Spanish version of the Trait Meta Mood Scale-24 Questionnaire to measure perceived emotional intelligence and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. Multinomial logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed. The results suggest that as the capacity of understanding and regulation of emotional intelligence increases, happiness also increases. Adolescence is seen as an ideal time in life to encourage the development of emotional capacities that contribute to the greater happiness of individuals. In this way, the present study stresses the need to carry out practices leading to improvements in the adolescents' emotional intelligence and therefore increase their happiness and emotional well-being.", "Dear Colleagues,it is an extraordinary pleasure for me to present this really interesting booklet that was created at the occasion of the 90th Annual Meeting of the German Society of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, Head & Neck Surgery. The highly significant scientific contributions from nine universities discuss different aspects of the meeting's motto entitled \"Digitization in Oto-Rhino-Laryngology\" and show important fields for developing and securing the future of our discipline.During the last years, digitization and artificial intelligence gain increasingly in importance for the German healthcare landscape and thus also for the field of oto-rhino-laryngology. With regard to future developments in healthcare services it is essential to impart digital competences to physicians, medical staff, but also to patients in a well-structured way. At the same time, the legal and ethical issues resulting from medical-technological progresses have to be thoroughly discussed.\nLiebe Kolleginnen, liebe Kollegen,es freut mich au\u00dferordentlich, den aus meiner Sicht sehr spannenden Referateband zur 90.

However, the neural changes in the neonate that might mediate the adverse effects of maternal noninfectious fever are not fully characterized. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that induced maternal noninfectious fever alters neonatal neural progenitor cell proliferation and enhances microglial activation in the rat dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.\nSystemic vehicle or IL-6 was given 3 times to near-term pregnant rats (n = 7/group) every 90 minutes, and maternal core temperature was recorded. Neonatal brains were processed and analyzed for dentate gyrus cell proliferation (using Ki-67, n = 10/group, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, n = 6/group) and resident microglia activation (using ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein-1 [Iba-1], n = 6/group). In separate studies, the authors assessed microglia proliferation using Ki-67/Iba-1 costaining (n = 5/group).\nCompared to controls, exposure to IL-6 resulted in significant maternal temperature increase [mean temperature difference 0.558\u00b0C (95% CI, 0.417-0.698; P < .0001)]. Following maternal IL-6, Ki-67 cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus was 55 % higher in neonates whose mother received IL-6 (38.8 \u00b1 9.2) compared with those that received vehicle (25.1 \u00b1 7.8); mean difference 13.7 (95% CI, 5.68-21.71); (P = .0021). Glial fibrillary acidic protein cell proliferation was 40% higher in the neonatal dentate gyrus whose mother received IL-6 when compared to controls (713 \u00b1 85.52 vs 500 \u00b1 115); mean difference 212 (95% CI, 82.2-343.4); (P = .004). Resident microglial activation was 90% higher in the dentate gyrus of neonates whose mother received IL-6 when compared to controls (71.8 \u00b1 9.3 vs 37.8 \u00b1 5.95); mean Iba-1 in stained cells was significantly different between IL-6 and vehicle groups 34 (95% CI, 23.94-44.05); (P < .0001). Proliferating microglia, determined by the colocalization of Ki-67 and Iba-1, were not different in the vehicle (8.8 % \u00b1 3.19 %) and the IL-6 (5.6% \u00b1 2.3%) groups (mean difference 3.2% (95% CI, -0.8-7.25) (P = .1063).\nIL-6 is sufficient to induce maternal systemic temperature increases in near-term pregnant rats as well as neuronal, glial, and neuroinflammatory changes in the dentate gyrus of the neonatal hippocampus. These alterations might disrupt fetal neurodevelopment during a vulnerable period.", "Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) are unique ways to incorporate the benefits of technology and psychology to address differing health needs through various media, including Internet interventions, mobile apps, and video games. BITs present several possible benefits, including increased dissemination and accessibility, cost-effectiveness, increased engagement, and decreased stigma, especially among youth. A behavioral coaching chatbot, Tess, addresses different facets of behavioral health, such as depression and anxiety. Available 24/7, Tess delivers customized integrative support, psychoeducation, and interventions through brief conversations via existing communication channels (i.e., SMS text messaging and Facebook Messenger). This study assessed the feasibility of integrating Tess in behavioral counseling of adolescent patients (n = 23; Mage = 15.20 years; Rangeage = 9.78-18.54 years; 57% female) coping with weight management and prediabetes symptoms. Tess engaged patients via a preferred method of communication (SMS text messaging) in individualized conversations to promote treatment adherence, behavior change, and overall wellness. Adolescent patients reported experiencing positive progress toward their goals 81% of the time. The 4,123 messages exchanged and patients' reported usefulness ratings (96% of the time) illustrate that adolescents engaged with and viewed this chatbot as helpful. These results highlight the feasibility and benefit of support through artificial intelligence, specifically in a pediatric setting, which could be scaled to serve larger groups of patients. As a partner to clinicians, Tess can continue the therapeutic interaction outside office hours while maintaining patient satisfaction. Due to Tess's capacity for continuous learning, future iterations may have additional features to increase the user experience.", "Here, a streamlined, scalable, laboratory approach is discussed that enables medium-to-large dataset analysis. The presented approach combines data management, artificial intelligence, containerization, cluster orchestration, and quality control in a unified analytic pipeline. The unique combination of these individual building blocks creates a new and powerful analysis approach that can readily be applied to medium-to-large datasets by researchers to accelerate the pace of research. The proposed framework is applied to a project that counts the number of plasmonic nanoparticles bound to peripheral blood mononuclear cells in dark-field microscopy images. By using the techniques presented in this article, the images are automatically processed overnight, without user interaction, streamlining the path from experiment to conclusions.", "Brain signaling occurs across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, and analysis of brain signal variability and synchrony has attracted recent attention as markers of intelligence, cognitive states, and brain disorders. However, current technologies to measure brain signals in humans have limited resolutions either in space or in time and cannot fully capture spatiotemporal variability, leaving it untested whether temporal variability and spatiotemporal synchrony are valid and reliable proxy of spatiotemporal variability in vivo. Here we used optical voltage imaging in mice under anesthesia and wakefulness to monitor cortical voltage activity at both high spatial and temporal resolutions to investigate functional connectivity (FC, a measure of spatiotemporal synchronization), Multi-Scale Entropy (MSE, a measure of temporal variability), and their relationships to Regional Entropy (RE, a measure of spatiotemporal variability). We observed that across cortical space, MSE pattern can largely explain RE pattern at small and large temporal scales with high positive and negative correlation respectively, while FC pattern strongly negatively associated with RE pattern. The time course of FC and small scale MSE tightly followed that of RE, while large scale MSE was more loosely coupled to RE. fMRI and EEG data simulated by reducing spatiotemporal resolution of the voltage imaging data or considering hemodynamics yielded MSE and FC measures that still contained information about RE based on the high resolution voltage imaging data. This suggested that MSE and FC could still be effective measures to capture spatiotemporal variability under limitation of imaging modalities applicable to human subjects. Our results support the notion that FC and MSE are effective biomarkers for brain states, and provide a promising viewpoint to unify these two principal domains in human brain data analysis.", "Developing actuators with multi-responsibility, large deformation, and predefined shapes is critical for the application of actuators in the field of artificial intelligence. Herein, we report the preparation of a new type of unimorph actuators containing phenol-formaldelyde resin (PFR) and graphene oxide (GO) using the chiral nematic structure of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as the template. The so-obtained PFR/GO films have a unimorph structure with an asymmetric distribution of GO across the film. They exhibit synchronous responses of both photonic properties and actuation to humidifying/dehumidifying. Moreover, PFR/GO films can be forged into desired shapes by aldehyde treatment, and thereby are able to produce complex movements. In addition, the objects with predetermined shapes show good shape recovery capability upon many wetting-drying cycles, especially through the treatment with formaldehyde. A mechanism model for shape predetermination by aldehyde treatment is suggested based on experimental details. By further designing the predetermined shapes and patterns, such PFR/GO actuators may hold great promise for smart actuation devices of highly complex movements.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has existed for decades and continues to evolve as technology advances. In health care, AI can be used to simplify the check-in process for patients, make patient records more efficient, monitor disease, aid diagnosis, assist in surgical procedures, and offer mental health therapy. In radiology, AI assists in multiple processes including scheduling patients, billing, optimizing staffing, creating protocols, assessing image quality, reducing radiation dose, and image interpretation.
