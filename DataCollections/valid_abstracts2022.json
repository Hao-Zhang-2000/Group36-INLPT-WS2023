{"abstracts": ["In this work, we focus on the dispersion of COVID-19-laden droplets using the transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling and simulation of the coughing process of virus carriers in an enclosure room, aiming to set up the basic prototype of popular precautionary strategies, i.e., face mask, upward ventilation, protective screen, or any combination thereof, against the indoor transmission of COVID-19 and other highly contagious diseases in the future. A multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian CFD particle-tracking model with user-defined functions is utilized under 8 cases to examine the characteristics of droplet dispersion concerning the mass and heat transfer, droplet evaporation, air buoyancy, air convection, air-droplet friction, and turbulent dispersion. The result shows that implementing upward ventilation is the most effective measure, followed by wearing face masks. Protective screens can restrict the movement of the coughing droplets (though it will not reduce viral load). However, applying protective screens arranged with lean can be counterproductive in preventing the spread of COVID-19 when it is inappropriately placed with ventilation. The soundest solution is the combination of the face mask and upward ventilation, which can reduce the indoor infectious concentration by nearly 99.95% compared with the baseline without any precautionary strategies. With the resumption of school and work in the post-epidemic era, this study would provide intelligence-enhancing advice for the masses and rule-makers to curb the pandemic.", "The simulation optimization method was used to the identification of light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) groundwater contamination source (GCS) with the help of a hypothetical case in this study. When applying the simulation optimization method to identify GCS, it was a common technical means to establish surrogate model for the simulation model to participate in the iterative calculation to reduce the calculation load and calculation time. However, it was difficult for a single modeling method to establish surrogate model with high accuracy for the LNAPL contamination multiphase flow simulation model (MFSM). To give full play to advantages of single surrogate model and improve the accuracy of the surrogate model to the MFSM, a combination of deep belief neural network (DBNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was used to establish artificial intelligence ensemble surrogate model (AIESM) for the MFSM. At the same time, to reduce the influence of noise in observed concentrations on the accuracy of the identification results, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet analysis methods were used to denoise the observed concentrations, and their noise reduction effects were compared. The observed concentrations with better noise reduction effect and the observed concentrations without denoising were used to construct the objective function, and constraints of the optimization model were determined meanwhile. Then, the objective function and the constraints were integrated to build the optimization model to identify GCS and simulation model parameters. Applying the AIESM instead of the MFSM to embed in the optimization model and participate in the iterative calculation. Finally, the genetic algorithm (GA) was used to solve the optimization model to obtain the identification results of GCS and simulation model parameters. The results showed that compared with the single DBNN and LSTM surrogate models, AIESM obtained the highest accuracy and could replace the MFSM to participate in the iterative calculation, thereby reducing the calculation load and calculation time by more than 99%. Comparing with the wavelet analysis, EMD could reduce the noise in the concentrations more effectively, improved the accuracy of the approximated concentrations to the actual values, and increased the accuracy of the GCSs identification results by 1.45%.", "Given the paucity of antiviral treatments for monkeypox disease, caused by the Monkeypox virus (MPXV), there is a pressing need for the development/identification of new drugs to treat the infection. MPXV possesses a linear dsDNA genome that is replicated by a DNA replication complex of which DNA polymerase (DPol) forms an important component. Owing to the importance of DPol in the viral life cycle, identifying/designing small molecules abolishing its function could yield new antivirals. In this study, we first used the AlphaFold artificial intelligence program to model the 3D structure of the MPXV DPol; like the fold of DPol from other organisms, the MPXV DPol structure has the characteristic exonuclease, thumb, palm, and fingers sub-domains arrangement. Subsequently, we have identified several inhibitors through virtual screening of ZINC and antiviral libraries. Molecules with phenyl scaffold along with alanine-based and tetrazole-based molecules showed the best docking score of -8 to -10\u00a0kcal/mol. These molecules bind in the palm and fingers sub-domains interface region, which partially overlaps with the DNA binding path. The delineation of DPol/inhibitor interactions showed that majorly active site residues ASP549, ASP753, TYR550, ASN551, SER552, and ASN665 interact with the inhibitors. These compounds exhibit good Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion properties.", "Artificial intelligence is currently being used to facilitate early disease detection, better understand disease progression, optimize medication/treatment dosages, and uncover promising novel treatments and potential outcomes.\nUtilizing the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) dataset, we built a machine learning model to predict depression remission rates using same clinical data as features for each of the first three antidepressant treatment steps in STAR*D. We only used early treatment data (baseline and first follow up) in each STAR*D step to temporally analyze predictive features of remission at the end of the step.\nOur model showed significant prediction performance across the three treatment steps, At step 1, Model accuracy was 66\u00a0%; sensitivity-65\u00a0%, specificity-67\u00a0%, positive predictive value (PPV)-65.5\u00a0%, and negative predictive value (NPV)-66.6\u00a0%. At step 2, model accuracy was 71.3\u00a0%, sensitivity-74.3\u00a0%, specificity-69\u00a0%, PPV-64.5\u00a0%, and NPV-77.9\u00a0%. At step 3, accuracy reached 84.6\u00a0%; sensitivity-69\u00a0%, specificity-88.8\u00a0%, PPV-67\u00a0%, and NPV-91.1\u00a0%. Across all three steps, the early Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR) scores were key elements in predicting the final treatment outcome. The model also identified key sociodemographic factors that predicted treatment remission at different steps.\nThe retrospective design, lack of replication in an independent dataset, and the use of \"a complete case analysis\" model in our analysis.\nThis proof-of-concept study showed that using early treatment data, multi-step temporal prediction of depressive symptom remission results in clinically useful accuracy rates. Whether these predictive models are generalizable deserves further study.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly adopted in the health care industry for administrative tasks, patient care operations, and medical research.\nWe aimed to examine health care workers' opinions about the adoption and implementation of AI-powered technology in the health care industry.\nData were comments about AI posted on a web-based forum by 905 health care professionals from at least 77 countries, from May 2013 to October 2021. Structural topic modeling was used to identify the topics of discussion, and hierarchical clustering was performed to determine how these topics cluster into different groups.\nOverall, 12 topics were identified from the collected comments. These comments clustered into 2 groups: impact of AI on health care system and practice and AI as a tool for disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Topics associated with negative sentiments included concerns about AI replacing human workers, impact of AI on traditional medical diagnostic procedures (ie, patient history and physical examination), accuracy of the algorithm, and entry of IT companies into the health care industry. Concerns about the legal liability for using AI in treating patients were also discussed. Positive topics about AI included the opportunity offered by the technology for improving the accuracy of image-based diagnosis and for enhancing personalized medicine.\nThe adoption and implementation of AI applications in the health care industry are eliciting both enthusiasm and concerns about patient care quality and the future of health care professions. The successful implementation of AI-powered technologies requires the involvement of all stakeholders, including patients, health care organization workers, health insurance companies, and government regulatory agencies.", "S-Detect is a computer-assisted, artificial intelligence-based system of image analysis that has been integrated into the software of ultrasound (US) equipment and has the capacity to independently differentiate between benign and malignant focal breast lesions. Since the revision and upgrade in both the breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) US lexicon and the S-Detect software in 2013, evidence that supports improved accuracy and specificity of radiologists' assessment of breast lesions has accumulated. However, such assessment using S-Detect technology to distinguish malignant from breast lesions with a diameter no greater than 2\u00a0cm requires further investigation.\nThe US images of focal breast lesions from 295 patients in our hospital from January 2019 to June 2022 were collected. The BI-RADS data were evaluated by the embedded program and as manually modified prior to the determination of a pathological diagnosis. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to compare the diagnostic accuracy between the assessments of the conventional US images, the S-Detect classification, and the combination of the two.\nThere were 326 lesions identified in 295 patients, of which pathological confirmation demonstrated that 239 were benign and 87 were malignant. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the conventional imaging group were 75.86%, 93.31%, and 88.65%. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the S-Detect classification group were 87.36%, 88.28%, and 88.04%, respectively. The assessment of the amended combination of S-Detect with US image analysis (Co-Detect group) was improved with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 90.80%, 94.56%, and 93.56%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of the conventional US group, the S-Detect group, and the Co-Detect group using area under curves was 0.85, 0.88 and 0.93, respectively. The Co-Detect group had a better diagnostic efficiency compared with the conventional US group (Z = 3.882, p = 0.0001) and the S-Detect group (Z = 3.861, p = 0.0001). There was no significant difference in distinguishing benign from malignant small breast lesions when comparing conventional US and S-Detect techniques.\nThe addition of S-Detect technology to conventional US imaging provided a novel and feasible method to differentiate benign from malignant small breast nodules.", "Reduced audit quality behavior is widespread in the auditor's practice and is an important factor threatening audit quality. Some prior studies have investigated the relationship between auditors' psychological contract violation and reduced audit quality behavior. However, the research of relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and auditors' behavior is still in its infancy despite the fact that the auditing profession would benefit greatly from improving audit team's EI. This study examines whether and why the audit team's EI restrains the audit quality reduction behavior in audit firms. In the study, our hypotheses are tested using a data set collected from 326 respondents in Chinese audit firms. The results are as follows: firstly, audit team's EI is directly negatively related to reduced audit quality behavior. Secondly, EI is indirectly related to reduced audit quality behavior, through team trust. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) indicate a mediation model where team trust is negatively related to reduced audit quality behavior. Thirdly, knowledge sharing is a significant mechanism that moderates the effects of different types of EI on audit quality reduction behavior. In the audit team with high knowledge sharing, the audit team's EI can refrain the audit quality reduction behavior; In the audit team with low knowledge sharing, the audit team's EI has no significant effect on audit quality reduction behavior. This study expands the factors affecting audit quality to the psychological level of audit teams, enriches the literature on audit team's behavior characteristics, and provides direct evidence for the relationship between audit team's psychological characteristics and audit quality.", "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of computer vision and currently constitute some of the best models for representations learned via hierarchical processing in the human brain. In medical imaging, these models have shown human-level performance and even higher in the early diagnosis of a wide range of diseases. However, the goal is often not only to accurately predict group membership or diagnose but also to provide explanations that support the model decision in a context that a human can readily interpret. The limited transparency has hindered the adoption of DNN algorithms across many domains. Numerous explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques have been developed to peer inside the \"black box\" and make sense of DNN models, taking somewhat divergent approaches. Here, we suggest that these methods may be considered in light of the interpretation goal, including functional or mechanistic interpretations, developing archetypal class instances, or assessing the relevance of certain features or mappings on a trained model in a post-hoc capacity. We then focus on reviewing recent applications of post-hoc relevance techniques as applied to neuroimaging data. Moreover, this article suggests a method for comparing the reliability of XAI methods, especially in deep neural networks, along with their advantages and pitfalls.", "Because spectral technology has exhibited benefits in food-related applications, an increasing amount of effort is being dedicated to develop new food-related spectral technologies. In recent years, the use of remote sensing or unmanned aerial vehicles for precision agriculture has increased. As spectral technology continues to improve, portable spectral devices become available in the market, offering the possibility of realising in-field monitoring. This study demonstrates hyperspectral imaging and spectral olive signatures of the Manzanilla and Gordal cultivars analysed throughout the table-olive season from May to September. The data were acquired using an in-field technique and sampled via a non-destructive approach. The olives were monitored periodically during the season using a hyperspectral camera. A white reference was used to normalise the illumination variability in the spectra. The acquired data were saved in files named raw, normalised, and processed data. The normalised data were calculated by the sensor by correcting the white and black levels using the acquired reflectance values. The olive spectral signature of the images is saved in the processed data files. The images were labelled and processed using an algorithm to retrieve the olive spectral signatures. The results were stored as a chart with 204 columns and 'n' rows. Each row represents the pixel of an olive in the image, and the columns contain the reflectance information at that specific band. These data provide information about two olive cultivars during the season, which can be used for various research purposes. Statistical and artificial intelligence approaches correlate spectral signatures with olive characteristics such as growth level, organoleptic properties, or even cultivar classification.", "Knee joint distraction (KJD) has been associated with clinical and structural improvement and SF marker changes. The current objective was to analyse radiographic changes after KJD using an automatic artificial intelligence-based measurement method and relate these to clinical outcome and SF markers.\nTwenty knee osteoarthritis patients were treated with KJD in regular care. Radiographs and WOMAC were collected before and \u223c1\u2009year post-treatment. SF was aspirated before, during and after treatment; biomarker levels were assessed by immunoassay. Radiographs were analysed to obtain compartmental minimum and standardized joint space width (JSW), Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grades, compartmental joint space narrowing (JSN) scores, and osteophytosis and sclerosis scores. Results were analysed for the most affected compartment (MAC) and least affected compartment. Radiographic changes were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for categorical and paired t-test for continuous variables. Linear regression was used to calculate associations between changes in JSW, WOMAC pain and SF markers.\nSixteen patients could be evaluated. JSW, KL and JSN improved in around half of the patients, significant only for MAC JSW (P\u2009<\u20090.05). MAC JSW change was positively associated with WOMAC pain change (P\u2009<\u20090.04). Greater monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and lower TGF\u03b2-1 increases were significantly associated with changes in MAC JSW (P\u2009<\u20090.05). MCP-1 changes were positively associated with WOMAC pain changes (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nAutomatic radiographic measurements show improved joint structure in most patients after KJD in regular care. MAC JSW increased significantly and was associated with SF biomarker level changes and even with improvements in pain as experienced by these patients.", "To investigate the relationship between spiritual well-being and spiritual intelligence with mental health in students.\nThis descriptive-analytical study was conducted among 277 students (110 boys and 167 girls) through convenience sampling. The data collection instruments in this study included a spiritual well-being questionnaire, King's spiritual intelligence questionnaire, and Goldberg's general health questionnaire. After being entered into SPSS statistical software, the data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical.\nThe results of multivariate regression analysis using the step-by-step method showed that spiritual well-being predicts 14% of the variance of students' mental health. Also, on the scale of spiritual well-being, the two dimensions of communication with oneself and communication with others were predictors for the social functioning dimension of mental health. Also, among the subscales of spiritual well-being, the subscale of connection with God had an inverse and significant relationship with anxiety and physical health (p<0.05), and an inverse and significant relationship were observed between the subscale of connection with self with anxiety and depression (p<0.05).\nThe results of the present study confirm that spiritual well-being and spiritual intelligence affect mental health and its dimensions.", "There is an unmet need for fully automated image prescription of the liver to enable efficient, reproducible MRI.\nTo develop and evaluate artificial intelligence (AI)-based liver image prescription.\nProspective.\nA total of 570 female/469 male patients (age: 56\u2009\u00b1\u200917\u2009years) with 72%/8%/20% assigned randomly for training/validation/testing; two female/four male healthy volunteers (age: 31\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u2009years).\n1.5\u2009T, 3.0\u2009T; spin echo, gradient echo, bSSFP.\nA total of 1039 three-plane localizer acquisitions (26,929 slices) from consecutive clinical liver MRI examinations were retrieved retrospectively and annotated by six radiologists. The localizer images and manual annotations were used to train an object-detection convolutional neural network (YOLOv3) to detect multiple object classes (liver, torso, and arms) across localizer image orientations and to output corresponding 2D bounding boxes. Whole-liver image prescription in standard orientations was obtained based on these bounding boxes. 2D detection performance was evaluated on test datasets by calculating intersection over union (IoU) between manual and automated labeling. 3D prescription accuracy was calculated by measuring the boundary mismatch in each dimension and percentage of manual volume covered by AI prescription. The automated prescription was implemented on a 3\u00a0T MR system and evaluated prospectively on healthy volunteers.\nPaired t-tests (threshold\u00a0=\u00a00.05) were conducted to evaluate significance of performance difference between trained networks.\nIn 208 testing datasets, the proposed method with full network had excellent agreement with manual annotations, with median IoU\u2009>\u20090.91 (interquartile range\u2009<\u20090.09) across all seven classes. The automated 3D prescription was accurate, with shifts <2.3\u00a0cm in superior/inferior dimension for 3D axial prescription for 99.5% of test datasets, comparable to radiologists' interreader reproducibility. The full network had significantly superior performance than the tiny network for 3D axial prescription in patients. Automated prescription performed well across single-shot fast spin-echo, gradient-echo, and balanced steady-state free-precession sequences in the prospective study.\nAI-based automated liver image prescription demonstrated promising performance across the patients, pathologies, and field strengths studied.\n4.\nStage 1.", "The aim of the study was to assess the main epidemiological characteristics of AML (morbidity, survival, distribution by AML variants and age groups) in 5 regions participating in the study.\nThis stat study was conducted on patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in 5 regions of Kazakhstan, from January 2017 to December 2020. Compared with self-assessment of acute myeloid leukemia using a questionnaire, postoperative histopathology in patients with suspected acute myeloid leukemia. The questionnaire, compiled by artificial intelligence, is grouped into categories \"risk\" and \"no risk\". Statistical processing and analysis of data was carried out using the analytical package SAS 9.4. Methods of reporting statistics, standardization of morbidity were used.\nAccording to the standardized morbidity indicators obtained (from 1.39 to 2.43 per 100 thousand population), we can say that the registered incidence of AML remains low. This value practically does not differ from the incidence of AML (2.71) according to the Kazakhstan Cancer Registry for 2016 and is significantly lower than the data of European and American registries (4-5 cases per 100 thousand inhabitants per year).\nThis study identified specific areas with a high risk of acute myeloid leukemia in Eastern Kazakhstan, as well as spatial inequality in their distribution with the formation of this disease. These results can be useful in developing any strategy for responding to a high risk of cancer in specific areas.", "While the organizational factors that account for firefighters' burnout have been extensively explored, the individual factors related to how they regulate interpersonal conflicts and emotions remain to be investigated. Previous research has demonstrated the association between emotional intelligence and conflict management styles and burnout, but no study has looked at the interrelationships among these factors in high-risk sectors. The present exploratory study aimed to fill this research gap by investigating the relationships between conflict management style, emotional intelligence and burnout in a sample of firefighters.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted with 240 French firefighters. Measures comprised validated scales of conflict management styles, emotional intelligence and burnout.\nResults showed that the integrating conflict style reduced burnout. They also revealed the effects of emotion regulation on burnout, whereby the awareness and management of one's own emotions reduced burnout. Moreover, awareness of one's own emotions moderated the relationship between integrating conflict resolution style and burnout, whereby the effect of integrating style on reduced burnout was higher when awareness of one's own emotions was high.\nThese results reveal that strategies used by firefighters to regulate their emotions in order to meet the emotional demands specific to their job are important for reducing the emotional exhaustion component of burnout. Training programs for conflict and emotion management are needed to preserve the mental health of firefighters and ensure the safety of interventions.", "As the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) continues to expand in healthcare, much attention has been given to mitigating bias in algorithms to ensure they are employed fairly and transparently. Less attention has fallen to addressing potential bias among AI/ML's human users or factors that influence user reliance. We argue for a systematic approach to identifying the existence and impacts of user biases while using AI/ML tools and call for the development of embedded interface design features, drawing on insights from decision science and behavioral economics, to nudge users towards more critical and reflective decision making using AI/ML.", "The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing worldwide. If detected early, melanoma is highly treatable, so early detection is vital.Skin cancer early detection has improved significantly in recent decades, for example by the introduction of screening in 2008 and dermoscopy. Nevertheless, in particular visual detection of early melanomas remains challenging because they show many morphological overlaps with nevi. Hence, there continues to be a high medical need to further develop methods for early skin cancer detection in order to be able to reliably diagnosemelanomas at a very early stage.Routine diagnostics for melanoma detection include visual whole body inspection, often supplemented by dermoscopy, which can significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy of experienced dermatologists. A procedure that is additionally offered in some practices and clinics is wholebody photography combined with digital dermoscopy for the early detection of malignant melanoma, especially for monitoring high-risk patients.In recent decades, numerous noninvasive adjunctive diagnostic techniques were developed for the examination of suspicious pigmented moles, that may have the potential to allow improved and, in some cases, automated evaluation of these lesions. First, confocal laser microscopy should be mentioned here, as well as electrical impedance spectroscopy, multiphoton laser tomography, multispectral analysis, Raman spectroscopy or optical coherence tomography. These diagnostic techniques usually focus on high sensitivity to avoid malignant melanoma being overlooked. However, this usually implies lower specificity, which may lead to unnecessary excision of benign lesions in screening. Also, some of the procedures are time-consuming and costly, which also limits their applicability in skin cancer screening. In the near future, the use of artificial intelligence might change skin cancer diagnostics in many ways. The most promising approach may be the analysis of routine macroscopic and dermoscopic images by artificial intelligence.For the classification of pigmented skin lesions based on macroscopic and dermoscopic images, artificial intelligence, especially in form of neural networks, has achieved comparable diagnostic accuracies to dermatologists under experimental conditions in numerous studies. In particular, it achieved high accuracies in the binary melanoma/nevus classification task, but it also performed comparably well to dermatologists in multiclass differentiation of various skin diseases. However, proof of the basic applicability and utility of such systems in clinical practice is still pending. Prerequisites that remain to be established to enable translation of such diagnostic systems into dermatological routine are means that allow users to comprehend the system's decisions as well as a uniformly high performance of the algorithms on image data from other hospitals and practices.At present, hints are accumulating that computer-aided diagnosis systems could provide their greatest benefit as assistance systems, since studies indicate that a combination of human and machine achieves the best results. Diagnostic systems based on artificial intelligence are capable of detecting morphological characteristics quickly, quantitatively, objectively and reproducibly, and could thus provide a more objective analytical basis - in addition to medical experience.\nWeltweit steigt die Inzidenz des malignen Melanoms an. Bei fr\u00fchzeitiger Erkennung ist das Melanom gut behandelbar, eine Fr\u00fcherkennung ist also lebenswichtig.Die Hautkrebs-Fr\u00fcherkennung hat sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten bspw. durch die Einf\u00fchrung des Screenings im Jahr 2008 und die Dermatoskopie deutlich verbessert. Dennoch bleibt die visuelle Erkennung insbesondere von fr\u00fchen Melanomen eine Herausforderung, weil diese viele morphologische \u00dcberlappungen mit N\u00e4vi zeigen. Daher ist der medizinische Bedarf weiterhin hoch, die Methoden zur Hautkrebsfr\u00fcherkennung gezielt weiterzuentwickeln, um Melanome bereits in einem sehr fr\u00fchen Stadium sicher diagnostizieren zu k\u00f6nnen.Die Routinediagnostik zur Hautkrebs-Fr\u00fcherkennung umfasst die visuelle Ganzk\u00f6rperinspektion, oft erg\u00e4nzt durch die Dermatoskopie, durch die sich die diagnostische Treffsicherheit erfahrener Haut\u00e4rzte deutlich erh\u00f6hen l\u00e4sst. Ein Verfahren, was in einigen Praxen und Kliniken zus\u00e4tzlich angeboten wird, ist die kombinierte Ganzk\u00f6rperfotografie mit der digitalen Dermatoskopie f\u00fcr die Fr\u00fcherkennung maligner Melanome, insbesondere f\u00fcr das Monitoring von Hochrisiko-Patienten.In den letzten Jahrzenten wurden zahlreiche nicht invasive zusatzdiagnostische Verfahren zur Beurteilung verd\u00e4chtiger Pigmentmale entwickelt, die das Potenzial haben k\u00f6nnten, eine verbesserte und z. T. automatisierte Bewertung dieser L\u00e4sionen zu erm\u00f6glichen. In erster Linie ist hier die konfokale Lasermikroskopie zu nennen, ebenso die elektrische Impedanzspektroskopie, die Multiphotonen-Lasertomografie, die Multispektralanalyse, die Raman-Spektroskopie oder die optische Koh\u00e4renztomografie. Diese diagnostischen Verfahren fokussieren i. d. R. auf hohe Sensitivit\u00e4t, um zu vermeiden, ein malignes Melanom zu \u00fcbersehen. Dies bedingt allerdings \u00fcblicherweise eine geringere Spezifit\u00e4t, was im Screening zu unn\u00f6tigen Exzisionen vieler gutartiger L\u00e4sionen f\u00fchren kann. Auch sind einige der Verfahren zeitaufwendig und kostenintensiv,was die Anwendbarkeit im Screening ebenfalls einschr\u00e4nkt.In naher Zukunft wird insbesondere die Nutzung von k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz die Diagnosefindung in vielf\u00e4ltiger Weise ver\u00e4ndern. Vielversprechend ist v. a. die Analyse der makroskopischen und dermatoskopischen Routine-Bilder durch k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz. F\u00fcr die Klassifizierung von pigmentierten Hautl\u00e4sionen anhand makroskopischer und dermatoskopischer Bilder erzielte die k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz v. a. in Form neuronaler Netze unter experimentellen Bedingungen in zahlreichen Studien bereits eine vergleichbare diagnostische Genauigkeit wie Dermatologen. Insbesondere bei der bin\u00e4ren Klassifikationsaufgabe Melanom/N\u00e4vus erreichte sie hohe Genauigkeiten, doch auch in der Multiklassen-Differenzierung von verschiedenen Hauterkrankungen zeigt sie sich vergleichbar gut wie Dermatologen. Der Nachweis der grunds\u00e4tzlichen Anwendbarkeit und des Nutzens solcher Systeme in der klinischen Praxis steht jedoch noch aus. Noch zu schaffende Grundvoraussetzungen f\u00fcr die Translation solcher Diagnosesysteme in die dermatologischen Routine sind M\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr die Nutzer, die Entscheidungen des Systems nachzuvollziehen, sowie eine gleichbleibend gute Leistung der Algorithmen auf Bilddaten aus fremden Kliniken und Praxen.Derzeit zeichnet sich ab, dass computergest\u00fctzte Diagnosesysteme als Assistenzsysteme den gr\u00f6\u00dften Nutzen bringen k\u00f6nnten, denn Studien deuten darauf hin, dass eine Kombination von Mensch und Maschine die besten Ergebnisse erzielt. Diagnosesysteme basierend auf k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz sind in der Lage, Merkmale schnell, quantitativ, objektiv und reproduzierbar zu erfassen, und k\u00f6nnten somit die Medizin auf eine mathematische Grundlage stellen \u2013 zus\u00e4tzlich zur \u00e4rztlichen Erfahrung.", "Digital well-being records are multimodal and high-dimensional (HD). Better theradiagnostics stem from new computationally thorough and edgy technologies, i.e., hyperspectral (HSI) imaging, super-resolution, and nanoimaging, but advance mess data portrayal and retrieval. A patient's state involves multiple signals, medical imaging (MI) modalities, clinical variables, dialogs between clinicians and patients, metadata, genome sequencing, and signals from wearables. Patients' high volume, personalized data amassed over time have advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models for higherprecision inferences, prognosis, and tracking. AI promises are undeniable, but with slow spreading and adoption, given partly unstable AI model performance after real-world use. The HD data is a ratelimiting factor for AI algorithms generalizing real-world scenarios. This paper studies many health data challenges to robust AI models' growth, aka the dimensionality curse (DC). This paper overviews DC in the MIs' context, tackles the negative out-of-sample influence and stresses important worries for algorithm designers. It is tricky to choose an AI platform and analyze hardships. Automating complex tasks requires more examination. Not all MI problems need automation via DL. AI developers spend most time refining algorithms, and quality data are crucial. Noisy and incomplete data limits AI, requiring time to handle control, integration, and analyses. AI demands data mixing skills absent in regular systems, requiring hardware/software speed and flexible storage.

The main hypothesis based on the patients receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy treatment was CTRCD risk analysis with GLS that was independent of LV ejection fraction (LVEF).\nDisplacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) MRI was acquired on 32 breast cancer patients at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups after chemotherapy. Two DeepLabV3+ Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) were deployed to automate image segmentation for LV chamber quantification and phase-unwrapping for 3D strains, computed with the Radial Point Interpolation Method. CTRCD risk (cardiotoxicity and adverse cardiac events) was analyzed with Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) models with clinical and contractile prognostic factors.\nGLS worsened from baseline to the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (-19.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1%, -16.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1%, -16.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Univariable Cox regression showed the 3-month GLS significantly associated as an agonist (hazard ratio [HR]-per-SD: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.4-3.1; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and LVEF as a protector (HR-per-SD: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.7-0.9; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) for CTRCD occurrence. Bivariable regression showed the 3-month GLS (HR-per-SD: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.4; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) as a CTRCD prognostic factor independent of other covariates, including LVEF (HR-per-SD: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.9-1.2; P\u00a0=\u00a00.9).\nThe end-point analyses proved the hypothesis that GLS is an early, independent prognosticator of incident CTRCD risk. This novel GLS-guided approach to CTRCD risk analysis could improve antineoplastic treatment with further validation in a larger clinical trial.", "The introduction of endovascular procedures has revolutionized the management of complex aortic aneurysms. Although repair has traditionally required longer operative times and increased radiation exposure compared with simple endovascular aneurysm repair, the recent introduction of three-dimensional technology has become an invaluable operative adjunct. Surgical augmented intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving tool initiated at our institution in June 2019. In our study, we sought to determine whether this technology improved patient and operator safety.\nA retrospective review of patients who had undergone endovascular repair of complex aortic aneurysms (pararenal, juxtarenal, or thoracoabdominal), type B dissection, or infrarenal (endoleak, coil placement, or renal angiography with or without intervention) at a tertiary care center from August 2015 to November 2021 was performed. Patients were stratified according to the findings from intelligent maps, which are patient-specific AI tools used in the operating room in conjunction with real-time fluoroscopic images. The primary outcomes included operative time, radiation exposure, fluoroscopy time, and contrast use. The secondary outcomes included 30-day postoperative complications and long-term follow-up. Linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between AI use and the main outcomes.\nDuring the 6-year period, 116 patients were included in the present study, with no significant differences in the baseline characteristics. Of the 116 patients, 76 (65.5%) had undergone procedures using AI and 40 (34.5%) had undergone procedures without AI software. The intraoperative outcomes revealed a significant decrease in radiation exposure (AI group, 1955\u00a0mGy; vs non-AI group, 3755\u00a0mGy; P\u00a0= .004), a significant decrease in the fluoroscopy time (AI group, 55.6\u00a0minutes; vs non-AI group, 86.9\u00a0minutes; P\u00a0= .007), a decrease in the operative time (AI group, 255\u00a0minutes; vs non-AI group, 284\u00a0minutes; P\u00a0= .294), and a significant decrease in contrast use (AI group, 123\u00a0mL; vs non-AI group, 199\u00a0mL; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). No differences were found in the 30-day and long-term outcomes.\nThe results from the present study have demonstrated that the use of AI technology combined with intraoperative imaging can significantly facilitate complex endovascular aneurysm repair by decreasing the operative time, radiation exposure, fluoroscopy time, and contrast use. Overall, evolving technology such as AI has improved radiation safety for both the patient and the entire operating room team.", "Fluid intelligence is seen as a beneficial attribute, protecting against stress and ill-health. Whether intelligence provides resilience to the cognitive effects of insufficient sleep was tested in the current pre-registered experimental study. Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0182) completed the Raven's test (measuring fluid intelligence) and a normal night of sleep or a night of total sleep deprivation. Sleepiness and four cognitive tests were completed at 22:30\u2009hours (baseline), and the following day after sleep manipulation. At baseline, higher fluid intelligence was associated with faster and more accurate arithmetic calculations, and better episodic memory, but not with spatial working memory, simple attention or sleepiness. Those with higher fluid intelligence were more, not less, impacted by sleep deprivation, evident for arithmetic ability, episodic memory\u00a0and spatial working memory. We need to establish a more nuanced picture of the benefits of intelligence, where intelligence is not related to cognitive advantages in all situations.", "Although at-home coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) testing offers several benefits in a relatively cost-effective and less risky manner, evidence suggests that at-home COVID-19 test kits have a high rate of false negatives. One way to improve the accuracy and acceptance of COVID-19 screening is to combine existing at-home physical test kits with an easily accessible, electronic, self-diagnostic tool. The objective of the current study was to test the acceptability and usability of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled COVID-19 testing tool that combines a web-based symptom diagnostic screening survey and a physical at-home test kit to test differences across adults from varying races, ages, genders, educational, and income levels in the United States.\nA total of 822 people from Richmond, Virginia, were included in the study. Data were collected from employees and patients of Virginia Commonwealth University Health Center as well as the surrounding community in June through October 2021. Data were weighted to reflect the demographic distribution of patients in United States. Descriptive statistics and repeated independent t tests were run to evaluate the differences in the acceptability and usability of an AI-enabled COVID-19 testing tool.\nAcross all participants, there was a reasonable degree of acceptability and usability of the AI-enabled COVID-19 testing tool that included a physical test kit and symptom screening website. The AI-enabled COVID-19 testing tool demonstrated overall good acceptability and usability across race, age, gender, and educational background. Notably, participants preferred both components of the AI-enabled COVID-19 testing tool to the in-clinic testing.\nOverall, these findings suggest that our AI-enabled COVID-19 testing approach has great potential to improve the quality of remote COVID testing at low cost and high accessibility for diverse demographic populations in the United States.", "Industrial artificial intelligence (IAI) and other analysis tools with obfuscated internal processes are growing in capability and ubiquity within industrial settings. Decision-makers share their concern regarding the objective evaluation of such tools and their impacts at the system level, facility level, and beyond. One application where this style of tool is making a significant impact is in Condition Monitoring Systems (CMSs). This paper addresses the need to evaluate CMSs, a collection of software and devices that alert users to changing conditions within assets or systems of a facility. The presented evaluation procedure uses CMSs as a case study for a broader philosophy evaluating the impacts of IAI tools. CMSs can provide value to a system by forewarning faults, defects, or other unwanted events. However, evaluating CMS value through scenarios that did not occur is rarely easy or intuitive. Further complicating this evaluation are the ongoing investment costs and risks posed by the CMS from imperfect monitoring. To overcome this, an industrial facility needs to regularly and objectively review CMS impacts to justify investments and maintain competitive advantage. This paper's procedure assesses the suitability of a CMS for a system in terms of risk and investment analysis. This risk-based approach uses the changes in the likelihood of good and bad events to quantify CMS value without making any one-time point-wise estimates. Fictional case studies presented in this paper illustrate the procedure and demonstrate its usefulness and validity.", "There is growing concern that artificial intelligence conversational agents (e.g., Siri, Alexa) reinforce voice-based social stereotypes. Because little is known about social perceptions of conversational agents' voices, we investigated (1) the dimensions that underpin perceptions of these synthetic voices and (2) the role that acoustic parameters play in these perceptions. Study 1 (N\u2009=\u2009504) found that perceptions of synthetic voices are underpinned by Valence and Dominance components similar to those previously reported for natural human stimuli and that the Dominance component was strongly and negatively related to voice pitch. Study 2 (N\u2009=\u2009160) found that experimentally manipulating pitch in synthetic voices directly influenced dominance-related, but not valence-related, perceptions. Collectively, these results suggest that greater consideration of the role that voice pitch plays in dominance-related perceptions when designing conversational agents may be an effective method for controlling stereotypic perceptions of their voices and the downstream consequences of those perceptions.", "Artificial intelligence technology has become a mainstream trend in the development of medical informatization. Because of the complex structure and a large amount of medical data generated in the current medical informatization process, big data technology to assist doctors in scientific research and analysis and obtain high-value information has become indispensable for medical and scientific research.\nThis study aims to discuss the architecture of diabetes intelligent digital platform by analyzing existing data mining methods and platform building experience in the medical field, using a large data platform building technology utilizing the Hadoop system, model prediction, and data processing analysis methods based on the principles of statistics and machine learning. We propose three major building mechanisms, namely the medical data integration and governance mechanism (DCM), data sharing and privacy protection mechanism (DPM), and medical application and medical research mechanism (MCM), to break down the barriers between traditional medical research and digital medical research. Additionally, we built an efficient and convenient intelligent diabetes model prediction and data analysis platform for clinical research.\nResearch results from this platform are currently applied to medical research at Shanghai T Hospital. In terms of performance, the platform runs smoothly and is capable of handling massive amounts of medical data in real-time. In terms of functions, data acquisition, cleaning, and mining are all integrated into the system. Through a simple and intuitive interface operation, medical and scientific research data can be processed and analyzed conveniently and quickly.\nThe platform can serve as an auxiliary tool for medical personnel and promote the development of medical informatization and scientific research. Also, the platform may provide the opportunity to deliver evidence-based digital therapeutics and support digital healthcare services for future medicine.", "The applicability and accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted bone age assessment and adult height prediction methods in girls with early puberty are unknown.\nTo analyze the performance of AI-assisted bone age assessment methods by comparing the corresponding methods for predicted adult height with actual adult height.\nThis retrospective review included 726 girls with early puberty, 87 of whom had reached adult height at last follow-up. Bone age was evaluated using the Greulich-Pyle (GP), Tanner-Whitehouse (TW3-RUS) and China 05 RUS-CHN (RUS-CHN) methods. Predicted adult height was calculated using the China 05 (CH05), TW3 and Bayley-Pinneau (BP) methods.\nWe analyzed 1,663 left-hand radiographs, including 155 from girls who had reached adult height. In the 6-8- and 9-11-years age groups, bone age differences were smaller than those in the 12-14-years group; however, the differences between predicted adult height and actual adult height were larger than those in the 12-14-years group. TW3 overestimated adult height by 0.4\u00b12.8\u00a0cm, while CH05 and BP significantly underestimated adult height by 2.9\u00b13.6\u00a0cm and 1.3\u00b13.8\u00a0cm, respectively. TW3 yielded the highest proportion of predicted adult height within \u00b15\u00a0cm of actual adult height (92.9%), with the highest correlation between predicted and actual adult heights.\nThe differences in measured bone ages increased with increasing bone age. However, the corresponding method for predicting adult height was more accurate when the bone age was older. TW3 might be more suitable than CH05 and BP for predicting adult height in girls with early puberty. Methods for predicting adult height should be optimized for populations of the same ethnicity and disease.", "The transforaminal and interlaminar approaches are the two main surgical corridors of full endoscopic lumbar surgery. However, there are no quantifying methods for assessing the best surgical approach for each patient. This study aimed to establish an artificial intelligence (AI) model using an artificial neural network (ANN).\nPatients who underwent full endoscopic lumbar spinal surgery were enrolled in this research. Fourteen pre-operative factors were fed into the ANN. A three-layer deep neural network was constructed. Patient data were divided into the training, validation, and testing datasets.\nThere were 899 patients enrolled. The accuracy of the training, validation, and test datasets were 87.3%, 85.5%, and 85.0%, respectively. The positive predictive values for the transforaminal and interlaminar approaches were 85.1% and 89.1%, respectively. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic was 0.91. The SHapley Additive exPlanations algorithm was utilized to explain the relative importance of each factor. The surgical lumbar level was the most important factor, followed by herniated disc localization and migrating disc zone level.\nANN can effectively learn from the choice of an experienced spinal endoscopic surgeon and can accurately predict the appropriate surgical approach.", "Currently, computational materials science involves human-computer interaction through coding in software or neural networks. There is still no direct way for human intelligence endorsement. The digitalization of human intelligence should be the ultimate goal for many disciplines. In materials science, human intelligence is still irreplaceable from machine learning techniques, where humans can deal with complex correlations in the real world. We design the framework of Mateverse, a materials science computation platform based on Metaverse, which unifies human intelligence, experiment data, and theoretical simulations. In Mateverse, we intensively study the properties of H2O, including the liquid and solid phases. We show that we can optimize a new water force field (which we name TIP4P-Meta) directly from the interactions between human and visible properties of H2O. This force field is validated to be better than the conventional water model, and new ice polymorphs can be generated. We believe our platform can provide valuable hints in the paradigm upgrade in future computational materials science development.", "To develop an emotional intelligence (EI) test and evaluate its psychometrics for social and healthcare student selection.\nA cross-sectional methodological design.\nThe test was developed based on a systematic review and focus group interviews. Content validity was evaluated with expert panels, and preliminary psychometrics with two pilot studies. Descriptive statistics, correlations and item response theory were used.\nSearch was conducted in six databases 2018. Focus group interviews were conducted with educators and professionals in 2019. Expert panels with doctoral students, researchers and educators were conducted in 2020. Pilot tests with students were conducted 2020-2021. The developed test was administered to 4808 applicants 2021.\nThe test included four subscales. Correlations support the test's theoretical structure. The items were mainly easy.\nThe test assesses EI objectively and comprehensively. The item-level distractor analysis can be used for further test development.\nSocial care and healthcare students engage in clinical practice early in their studies, and these environments can be emotionally challenging. Assessing EI in student selection with adequate test can help the institutions of higher education to select the students with required abilities to succeed in the studies. The assessment of EI during student selection also provides information higher education institutions could use to develop and provide support interventions. The results may also encourage practice placements to include EI elements as learning objective. The results of this study and especially the use of IRT and detailed distractor analysis to evaluate the psychometric properties of EMI-T can benefit researchers and educators that develop or evaluate objective assessment tools with multiple choice questions.\nEmotional intelligence is important for students to enable professional interaction.", "In the field of computer science, known as artificial intelligence, algorithms imitate reasoning tasks that are typically performed by humans. The techniques that allow machines to learn and get better at tasks such as recognition and prediction, which form the basis of clinical practice, are referred to as machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. The number of artificial intelligence-and machine learnings-related publications in clinical journals has grown exponentially, driven by recent developments in computation and the accessibility of simple tools. However, clinicians are often not included in data science teams, which may limit the clinical relevance, explanability, workflow compatibility, and quality improvement of artificial intelligence solutions. Thus, this results in the language barrier between clinicians and artificial intelligence developers. Healthcare practitioners sometimes lack a basic understanding of artificial intelligence research because the approach is difficult for non-specialists to understand. Furthermore, many editors and reviewers of medical publications might not be familiar with the fundamental ideas behind these technologies, which may prevent journals from publishing high-quality artificial intelligence studies or, worse still, could allow for the publication of low-quality works. In this review, we aim to improve readers\u2019 artificial intelligence literacy and critical thinking. As a result, we concentrated on what we consider the 10 most important qualities of artificial intelligence research: valid scientific purpose, high-quality data set, robust reference standard, robust input, no information leakage, optimal bias-variance tradeoff, proper model evaluation, proven clinical utility, transparent reporting, and open science. Before designing a study, one should have defined a sound scientific purpose. Then, it should be backed by a high-quality data set, robust input, and a solid reference standard. The artificial intelligence development pipeline should prevent information leakage. For the models, optimal bias-variance tradeoff should be achieved, and generalizability assessment must be adequately performed. The clinical value of the final models must also be established. After the study, thought should be given to transparency in publishing the process and results as well as open science for sharing data, code, and models. We hope this work may improve the artificial intelligence literacy and mindset of the readers.", "In the field of construction, it has been shown that individuals with higher emotional intelligence may perform better on the job. However, it is still a question worth exploring about how emotional intelligence affects expatriate performance in international construction projects. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the relationship between expatriates' emotional intelligence and expatriate performance and explore the mediating role of self-efficacy and psychological resilience.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted in June 2021. A non-probability sampling method was used to obtain data. A total of 315 Chinese construction expatriates in 67 countries and regions around the world were evaluated using four scales: the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Connor-Davidson Resilience scale, and the Kraimer's expatriate's performance scale. The hypothesis model was tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM).\nThe results of the data analysis indicated that self-efficacy (\u03b2Indirect effect = 0.175, p<0.05) and psychological resilience (\u03b2Indirect effect = 0.112, p<0.05) served as fully mediating variables (\u03b2 Direct effect = 0.177, p=0.101), suggesting a way to explain how emotional intelligence affect the performance of contractor expatriates. The findings also suggest that self-efficacy and psychological resilience also play continuous and multiple mediating roles (\u03b2Indirect effect = 0.143, p<0.05) between emotional intelligence and expatriate performance.\nThis study attempted to investigate the mechanism of emotional intelligence's influence on expatriate performance from the perspective of individual psychological resources. The results of the study suggest that the emotional intelligence of expatriates may bring about an increase in performance levels by improving self-efficacy and psychological resilience levels. This provides a practical way to improve the performance of expatriates and a new management perspective for human resource management in international construction projects.", "MOOCs, or massive open online classes have reached hundreds of millions of people around the world in the past decade with a model of free open access learning. They are an excellent vehicle for delivering science to lifelong learners. Building on experience in designing astronomy MOOCs for Udemy and Coursera, we have created an astrobiology MOOC for Coursera called \"Astrobiology: Exploring Other Worlds\" that launched in April 2019. As of early 2022, about 9000 people have started the course, and nearly 10% of those have completed it. The average user rating is 4.9 out of 5. The core content is 10\u2009h of video lectures, divided into six modules, which cover the possibilities of life in the Solar System, the search for exoplanets, the concept of habitability, the definition of life and basics of biology, evolution of life on Earth, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Pedagogy was designed around clear learning objectives and includes quizzes, writing assignments, and a final project that draws on all the concepts presented in the course where students design their own mission to characterize exoplanets. In this study, we describe the design, implementation, and subsequent success of our 2019 astrobiology MOOC.", "Investment theories have claimed reciprocal relations between intelligence and investment traits (i.e., personality traits related to seeking out, and dealing with, cognitive challenges). However, previous research has primarily addressed the effects of investment traits on intellectual development (environmental enrichment hypothesis) and often focused on either childhood or later adulthood. The present study investigated the effects of intelligence on investment traits (environmental success hypothesis) from mid to late adolescence.\nIn a 3-year longitudinal survey (2008-2011) covering four measurement occasions, the predictive effects of both fluid and crystallized intelligence on intraindividual change in both the achievement motive (i.e., hope for success and fear of failure) and need for cognition were examined. Overall, 476 adolescents (t1 : Mage \u2009=\u200916.43, SD\u2009=\u20090.55; 51.3% girls) from Germany participated.\nSecond-order latent growth models indicated that fluid intelligence predicted a steeper growth in hope for success (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.40), but was unrelated to change in the other investment traits. Crystallized intelligence had no effects on the investment traits under study.\nThe results contribute to the research on the bidirectionality of intelligence and investment traits and add to our understanding of personality development from mid to late adolescence. Specifically, they underline the importance of nurturing hope for success especially in individuals with lower intelligence, but also show that support for the environmental success hypothesis seems to be limited to certain investment traits.", "As miniaturized solutions, mid-infrared (MIR) waveguide sensors are promising for label-free compositional detection of mixtures leveraging plentiful absorption fingerprints. However, the quantitative analysis of liquid mixtures is still challenging using MIR waveguide sensors, as the absorption spectrum overlaps for multiple organic components accompanied by strong water absorption background. Here, we present an artificial-intelligence-enhanced metamaterial waveguide sensing platform (AIMWSP) for aqueous mixture analysis in the MIR. With the sensitivity-improved metamaterial waveguide and assistance of machine learning, the MIR absorption spectra of a ternary mixture in water can be successfully distinguished and decomposed to single-component spectra for predicting concentration. A classification accuracy of 98.88% for 64 mixing ratios and 92.86% for four concentrations below the limit of detection (972 ppm, based on 3\u03c3) with steps of 300 ppm are realized. Besides, the mixture concentration prediction with root-mean-squared error varying from 0.107 vol % to 1.436 vol % is also achieved. Our work indicates the potential of further extending this sensing platform to MIR spectrometer-on-chip aiming for the data analytics of multiple organic components in aqueous environments.", "This study aimed to explore whether explainable Artificial Intelligence methods can be fruitfully used to improve the medical management of patients suffering from complex diseases, and in particular to predict the death risk in hospitalized patients with SARS-Cov-2 based on admission data.\nThis work is based on an observational ambispective study that comprised patients older than 18 years with a positive SARS-Cov-2 diagnosis that were admitted to the hospital Azienda Ospedaliera \"SS Antonio e Biagio e Cesare Arrigo\", Alessandria, Italy from February, 24 2020 to May, 31 2021, and that completed the disease treatment inside this structure. The patients'medical history, demographic, epidemiologic and clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records system and paper based medical records, entered and managed by the Clinical Study Coordinators using the REDCap electronic data capture tool patient chart. The dataset was used to train and to evaluate predictive ML models.\nWe overall trained, analysed and evaluated 19 predictive models (both supervised and unsupervised) on data from 824 patients described by 43 features. We focused our attention on models that provide an explanation that is understandable and directly usable by domain experts, and compared the results against other classical machine learning approaches. Among the former, JRIP showed the best performance in 10-fold cross validation, and the best average performance in a further validation test using a different patient dataset from the beginning of the third COVID-19 wave. Moreover, JRIP showed comparable performances with other approaches that do not provide a clear and/or understandable explanation.\nThe ML supervised models showed to correctly discern between low-risk and high-risk patients, even when the medical disease context is complex and the list of features is limited to information available at admission time. Furthermore, the models demonstrated to reasonably perform on a dataset from the third COVID-19 wave that was not used in the training phase. Overall, these results are remarkable: (i) from a medical point of view, these models evaluate good predictions despite the possible differences entitled with different care protocols and the possible influence of other viral variants (i.e. delta variant); (ii) from the organizational point of view, they could be used to optimize the management of health-care path at the admission time.", "Fluid intelligence is arguably the defining feature of human cognition. Yet the nature of its relationship with the brain remains a contentious topic. Influential proposals drawing primarily on functional imaging data have implicated 'multiple demand' frontoparietal and more widely distributed cortical networks, but extant lesion-deficit studies with greater causal power are almost all small, methodologically constrained, and inconclusive. The task demands large samples of patients, comprehensive investigation of performance, fine-grained anatomical mapping, and robust lesion-deficit inference, yet to be brought to bear on it. We assessed 165 healthy controls and 227 frontal or non-frontal patients with unilateral brain lesions on the best-established test of fluid intelligence, Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, employing an array of lesion-deficit inferential models responsive to the potentially distributed nature of fluid intelligence. Non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block models were used to reveal the community structure of lesion deficit networks, disentangling functional from confounding pathological distributed effects. Impaired performance was confined to patients with frontal lesions [F(2,387) = 18.491; P < 0.001; frontal worse than non-frontal and healthy participants P < 0.01, P <0.001], more marked on the right than left [F(4,385) = 12.237; P < 0.001; right worse than left and healthy participants P < 0.01, P < 0.001]. Patients with non-frontal lesions were indistinguishable from controls and showed no modulation by laterality. Neither the presence nor the extent of multiple demand network involvement affected performance. Both conventional network-based statistics and non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block modelling heavily implicated the right frontal lobe. Crucially, this localization was confirmed on explicitly disentangling functional from pathology-driven effects within a layered stochastic block model, prominently highlighting a right frontal network involving middle and inferior frontal gyrus, pre- and post-central gyri, with a weak contribution from right superior parietal lobule. Similar results were obtained with standard lesion-deficit analyses. Our study represents the first large-scale investigation of the distributed neural substrates of fluid intelligence in the focally injured brain. Combining novel graph-based lesion-deficit mapping with detailed investigation of cognitive performance in a large sample of patients provides crucial information about the neural basis of intelligence. Our findings indicate that a set of predominantly right frontal regions, rather than a more widely distributed network, is critical to the high-level functions involved in fluid intelligence. Further they suggest that Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices is a useful clinical index of fluid intelligence and a sensitive marker of right frontal lobe dysfunction.", "Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was born from the combination of a high-frequency ultrasound probe with an endoscope to assess in detail the walls of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and surrounding organs and structures. The subsequent possibility of EUS-guided tissue acquisition has rapidly established the irreplaceable role of EUS in the management of a wide range of benign and malignant gastrointestinal diseases. The actual diagnostic armamentarium involving fine-Doppler, elastography, and contrast enhancement has significantly improved its diagnostic yield, which could be even more refined by newer ways of interrogating data and images, such as artificial intelligence. Technological development (e.g., new echendoscopes, larger operative channels, special-design needles, lumen apposing metal stents, and dedicated biliary stents) and the clinical need for new, more effective, and less-invasive procedures has rapidly evolved EUS from a purely diagnostic tool to a therapeutic modality, that is making increasingly outdated some surgical or radiological procedures that have hitherto been considered standard of care.", "With the increasing survival of premature infants, there is an increased demand to provide adequate retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) services. Wide field retinal imaging (WFDRI) and artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promise in the field of ROP and have the potential to improve the diagnostic performance and reduce the workload for screening ophthalmologists. The aim of this review is to systematically review and provide a summary of the diagnostic characteristics of existing deep learning algorithms.\nTwo authors independently searched the literature, and studies using a deep learning system from retinal imaging were included. Data were extracted, assessed and reported using PRISMA guidelines.\nTwenty-seven studies were included in this review. Nineteen studies used AI systems to diagnose ROP, classify the staging of ROP, diagnose the presence of pre-plus or plus disease, or assess the quality of retinal images. The included studies reported a sensitivity of 71%-100%, specificity of 74-99% and area under the curve of 91-99% for the primary outcome of the study. AI techniques were comparable to the assessment of ophthalmologists in terms of overall accuracy and sensitivity. Eight studies evaluated vascular severity scores and were able to accurately differentiate severity using an automated classification score.\nArtificial intelligence for ROP diagnosis is a growing field, and many potential utilities have already been identified, including the presence of plus disease, staging of disease and a new automated severity score. AI has a role as an adjunct to clinical assessment; however, there is insufficient evidence to support its use as a sole diagnostic tool currently.", "Cognitive impairment and affective symptoms are hallmark features of patients with schizophrenia. This study determines whether a computerized working memory training program improves the patient's working memory and affective perception.\nThirty-nine male patients with schizophrenia, aged 25-65, participated in this study. The study uses a single-blind randomized controlled design. Twenty subjects were assigned to the experimental group and received an eight-week working memory computerized training course comprising four modules of the CogniPlus system. Nineteen subjects were assigned to the control group and received treatment as usual. All subjects received the same assessments twice, including the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Working Memory Index (WMI) of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition, and the subjective rating of pictures of the International affective picture system by Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM).\nThis study shows that computerized working memory training improves WMI and the score for MMSE and produces a significant increase in the pleasure score for S.A.M. for negative pictures, between the pretest and post-test for the experimental group.\nWorking memory training improves working memory and emotion perception for patients with chronic schizophrenia and normal cognition. The limitations of this study and suggestions for future study are also discussed.", "A microscopic image has been used in cell analysis for cell type identification and classification, cell counting and cell size measurement. Most previous research works are tedious, including detailed understanding and time-consuming. The scientists and researchers are seeking modern and automatic cell analysis approaches in line with the current in-demand technology.\nThis article provides a brief overview of a general cell and specific stem cell analysis approaches from the history of cell discovery up to the state-of-the-art approaches.\nA content description of the literature study has been surveyed from specific manuscript databases using three review methods: manuscript identification, screening, and inclusion. This review methodology is based on Prism guidelines in searching for originality and novelty in studies concerning cell analysis.\nBy analysing generic cell and specific stem cell analysis approaches, current technology offers tremendous potential in assisting medical experts in performing cell analysis using a method that is less laborious, cost-effective, and reduces error rates.\nThis review uncovers potential research gaps concerning generic cell and specific stem cell analysis. Thus, it could be a reference for developing automated cells analysis approaches using current technology such as artificial intelligence and deep learning.", "Classic design of experiment relies on a time-intensive workflow that requires planning, data interpretation, and hypothesis building by experienced researchers. Here, we describe an integrated, machine-intelligent experimental system which enables simultaneous dynamic tests of electrical, optical, gravimetric, and viscoelastic properties of materials under a programmable dynamic environment. Specially designed software controls the experiment and performs on-the-fly extensive data analysis and dynamic modeling, real-time iterative feedback for dynamic control of experimental conditions, and rapid visualization of experimental results. The system operates with minimal human intervention and enables time-efficient characterization of complex dynamic multifunctional environmental responses of materials with simultaneous data processing and analytics. The system provides a viable platform for artificial intelligence (AI)-centered material characterization, which, when coupled with an AI-controlled synthesis system, could lead to accelerated discovery of multifunctional materials.", "This Viewpoint discusses the opportunities and risks of using 3 main areas of artificial intelligence in surgery: computer vision, digital transformation at the point of care, and electronic health records data.", "The normalization of epidemic prevention and control has exacerbated nurses' physical and mental stresses. The important role of physical activity in relieving nurses' physical and mental stresses has received extensive attention from researchers in recent years. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of physical activity on the regulatory emotional self-efficacy, resilience, and emotional intelligence of nurses and explain their interactions. The present study adopted the cluster sampling method. From April to May 2022, a total of 500 nurses in six municipal hospitals in Changsha City were selected. Finally, 402 valid data samples were obtained. Afterward, AMOS 23.0 (by maximum likelihood estimation) was used to process the collected data and analyze the proposed hypotheses by using 5,000 bootstrap samples to test the mediating effects of the structural equation model. The results demonstrated that there are positive correlations between physical activity and resilience (standardized coefficients\u2009=\u20090.232, p <\u20090.001), resilience and regulatory emotional self-efficacy (standardized coefficients\u2009=\u20090.449, p <\u20090.001), and emotional intelligence and regulatory emotional self-efficacy (standardized coefficients\u2009=\u20090.330, p <\u20090.001). The positive influence of physical activity on emotional regulation self-efficacy is completely mediated by emotional intelligence and resilience (standardized indirect effect\u2009=\u20090.237, p <\u20090.01), and this explanatory power is far higher than any previous study (R 2\u2009=\u20090.49). The positive emotions generated by an individual's physical activity have an important explanatory role for individuals who want to establish more emotional regulation self-efficacy, emotional intelligence, and psychological resilience.", "Non-invasive cardiac imaging has a growing role in diagnosis, differential diagnosis, therapy planning, and follow-up in children and adolescents with congenital and acquired cardiac diseases. This review is based on a systematic analysis of international peer-reviewed articles and additionally presents own clinical experiences. It provides an overview of technical advances, emerging clinical applications, and the aspect of artificial intelligence.\nThe main imaging modalities are echocardiography, CT, and MRI. For echocardiography, strain imaging allows a novel non-invasive assessment of tissue integrity, 3D imaging rapid holistic overviews of anatomy. Fast cardiac CT imaging new techniques-especially for coronary assessment as the main clinical indication-have significantly improved spatial and temporal resolution in adjunct with a major reduction in ionizing dose. For cardiac MRI, assessment of tissue integrity even without contrast agent application by mapping sequences is a major technical breakthrough. Fetal cardiac MRI is an emerging technology, which allows structural and functional assessment of fetal hearts including even 4D flow analyses. Last but not least, artificial intelligence will play an important role for improvements of data acquisition and interpretation in the near future.\nNon-invasive cardiac imaging plays an integral part in the workup of children with heart disease. In recent years, its main application congenital heart disease has been widened for acquired cardiac diseases.", "The synergistic interaction of vision and olfaction is critical for both natural and artificial intelligence systems to recognize and adapt to complex environments. However, current bioinspired systems with visual and olfactory sensations are mostly assembled with separate and heterogeneous sensors, inevitably leading to bulky systems and incompatible datasets. Here, we demonstrate on-chip integration of visual and olfactory sensations through a dual-focus imaging approach. By combining lens-based visual imaging and lensless colorimetric imaging, a target object and its odor fingerprint can be captured with a single complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor imager, and the obtained multimodal images are analyzed with a bionic learning architecture for information fusion and perception. To demonstrate the capability of this system, we adapted it to food detection and achieved 100% accuracy in identifying meat freshness and category with a 10 s sampling time. In addition to the highly integrated sensor design, our approach exhibits superior accuracy and efficiency in object recognition, providing a promising approach for robotic sensing and perception.", "In recent days, the quality of water in inland water bodies has been threatened by various natural and anthropogenic activities. Henceforth, the continuous monitoring of water quality is mandatory to control the pollution level in surface water bodies. In this work, remote sensing technology integrated with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm, a new technique called Spatio-Temporal Hybrid Novel Technique (STHNT), was used to predict, and monitor the chemical water quality pollution level through the Water Quality Index (WQI). The Two Bands Regression Empirical (TBRE) water quality model has been used to retrieve water quality parameters from multi-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 MSI). The Nonlinear Auto-regressive Neural Network (NARNET), which is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), was set up to predict the water quality index. Based on the model performed on the remote sensing water quality data, it is inferred that NARNET (Coefficient of determination-R2:0.9911, Root Mean Square Error-RMSE:1.693 and Sum of Squares of Error-SSE:14.33) provides significant results in predicting WQI. Therefore, the combined remote sensing technology with artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role in water resource management, which helps in reducing the pollution level in surface water bodies.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is already being successfully employed to aid the interpretation of multiple facets of burns care. In the light of the growing influence of AI, this systematic review and diagnostic test accuracy meta-analyses aim to appraise and summarise the current direction of research in this field.\nA systematic literature review was conducted of relevant studies published between 1990 and 2021, yielding 35 studies. Twelve studies were suitable for a Diagnostic Test Meta-Analyses.\nThe studies generally focussed on burn depth (Accuracy 68.9%-95.4%, Sensitivity 90.8% and Specificity 84.4%), burn segmentation (Accuracy 76.0%-99.4%, Sensitivity 97.9% and specificity 97.6%) and burn related mortality (Accuracy >90%-97.5% Sensitivity 92.9% and specificity 93.4%). Neural networks were the most common machine learning (ML) algorithm utilised in 69% of the studies. The QUADAS-2 tool identified significant heterogeneity between studies.\nThe potential application of AI in the management of burns patients is promising, especially given its propitious results across a spectrum of dimensions, including burn depth, size, mortality, related sepsis and acute kidney injuries. The accuracy of the results analysed within this study is comparable to current practices in burns care.\nThe application of AI in the treatment and management of burns patients, as a series of point of care diagnostic adjuncts, is promising. Whilst AI is a potentially valuable tool, a full evaluation of its current utility and potential is limited by significant variations in research methodology and reporting.", "The increasing application of artificial intelligence (AI) to healthcare raises both hope and ethical concerns. Some advanced machine learning methods provide accurate clinical predictions at the expense of a significant lack of explainability. Alex John London has defended that accuracy is a more important value than explainability in AI medicine. In this article, we locate the trade-off between accurate performance and explainable algorithms in the context of distributive justice. We acknowledge that accuracy is cardinal from outcome-oriented justice because it helps to maximize patients' benefits and optimizes limited resources. However, we claim that the opaqueness of the algorithmic black box and its absence of explainability threatens core commitments of procedural fairness such as accountability, avoidance of bias, and transparency. To illustrate this, we discuss liver transplantation as a case of critical medical resources in which the lack of explainability in AI-based allocation algorithms is procedurally unfair. Finally, we provide a number of ethical recommendations for when considering the use of unexplainable algorithms in the distribution of health-related resources.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting the world since December 2019, and nowadays, the number of infected is increasing rapidly. Chest X-ray images are clinical adjuncts that can be used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Because of the rapid spread of COVID-19 disease worldwide and the limited number of expert radiologists, the proposed method uses the automatic diagnosis method rather than a manual diagnosis method. In the paper, COVID-19 Positive/Negative (2275 Positive, 4626 Negative) and Normal/Pneumonia (2313 Normal, 2313 Pneumonia) are diagnosed using chest X-ray images. Herein, 80\u00a0% and 20\u00a0% of the images are used in the training and validation set, respectively. In the proposed method, six different classifiers are trained using chest X-ray images, and the five most successful classifiers are used in both phases. In Phase-1 and Phase-2, image features are extracted using the Bag of Features method for Cosine K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Discriminant, Logistic Regression, Bagged Trees Ensemble, Medium Gaussian Support Vector Machine (SVM), excluding SqueezeNet Deep Learning (K\u00a0=\u00a02000 and K\u00a0=\u00a01500 for Phase-1 and Phase-2, respectively). In both phases, the five most successful classifiers are determined, and images classify with the help of the Majority Voting (Mathematical Evaluation) method. The application of the proposed method is designed for users to diagnose COVID-19 Positive, Normal, and Pneumonia. The results show that accuracy values obtained by Majority Voting (Mathematical Evaluation) method for Phase-1 and Phase-2 are equal to 99.86\u00a0% and 99.28\u00a0%, respectively. Thus, it indicates that the accuracy of the whole system is 99.63\u00a0%. When we analyze the classification performance metrics for Phase-1 and Phase-2, Specificity (%), Precision (%), Recall (%), F1 Score (%), Area Under Curve (AUC), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) are equal to 99.98-99.83-99.07-99.51-0.9974-0.9855 and 99.73-99.69-98.63-99.23-0.9928-0.9518, respectively. Moreover, if the classification performance metrics of the whole system are examined, it is seen that Specificity (%), Precision (%), Recall (%), F1 Score (%), AUC, and MCC are 99.88, 99.78, 98.90, 99.40, 0.9956, and 0.9720, respectively. When the studies in the literature are examined, the results show that the proposed model is better than its counterparts. Because the best performance metrics for the dataset used were obtained in this study. In addition, since the biphasic majority voting technique is used in the study, it is seen that the proposed model is more reliable. On the other hand, although there are tens of thousands of studies on this subject, the usability of these models is debatable since most of them do not have graphical user interface applications. Already, in artificial intelligence technologies, besides the performance of the developed models, their usability is also important. Because the developed models can generally be used by people who are less knowledgeable about artificial intelligence.", "Ultrasound for gestational age (GA) assessment is not routinely available in resource-constrained settings, particularly in rural and remote locations. The TraCer device combines a handheld wireless ultrasound probe and a tablet with artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled software that obtains GA from videos of the fetal head by automated measurements of the fetal transcerebellar diameter and head circumference.\nThe aim of this study was to assess the perceptions of pregnant women, their families, and health care workers regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the TraCer device in an appropriate setting.\nA descriptive study using qualitative methods was conducted in two public health facilities in Kilifi county in coastal Kenya prior to introduction of the new technology. Study participants were shown a video role-play of the use of TraCer at a typical antenatal clinic visit. Data were collected through 6 focus group discussions (N=52) and 18 in-depth interviews.\nOverall, TraCer was found to be highly acceptable to women, their families, and health care workers, and its implementation at health care facilities was considered to be feasible. Its introduction was predicted to reduce anxiety regarding fetal well-being, increase antenatal care attendance, increase confidence by women in their care providers, as well as save time and cost by reducing unnecessary referrals. TraCer was felt to increase the self-image of health care workers and reduce time spent providing antenatal care. Some participants expressed hesitancy toward the new technology, indicating the need to test its performance over time before full acceptance by some users. The preferred cadre of health care professionals to use the device were antenatal clinic nurses. Important implementation considerations included adequate staff training and the need to ensure sustainability and consistency of the service. Misconceptions were common, with a tendency to overestimate the diagnostic capability, and expectations that it would provide complete reassurance of fetal and maternal well-being and not primarily the GA.\nThis study shows a positive attitude toward TraCer and highlights the potential role of this innovation that uses AI-enabled automation to assess GA. Clarity of messaging about the tool and its role in pregnancy is essential to address misconceptions and prevent misuse. Further research on clinical validation and related usability and safety evaluations are recommended.", "The development of a multitarget ultrasensitive immunoassay is significant to fields such as medical research, clinical diagnosis, and food safety inspection. In this study, an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted programmable-particle-decoding technique (APT)-based digital immunoassay system was developed to perform multitarget ultrasensitive detection. Multitarget was encoded by programmable polystyrene (PS) microspheres with different characteristics (particle size and number), and subsequent visible signals were recorded under an optical microscope after the immune reaction. The resultant images were further analyzed using a customized, AI-based computer vision technique to decode the intrinsic properties of polystyrene microspheres and to reveal the types and concentrations of targets. Our strategy has successfully detected multiple inflammatory markers in clinical serum and antibiotics with a broad detection range from pg/mL to \u03bcg/mL without extra signal amplification and conversion. An AI-based digital immunoassay system exhibits great potential to be used for the next generation of multitarget detection in disease screening for candidate patients.", "Lynch syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by pathogenic germline variants in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, represents the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome. Lynch syndrome patients are at high risk of CRC despite regular endoscopic surveillance.\nOur aim was to investigate the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy in comparison to High-Definition white-light endoscopy (HD-WLE) for the first time.\nPatients \u226518\u00a0years with LS, with a pathogenic germline variant (MLH1, MHS2, MSH6), and at least one previous colonoscopy (interval 10-36\u00a0months) were eligible. Patients were stratified by previous CRC and affected MMR gene with a 1:1 allocation ratio (AI-assisted vs. HD white-light endoscopy) in this exploratory pilot trial.\nBetween Dec-2021 and Dec-2022, 101 LS patients were randomised and 96 patients were finally analyzed after exclusion of 5 patients due to insufficient bowel preparation. In the HD-WLE arm, adenomas were detected in 12/46 patients compared to 18/50 in the AI arm (26.1% [95% CI 14.3-41.1] vs. 36.0% [22.9-50.8]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.379). The use of AI-assisted colonoscopy especially increased detection of flat adenomas (Paris classification 0-IIb) (examinations with detected flat adenomas: 3/46 [6.5%] vs. 10/50 [20%]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.07; numbers of detected flat adenomas: 4/20 vs. 17/30, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). The median withdrawal time did not differ significantly between HD-WLE and AI (14 vs. 15\u00a0min; p\u00a0=\u00a00.170).\nWe here present first data suggesting that real-time AI-assisted colonoscopy is a promising approach to optimize endoscopic surveillance in LS patients, in particular to improve the detection of flat adenomas.", "Millions of tons of lead were added to gasoline worldwide beginning in 1922, and leaded gasoline has been a major source of population lead exposure. In 1960s, lead began to be removed from automotive gasoline. Removal was completed in 2021.\nTo determine whether removal of lead from automotive gasoline is associated with declines in population mean blood lead levels (BPb).\nWe examined published studies that reported population blood leaded levels for two or more years, and we calculated average concentrations of lead in gasoline corresponding to the years and locations of the blood lead level measurements.\nRemoval of lead from gasoline is associated with declines in BPb in all countries examined. In some countries, BPb continues to fall after lead has been eliminated from gasoline. Following elimination of lead from gasoline, BPb less than 1\u2009\u03bcg/dL have been observed in several European and North American countries, and BPb less than 3\u2009\u03bcg/dL have been documented in several studies from South America.\nThere remain many countries for which no multi-year studies of populations BPb have been identified, including all of Central America, high population countries including Pakistan and Indonesia, and major lead producers including Australia and Russia.\nRemoval of lead from gasoline has been a public health success. Elimination of lead from gasoline has enabled many countries to achieve population mean BPb levels of 1\u2009\u03bcg/dL or lower. These actions have saved lives, increased children's intelligence and created great economic benefit in countries worldwide.", "The research of AI-assisted breast diagnosis has primarily been based on static images. It is unclear whether it represents the best diagnosis image.To explore the method of capturing complementary responsible frames from breast ultrasound screening by using artificial intelligence. We used feature entropy breast network (FEBrNet) to select responsible frames from breast ultrasound screenings and\u00a0compared the diagnostic performance of AI models based on FEBrNet-recommended frames, physician-selected frames, 5-frame interval-selected frames,\u00a0all frames of video, as well as that of ultrasound and mammography specialists. The AUROC of AI model based on FEBrNet-recommended frames outperformed other frame set based AI models, as well as ultrasound and mammography physicians, indicating that FEBrNet can reach level of medical specialists in frame selection.FEBrNet model can extract video responsible frames for breast nodule diagnosis, whose performance is equivalent to the doctors selected responsible frames.", "Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of inflammatory and/or fibrotic conditions with variable outcome and often a dismal prognosis. Since many ILDs are progressive in nature, monitoring of signs and symptoms of progression is essential to inform treatment decisions and patient counseling. Monitoring of ILDs is a multimodality process and includes all aspects of the disease, e.g. measurement of pulmonary function and exercise capacity, symptom registration and quality of life (QoL), imaging, comorbidities and/or involvement of other organs to assess disease activity, symptom burden, treatment effects, adverse events, the need for supportive and palliative care, and lung transplantation.\nFor this narrative review, we searched the PUBMED database to identify articles relevant for monitoring ILDs, including pulmonary function tests, exercise capacity, imaging, telemedicine, symptoms, and QoL.\nDue to the high heterogeneity of the ILDs and their disease course, an individualized multimodality approach must be applied. Future strategies include use of telemedicine for home monitoring of lung function and symptoms, use of artificial intelligence to support automatized guidance of patients, computerized evaluation of ILD changes on imaging, and new imaging tools with less radiation dosage.", "Ischemic stroke (IS) with subsequent cerebrocardiac syndrome (CCS) has a poor prognosis. We aimed to investigate electrocardiogram (ECG) changes after IS with artificial intelligence (AI).\nWe collected ECGs from a healthy population and patients with IS, and then analyzed participant demographics and ECG parameters to identify abnormal features in post-IS ECGs. Next, we trained the convolutional neural network (CNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models to automatically detect the changes in the ECGs; Additionally, We compared the CNN scores of good prognosis (mRS \u2264 2) and poor prognosis (mRS > 2) to assess the prognostic value of CNN model. Finally, we used gradient class activation map (Grad-CAM) to localize the key abnormalities.\nAmong the 3506 ECGs of the IS patients, 2764 ECGs (78.84%) led to an abnormal diagnosis. Then we divided ECGs in the primary cohort into three groups, normal ECGs (N-Ns), abnormal ECGs after the first ischemic stroke (A-ISs), and normal ECGs after the first ischemic stroke (N-ISs). Basic demographic and ECG parameter analyses showed that heart rate, QT interval, and P-R interval were significantly different between 673 N-ISs and 3546 N-Ns (p < 0.05). The CNN has the best performance among the three models in distinguishing A-ISs and N-Ns (AUC: 0.88, 95%CI = 0.86-0.90). The prediction scores of the A-ISs and N-ISs obtained from the all three models are statistically different from the N-Ns (p < 0.001). Futhermore, the CNN scores of the two groups (mRS > 2 and mRS \u2264 2) were significantly different (p < 0.05). Finally, Grad-CAM revealed that the V4 lead may harbor the highest probability of abnormality.\nOur study showed that a high proportion of post-IS ECGs harbored abnormal changes. Our CNN model can systematically assess anomalies in and prognosticate post-IS ECGs.", "Modern and innovative technologies are rapidly penetrating the clinical practices of Orthopaedic Surgeons. The ones that have proved successful for clinical use are Additive Manufacturing/3D printing, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Smart sensors, and Orthobiologics. Industry 5.0 revolution has helped provide personalised treatment by integrating machines and human beings. In this special issue, we present a collection of excellent articles on these technologies.", "In 2018, the \"Ateliers de Giens\" (Giens Workshops) devoted a workshop to artificial intelligence (AI) and led its experts to confirm the potential contribution and theoretical benefit of AI in clinical research, pharmacovigilance, and in improving the efficiency of care. The 2022 workshop is a continuation of this reflection on AI and intelligent automation (IA) by focusing on its contribution to pharmacovigilance and the applications and tasks could be optimized to preserve and strengthen medical and pharmacological expertise in pharmacovigilance. The evolution of pharmacovigilance work is characterized by many tasks with low added value, a growing volume of pharmacovigilance reporting of suspected side effects, and a scarcity of medical staff with expertise in clinical pharmacology and pharmacovigilance and human resources to support this growing need. Together, these parameters contribute to an embolization of the pharmacovigilance system at risk of missing its primary mission: to identify and characterize a risk or even a health alert on a drug. The participants of the workshop (representatives of the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres (CRPV), the French National Agency for Safety of Medicinal Products (ANSM), patients, the pharmaceutical industry, or start-ups working in the development of AI in the field of medicine) shared their experiences, their pilot projects and their expectations on the expected potential, theoretical or proven, AI and IA. This work has made it possible to identify the needs and challenges that AI or IA represent, in the current or future modes of organization of pharmacovigilance activities. This approach led to the development of a SWOT matrix (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats), a basis for reflection to identify critical points and consider four main recommendations: (1) preserve and develop business expertise in pharmacovigilance (including research and development in methods) with the integration of new technologies; (2) improve the quality of pharmacovigilance reports; (3) adapt technical and regulatory means; (4) implement a development strategy for AI and IA tools at the service of expertise.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is ubiquitous and expanding, and the healthcare industry has rapidly adopted AI and machine learning for numerous applications. It is essential to understand that AI is not immune to the biases that impact our clinical and academic work, and in fact may inadvertently amplify rather than reduce them. As we harness the power of AI, it is our obligation to our patients to ensure that we address these concerns. We must take responsibility for proactive stewardship to protect against bias, not only for new AI algorithms, but also for our research studies that may one day provide data for those algorithms.", "Since the isolation of graphene in 2004, two-dimensional (2D) materials research has rapidly evolved into an entire subdiscipline in the physical sciences with a wide range of emergent applications. The unique 2D structure offers an open canvas to tailor and functionalize 2D materials through layer number, defects, morphology, moir\u00e9 pattern, strain, and other control knobs. Through this review, we aim to highlight the most recent discoveries in the following topics: theory-guided synthesis for enhanced control of 2D morphologies, quality, yield, as well as insights toward novel 2D materials; defect engineering to control and understand the role of various defects, including in situ and ex situ methods; and properties and applications that are related to moir\u00e9 engineering, strain engineering, and artificial intelligence. Finally, we also provide our perspective on the challenges and opportunities in this fascinating field.", "There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems to process and interpret electronic health records (EHRs). Natural language processing (NLP) powered by pretrained language models is the key technology for medical AI systems utilizing clinical narratives. However, there are few clinical language models, the largest of which trained in the clinical domain is comparatively small at 110 million parameters (compared with billions of parameters in the general domain). It is not clear how large clinical language models with billions of parameters can help medical AI systems utilize unstructured EHRs. In this study, we develop from scratch a large clinical language model-GatorTron-using >90 billion words of text (including >82 billion words of de-identified clinical text) and systematically evaluate it on five clinical NLP tasks including clinical concept extraction, medical relation extraction, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference (NLI), and medical question answering (MQA). We examine how (1) scaling up the number of parameters and (2) scaling up the size of the training data could benefit these NLP tasks. GatorTron models scale up the clinical language model from 110 million to 8.9 billion parameters and improve five clinical NLP tasks (e.g., 9.6% and 9.5% improvement in accuracy for NLI and MQA), which can be applied to medical AI systems to improve healthcare delivery. The GatorTron models are publicly available at: https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/clara/models/gatortron_og .", "Ever-growing demand for artificial intelligence has motivated research on unconventional computation based on physical devices. While such computation devices mimic brain-inspired analog information processing, the learning procedures still rely on methods optimized for digital processing such as backpropagation, which is not suitable for physical implementation. Here, we present physical deep learning by extending a biologically inspired training algorithm called direct feedback alignment. Unlike the original algorithm, the proposed method is based on random projection with alternative nonlinear activation. Thus, we can train a physical neural network without knowledge about the physical system and its gradient. In addition, we can emulate the computation for this training on scalable physical hardware. We demonstrate the proof-of-concept using an optoelectronic recurrent neural network called deep reservoir computer. We confirmed the potential for accelerated computation with competitive performance on benchmarks. Our results provide practical solutions for the training and acceleration of neuromorphic computation.", "Current methodologies to model connectivity in complex networks either rely on network scientists' intelligence to discover reliable physical rules or use artificial intelligence (AI) that stacks hundreds of inaccurate human-made rules to make a new one that optimally summarizes them together. Here, we provide an accurate and reproducible scientific analysis showing that, contrary to the current belief, stacking more good link prediction rules does not necessarily improve the link prediction performance to nearly optimal as suggested by recent studies. Finally, under the light of our novel results, we discuss the pros and cons of each current state-of-the-art link prediction strategy, concluding that none of the current solutions are what the future might hold for us. Future solutions might require the design and development of next generation \"creative\" AI that are able to generate and understand complex physical rules for us.", "Counterfactual (CF) explanations have been employed as one of the modes of explainability in explainable artificial intelligence (AI)-both to increase the transparency of AI systems and to provide recourse. Cognitive science and psychology have pointed out that people regularly use CFs to express causal relationships. Most AI systems, however, are only able to capture associations or correlations in data, so interpreting them as casual would not be justified. In this perspective, we present two experiments (total n\u00a0= 364) exploring the effects of CF explanations of AI systems' predictions on lay people's causal beliefs about the real world. In Experiment 1, we found that providing CF explanations of an AI system's predictions does indeed (unjustifiably) affect people's causal beliefs regarding factors/features the AI uses and that people are more likely to view them as causal factors in the real world. Inspired by the literature on misinformation and health warning messaging, Experiment 2 tested whether we can correct for the unjustified change in causal beliefs. We found that pointing out that AI systems capture correlations and not necessarily causal relationships can attenuate the effects of CF explanations on people's causal beliefs.", "With a global COVID-19 pandemic, the number of confirmed patients increases rapidly, leaving the world with very few medical resources. Therefore, the fast diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 are one of the world's most critical challenges today. Artificial intelligence-based CT image classification models can quickly and accurately distinguish infected patients from healthy populations. Our research proposes a deep learning model (WE-SAJ) using wavelet entropy for feature extraction, two-layer FNNs for classification and the adaptive Jaya algorithm as a training algorithm. It achieves superior performance compared to the Jaya-based model. The model has a sensitivity of 85.47\u00b11.84, specificity of 87.23\u00b11.67 precision of 87.03\u00b11.34, an accuracy of 86.35\u00b10.70, and F1 score of 86.23\u00b10.77, Matthews correlation coefficient of 72.75\u00b11.38, and Fowlkes-Mallows Index of 86.24\u00b10.76. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis and the effectiveness of the Self-adaptive Jaya algorithm compared to the Jaya algorithm for medical image classification tasks.", "The current narrative review has explored known associations between foot shape, foot posture, and foot conditions during running. The artificial intelligence was found to be a useful metric of foot posture but was less useful in developing and obese individuals. Care should be taken when using the foot posture index to associate pronation with injury risk, and the Achilles tendon and longitudinal arch angles are required to elucidate the risk. The statistical shape modeling (SSM) may derive learnt information from population-based inference and fill in missing data from personalized information. Bone shapes and tissue morphology have been associated with pathology, gender, age, and height and may develop rapid population-specific foot classifiers. Based on this review, future studies are suggested for 1) tracking the internal multi-segmental foot motion and mapping the biplanar 2D motion to 3D shape motion using the SSM; 2) implementing multivariate machine learning or convolutional neural network to address nonlinear correlations in foot mechanics with shape or posture; 3) standardizing wearable data for rapid prediction of instant mechanics, load accumulation, injury risks and adaptation in foot tissue and bones, and correlation with shapes; 4) analyzing dynamic shape and posture via marker-less and real-time techniques under real-life scenarios for precise evaluation of clinical foot conditions and performance-fit footwear development.", "The high detection rate of pulmonary subsolid nodules (SSN) is an increasingly crucial clinical issue due to the increased number of screening tests and the growing popularity of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). The persistence of SSN strongly suggests the possibility of malignancy. Guidelines have been published over the past few years and guide the optimal management of SSNs, but many remain controversial and confusing for clinicians. Therefore, in-depth research on the natural growth history of persistent pulmonary SSN can help provide evidence-based medical recommendations for nodule management. In this review, we briefly describe the differential diagnosis, growth patterns and rates, genetic characteristics, and factors that influence the growth of persistent SSN. With the advancement of radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, individualized evaluation of SSN becomes possible. These technologies together with liquid biopsy, will promote the transformation of current diagnosis and follow-up strategies and provide significant progress in the precise management of subsolid nodules in the early stage of lung cancer.", "The transition toward carbon-neutral electricity is one of the biggest game changers in addressing climate change since it addresses the dual challenges of removing carbon emissions from the two largest sectors of emitters: electricity and transportation. The transition to a carbon-neutral electric grid poses significant challenges to conventional paradigms of modern grid planning and operation. Much of the challenge arises from the scale of the decision-making and the uncertainty associated with the energy supply and demand. Artificial intelligence (AI) could potentially have a transformative impact on accelerating the speed and scale of carbon-neutral transition, as many decision-making processes in the power grid can be cast as classic, though challenging, machine-learning tasks. We point out that to amplify AI's impact on carbon-neutral transition of the electric energy systems, the AI algorithms originally developed for other applications should be tailored in three layers of technology, markets, and policy.", "Recent developments in neuroscience and artificial intelligence have allowed machines to decode mental processes with growing accuracy. Neuroethicists have speculated that perfecting these technologies may result in reactions ranging from an invasion of privacy to an increase in self-understanding. Yet, evaluating these predictions is difficult given that people are poor at forecasting their reactions. To address this, we developed a paradigm using elements of performance magic to emulate future neurotechnologies. We led 59 participants to believe that a (sham) neurotechnological machine could infer their preferences, detect their errors, and reveal their deep-seated attitudes. The machine gave participants randomly assigned positive or negative feedback about their brain's supposed attitudes towards charity. Around 80% of participants in both groups provided rationalisations for this feedback, which shifted their attitudes in the manipulated direction but did not influence donation behaviour. Our paradigm reveals how people may respond to prospective neurotechnologies, which may inform neuroethical frameworks.", "Incrementally learning new information from a non-stationary stream of data, referred to as 'continual learning', is a key feature of natural intelligence, but a challenging problem for deep neural networks. In recent years, numerous deep learning methods for continual learning have been proposed, but comparing their performances is difficult due to the lack of a common framework. To help address this, we describe three fundamental types, or 'scenarios', of continual learning: task-incremental, domain-incremental and class-incremental learning. Each of these scenarios has its own set of challenges. To illustrate this, we provide a comprehensive empirical comparison of currently used continual learning strategies, by performing the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 protocols according to each scenario. We demonstrate substantial differences between the three scenarios in terms of difficulty and in terms of the effectiveness of different strategies. The proposed categorization aims to structure the continual learning field, by forming a key foundation for clearly defining benchmark problems.", "Machine learning based artificial intelligence technology for big data processing has shown great potential in predicting patients' conditions and aiding clinical decisions, and has been widely used in the development of clinical decision support systems in recent years. Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by host response disorder caused by infection, and its early recognition and treatment can significantly improve the prognosis of patients. At present, there are many deficiencies in the clinical application of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), bedside quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA), national early warning score (NEWS), inflammatory indicators, and novel biomarkers for evaluating sepsis. Artificial intelligence has promoted the development of critical care medicine because of its ability to rapidly process and analyze massive data of severe patients. This paper reviews the recent application of artificial intelligence in the early diagnosis and prediction of sepsis, in order to emphasize the importance and limitations of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and prediction of sepsis.", "Digital medicine interventions are currently transforming health care and have created new efficiencies in the delivery process. The business model along with physician payment models are crucial drivers for the adoption of innovations. In the U.S., physician payment is mostly codified in the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT). Until recently, CPT codes related to digital medicine activities were mainly limited to telephone services. To embrace the evolving implementation of the various modalities of digital medicine, the American Medical Association (AMA) determined that a more comprehensive codeset is needed. Thus, the Digital Medicine Payment Advisory Group (DMPAG) was initiated in late 2016. Since then, the DMPAG has achieved a significant and measurable impact on digital medicine intervention adoption by introducing CPT codes for remote physiologic monitoring, remote therapeutic monitoring, artificial intelligence, and other digital innovations.", "Gambling fallacies are a collection of error-stricken beliefs about gambling and how gambling works. Gambling fallacies, while common in the general public, appear to increase as a function of gambling severity. This being the case, many interventions have focused on reducing gambling fallacies as a means of treating problem-gambling. Less research, however, has investigated what factors contributes to gambling fallacy susceptibility in the first place. Available studies have identified associations between gambling fallacy susceptibility and isolated individual differences in, for example, statistical reasoning/understanding, intelligence, or cognitive ability. The current study aimed to assess these cognitive factors in conjunction, and their relative predictive potential for gambling fallacy susceptibility. In an Australian university student sample (n\u2009=\u200990) it was found that there were moderate to strong association between gambling fallacy endorsement and general intelligence, probabilistic reasoning ability, rational cognitive style and the ability to suppress intuitive thought, however, only probabilistic reasoning, rational cognitive style and the ability to suppress intuitive thinking contributed to the prediction of fallacy endorsement. Importantly, each of these factors are malleable. Interventions for the correction of gambling-specific fallacious beliefs should focus on these factors.", "Previous studies have frequently reported neurocognitive deficits in children born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) at school age, which may contribute to academic difficulties. Yet, age at onset of these deficits is currently unknown. We evaluated neurocognitive skills with possible determinants in preschool children born with CDH. Eligible 5-year-old children born with CDH (2010-2015) who participated in our prospective structural follow-up program were included. We used the WPPSI-III to assess intelligence, subtests of the Kaufman-ABC for memory, and NEPSY-II to assess inhibition and attention. We included 63 children. Their test scores generally were within or significantly above normal range: total IQ\u2009=\u2009103.4 (15.7) (p\u2009=\u20090.13); Verbal memory\u2009=\u200910.2 (2.8) (p\u2009=\u20090.61); Visuospatial memory\u2009=\u200911.4 (2.6) (p\u2009<\u20090.01); Inhibition\u2009=\u200910.5 (2.2), (p\u2009=\u20090.10). In univariable analyses, length of ICU-stay was negatively associated with IQ, and maximum vasoactive inotropic score and open repair were negatively associated with inhibition skills. In multivariable regression analysis, the latter association remained (B\u2009=\u20095.52, p\u2009=\u20090.04 (CI 0.32-10.72)).\u00a0 \u00a0Conclusions: In these tested 5-year-old children born with CDH, neuropsychological outcome was normal on average. While problems in 8-year-olds are common, we did not detect onset of these problems at age 5. Yet, we cannot rule out that this cohort had a relatively mild level of disease severity; therefore, conclusions should be interpreted with caution. However, given the growing-into-deficit hypothesis, meaning that deviant brain development in early life is revealed once higher cognitive brain functions are demanded, follow-up should be conducted up to school age, and preferably beyond. What is Known: \u2022\u00a0Children born with CDH are at risk for academic difficulties at school age. \u2022 Whether these difficulties can be detected already before school age is unknown. What is New: \u2022\u00a0At age 5 years, intelligence, inhibition, attention, and memory skills were all within normal range, or even above, in children with CDH. This is supportive of the growing-into-deficit hypothesis in this patient population. \u2022\u00a0Those who underwent open surgical correction had poorer inhibition skills than those who were corrected with minimal access surgery.", "Achieving an efficient and reliable method is essential to interpret a user's brain wave and deliver an accurate response in biomedical signal processing. However, EEG patterns exhibit high variability across time and uncertainty due to noise and it is a significant problem to be addressed in mental task as motor imagery. Therefore, fuzzy components may help to enable a higher tolerance to noisy conditions. With the advent of Deep Learning and its considerable contributions to Artificial intelligence and data analysis, numerous efforts have been made to evaluate and analyze brain signals. In this study, to make use of neural activity phenomena, the feature extraction preprocessing is applied based on Multi-scale filter bank CSP. In the following, the hybrid series architecture named EEG-CLFCNet is proposed which extract the frequency and spatial features by Compact-CNN and the temporal features by the LSTM network. However, the classification results are evaluated by merging the fully connected network and fuzzy neural block. Here, the proposed method is further validated by the BCI competition IV-2a dataset and compare with two hyperparameter tuning methods, Coordinate-descent and Bayesian optimization algorithm. The proposed architecture that used fuzzy neural block and Bayesian optimization as tuning approach, results in better classification accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art literatures. As results shown, the remarkable performance of the proposed model, EEG-CLFCNet, and the general integration of fuzzy units to other classifiers would pave the way for enhanced MI-based BCI systems.", "Fluid assessment is challenging, and fluid overload poses a significant problem among dialysis patients, with pulmonary oedema being the most serious consequence. Our study aims to develop a simple objective fluid assessment strategy using lung ultrasound (LUS) and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess the fluid status of dialysis patients.\nThis was a single-centre study of 76 hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients carried out between July 2020 to May 2022. The fluid status of dialysis patients was assessed via a simplified 8-point LUS method using a portable handheld ultrasound device (HHUSD), clinical examination and bioimpedance analysis (BIA). The primary outcome was the performance of 8-point LUS using a portable HHUSD in diagnosing fluid overload compared to physical examination and BIA. The secondary outcome was to develop and validate a novel AI software program to quantify B-line count and assess the fluid status of dialysis patients.\nOur study showed a moderate correlation between LUS B-line count and fluid overload assessed by clinical examination (r\u2009=\u20090.475, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and BIA (r\u2009=\u20090.356. p\u2009<\u20090.001). The use of AI to detect B-lines on LUS in our study for dialysis patients was shown to have good agreement with LUS B lines observed by physicians; (r\u2009=\u20090.825, p\u2009<\u20090.001) for the training dataset and (r\u2009=\u20090.844, p\u2009<\u20090.001) for the validation dataset.\nOur study confirms that 8-point LUS using HHUSD, with AI-based detection of B lines, can provide clinically useful information on the assessment of hydration status and diagnosis of fluid overload for dialysis patients in a user-friendly and time-efficient way.", "To investigate neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes at primary school age in relation to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children with Robin sequence (RS) treated with the Tuebingen palatal plate in infancy and to assess the impact of OSA in these patients.\nForty-two primary school-aged children (n = 21 with RS, n = 21 age- and sex-matched controls) underwent polysomnography, intelligence testing (\"Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition\" [WISC-V]), and anthropometrics. Families completed a 7-day sleep diary and questionnaires on sleep and behavior (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire [CSHQ] and the Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]).\nIn children with RS (17 non-syndromic, four syndromic; median age 9.7 [8.5-10.8] years), the obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) was significantly higher than in controls (1.3 [0.4-2.7]/h vs. 0.4 [0.1-0.6]/h). Two syndromic children with RS were already on nocturnal respiratory support for OSA prior to our study, and one non-syndromic child was diagnosed with severe OSA (OAHI 57/h) despite an unremarkable medical history and questionnaire. The overall intelligence quotient in children with RS was within the normal range and did not differ between children with RS and healthy peers (102 vs. 108, p = .05). However, children with RS had values in the at-risk clinical range for externalizing behavior.\nThese children with RS showed an increased risk of OSA and behavioral problems, suggesting regular screening for OSA throughout childhood. Neurocognitive scores in children with RS were within the normal range after adequate treatment of OSA during infancy.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to augment clinicians' diagnostic and decision-making capabilities. It is well suited to identify patterns and correlations within data sets and may be applied to identify elements of importance in complex and data-laden areas such as patient selection, diagnostics, treatment, and outcome prediction. The development of modern neurosurgery has been dependent on major technological advances. In line with this, a growing interest is seen in the use of AI to assist in neurosurgical research and enhance neurosurgical practices.\nA bibliometric analysis of the 50 most-cited articles alluding to the use of AI in neurosurgery, from inception until July of 2022, was undertaken using the Web of Science database. Statistical analyses were performed on R.\nThe citation count ranged from 29 to 159 (mean: 51.9, standard deviation: 24.8), and the top-cited article was a 2018 systematic review published in World Neurosurgery. Most articles were published after 2015 (85%). The United States was the largest contributing country on the list with 22 articles. Four first and last authors, each, had 2 or more publications. Female first and last authorship was attributed to 18% and 0% of the articles, respectively.\nThis review highlights the most-impactful articles pertaining to AI in the field of neurosurgery. Although female authors were significantly underrepresented on the list, their work was at least as impactful as their male peers. Finally, the striking dominance of articles originating from the developed world raises concerns as to the future of AI in attending to the global health crisis.", "Bioactive ingredients from natural products have always been an important resource for the discovery of drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Senile plaques, which are formed with amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides and excess metal ions, are found in AD brains and have been suggested to play an important role in AD pathogenesis. Here, we attempted to design an effective and smart screening method based on cheminformatics approaches to find new ingredients against AD from Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) and verified the bioactivity of expected ingredients through experiments. This method integrated advanced artificial intelligence models and target prediction methods to realize the stepwise analysis and filtering of all ingredients. Finally, we obtained the expected new compound malvidin-3-O-galactoside (Ma-3-gal-Cl). The in vitro experiments showed that Ma-3-gal-Cl could reduce the OH\u00b7 generation and intracellular ROS from the A\u03b2/Cu2+/AA mixture and maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential of SH-SY5Y cells. Molecular docking and Western blot results indicated that Ma-3-gal-Cl could reduce the amount of activated caspase-3 via binding with unactivated caspase-3 and reduce the expression of phosphorylated p38 via binding with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases-6 (MKK6). Moreover, Ma-3-gal-Cl could inhibit the A\u03b2 aggregation via binding with A\u03b2 monomer and fibers. Thus, Ma-3-gal-Cl showed significant effects on protecting SH-SY5Y cells from A\u03b2/Cu2+/AA induced damage via antioxidation effect and inhibition effect to the A\u03b2 aggregation.", "Coronary artery calcification (CAC), often assessed by computed tomography (CT), is a powerful marker of coronary artery disease that can guide preventive therapies. Computed tomographies, however, are not always accessible or serially obtainable. It remains unclear whether other widespread tests such as transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) can be used to predict CAC.\nUsing a data set of 2,881 TTE videos paired with coronary calcium CTs, we trained a video-based artificial intelligence convolutional neural network to predict CAC scores from parasternal long-axis views. We evaluated the model's ability to classify patients from a held-out sample as well as an external site sample into zero CAC and high CAC (CAC \u2265 400 Agatston units) groups by receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves. We also investigated whether such classifications prognosticated significant differences in 1-year mortality rates by the log-rank test of Kaplan-Meier curves.\nTransthoracic echocardiogram artificial intelligence models had high discriminatory abilities in predicting zero CAC (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [AUC]\u00a0=\u00a00.81 [95% CI, 0.74-0.88], F1 score\u00a0=\u00a00.95) and high CAC (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.74 [0.68-0.8], F1 score\u00a0=\u00a00.74). This performance was confirmed in an external test data set of 92 TTEs (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.75 [0.65-0.85], F1 score\u00a0=\u00a00.77; and AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.85 [0.76-0.93], F1 score\u00a0=\u00a00.59, respectively). Risk stratification by TTE-predicted CAC performed similarly to CT CAC scores in prognosticating significant differences in 1-year survival in high-CAC patients (CT CAC \u2265\u00a0400 vs CT CAC < 400, P\u00a0=\u00a0.03; TTE-predicted CAC \u2265 400 vs TTE-predicted CAC < 400, P\u00a0=\u00a0.02).\nA video-based deep learning model successfully used TTE videos to predict zero CAC and high CAC with high accuracy. Transthoracic echocardiography-predicted CAC prognosticated differences in 1-year survival similar to CT CAC. Deep learning of TTEs holds promise for future adjunctive coronary artery disease risk stratification to guide preventive therapies.", "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have received increasing attention because of their expressive power on topological data, but they are still criticized for their lack of interpretability. To interpret GNN models, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been developed. However, these methods are limited to qualitative analyses without quantitative assessments from the real-world datasets due to a lack of ground truths. In this study, we have established five XAI-specific molecular property benchmarks, including two synthetic and three experimental datasets. Through the datasets, we quantitatively assessed six XAI methods on four GNN models and made comparisons with seven medicinal chemists of different experience levels. The results demonstrated that XAI methods could deliver reliable and informative answers for medicinal chemists in identifying the key substructures. Moreover, the identified substructures were shown to complement existing classical fingerprints to improve molecular property predictions, and the improvements increased with the growth of training data.", "Flexible sensing devices (FSDs) fabricated using conductive hydrogels have attracted researchers' extensive enthusiasm in recent years due to their versatility. Considering the complexity of their application environments, the integration of various functional characteristics (e.g., excellent mechanical, antibacterial, and antifreezing properties) is an important guarantee for FSDs to stably perform their applications in different environments. Herein, we developed a multifunctional conductive polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) organohydrogel PVA-CT-Ag-Al-Gly (PCAAG) by using a green, natural, and cheap biomass, chestnut tannin (CT), as a crosslinking agent, nano-silver particles (AgNPs) as an antimicrobial agent, aluminum trichloride (AlCl3) as a conducting medium, and the mixed water-glycerol as the solvent system. In this organohydrogel system, CT acted not only as the reducing and stabilizing agent for the preparation of antibacterial AgNPs but also as the crosslinking agent owing to its strong multiple hydrogen bonding interactions with PVA, realizing its multifunctional application. The PCAAG organohydrogel possessed outstanding physical and mechanical properties (350.54% of the maximum fracture strain and 1.55 MPa of the maximum tensile strength), considerable bacteriostatic effects against both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and excellent freeze resistance (it could function normally at -20 \u00b0C). The motion-monitoring sensor based on the PCAAG organohydrogel exhibited excellent specificity recognition for both large-amplitude (e.g., elbow bending, wrist bending, finger bending, running and walking, etc.) and small-amplitude (frowning and swallowing) human movements. The flexible keyboard constructed by using the PCAAG organohydrogel could easily achieve the transformation between digital signals and electrical signals, and the signal output had both specificity and stability. The velocity-monitoring sensor fabricated by using the PCAAG organohydrogel could accurately measure the speed of the object movement (less than 3% of relative error). In short, the present PCAAG organohydrogel solves the problems of the single application environment and a few application scenarios of traditional conductive hydrogels and possesses remarkable application potential as a multifunctional FSD in many fields such as artificial intelligence, sport management, soft robots, and human-computer interface.", "Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and specifically in deep learning (DL) techniques, have enabled broad application of these methods in health care. The promise of the DL approach has spurred further interest in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) development and applications using both \"traditional\" machine learning methods and newer DL-based methods. We use the term CAD-AI to refer to this expanded clinical decision support environment that uses traditional and DL-based AI methods. Numerous studies have been published to date on the development of machine learning tools for computer-aided, or AI-assisted, clinical tasks. However, most of these machine learning models are not ready for clinical deployment. It is of paramount importance to ensure that a clinical decision support tool undergoes proper training and rigorous validation of its generalizability and robustness before adoption for patient care in the clinic. To address these important issues, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Computer-Aided Image Analysis Subcommittee (CADSC) is charged, in part, to develop recommendations on practices and standards for the development and performance assessment of computer-aided decision support systems. The committee has previously published two opinion papers on the evaluation of CAD systems and issues associated with user training and quality assurance of these systems in the clinic. With machine learning techniques continuing to evolve and CAD applications expanding to new stages of the patient care process, the current task group report considers the broader issues common to the development of most, if not all, CAD-AI applications and their translation from the bench to the clinic. The goal is to bring attention to the proper training and validation of machine learning algorithms that may improve their generalizability and reliability and accelerate the adoption of CAD-AI systems for clinical decision support.", "The healthcare burden of cardiovascular diseases remains a major issue worldwide. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and improving identification of people with a higher risk profile of systemic vascular disease through noninvasive examinations is crucial. In ophthalmology, retinal vascular network imaging is simple and noninvasive and can provide in vivo information of the microstructure and vascular health. For more than 10\u00a0years, different research teams have been working on developing software to enable automatic analysis of the retinal vascular network from different imaging techniques (retinal fundus photographs, OCT angiography, adaptive optics, etc.) and to provide a description of the geometric characteristics of its arterial and venous components. Thus, the structure of retinal vessels could be considered a witness of the systemic vascular status. A new approach called \"oculomics\" using retinal image datasets and artificial intelligence algorithms recently increased the interest in retinal microvascular biomarkers. Despite the large volume of associated research, the role of retinal biomarkers in the screening, monitoring, or prediction of systemic vascular disease remains uncertain. A PubMed search was conducted until August 2022 and yielded relevant peer-reviewed articles based on a set of inclusion criteria. This literature review is intended to summarize the state of the art in oculomics and cardiovascular disease research.", "Background: Although immune microenvironment-related chemokines, extracellular matrix (ECM), and intrahepatic immune cells are reported to be highly involved in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related diseases, their roles in diagnosis, prognosis, and drug sensitivity evaluation remain unclear. Here, we aimed to study their clinical use to provide a basis for precision medicine in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the amalgamation of artificial intelligence. Methods: High-throughput liver transcriptomes from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), NODE (https://www.bio.sino.org/node), the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and our in-house hepatocellular carcinoma patients were collected in this study. Core immunosignals that participated in the entire diseases course of hepatitis B were explored using the \"Gene set variation analysis\" R package. Using ROC curve analysis, the impact of core immunosignals and amino acid utilization related gene on hepatocellular carcinoma patient's clinical outcome were calculated. The utility of core immunosignals as a classifier for hepatocellular carcinoma tumor tissue was evaluated using explainable machine-learning methods. A novel deep residual neural network model based on immunosignals was constructed for the long-term overall survival (LS) analysis. In vivo drug sensitivity was calculated by the \"oncoPredict\" R package. Results: We identified nine genes comprising chemokines and ECM related to hepatitis B virus-induced inflammation and fibrosis as CLST signals. Moreover, CLST was co-enriched with activated CD4+ T cells bearing harmful factors (aCD4) during all stages of hepatitis B virus pathogenesis, which was also verified by our hepatocellular carcinoma data. Unexpectedly, we found that hepatitis B virus-hepatocellular carcinoma patients in the CLSThighaCD4high subgroup had the shortest overall survival (OS) and were characterized by a risk gene signature associated with amino acids utilization. Importantly, characteristic genes specific to CLST/aCD4 showed promising clinical relevance in identifying patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma via explainable machine learning. In addition, the 5-year long-term overall survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients can be effectively classified by CLST/aCD4 based GeneSet-ResNet model. Subgroups defined by CLST and aCD4 were significantly involved in the sensitivity of hepatitis B virus-hepatocellular carcinoma patients to chemotherapy treatments. Conclusion: CLST and aCD4 are hepatitis B virus pathogenesis-relevant immunosignals that are highly involved in hepatitis B virus-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Gene set variation analysis derived immunogenomic signatures enabled efficient diagnostic and prognostic model construction. The clinical application of CLST and aCD4 as indicators would be beneficial for the precision management of hepatocellular carcinoma.", "Anthropomorphic phantoms are used in surgical planning and intervention. Ideal accuracy and high efficiency are prerequisites for its clinical application. We aimed to develop a fully automated artificial intelligence-based three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction system (AI system) to assist thoracic surgery and to determine its accuracy, efficiency, and safety for clinical use.\nThis AI system was developed based on a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and optimized by gradient descent after training with 500 cases, achieving a Dice coefficient of 89.2%. Accuracy was verified by comparing virtual structures predicted by the AI system with anatomical structures of patients in retrospective (n\u00a0=\u00a0113) and prospective cohorts (n\u00a0=\u00a0139) who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy at the Peking University Cancer Hospital. Operation time and blood loss were compared between the retrospective cohort (without AI assistance) and prospective cohort (with AI assistance) for safety evaluation. The time consumption for reconstruction and the quality score were compared between the AI system and manual reconstruction software (Mimics\u00ae) for efficiency validation. This study was registered at https://www.chictr.org.cn as ChiCTR2100050985.\nThe AI system reconstructed 13,608 pulmonary segmental branches from retrospective and prospective cohorts, and 1573 branches of interest corresponding to phantoms were detectable during the operation for verification, achieving 100% and 97% accuracy for segmental bronchi, 97.2% and 99.1% for segmental arteries, and 93.2% and 98.8% for segmental veins, respectively. With the assistance of the AI system, the operation time was shortened by 24.5\u00a0min for lobectomy (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and 20\u00a0min for segmentectomy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Compared to Mimics\u00ae, the AI system reduced the model reconstruction time by 14.2\u00a0min (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and it also outperformed Mimics\u00ae in model quality scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nThe AI system can accurately predict thoracic anatomical structures with higher efficiency than manual reconstruction software. Constant optimization and larger population validation are required.\nThis study was funded by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. L222020) and other sources.", "Assuming that potential biases of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems can be identified and controlled for (e.g., by providing high quality training data), employing such systems to augment human resource (HR)-decision makers in candidate selection provides an opportunity to make selection processes more objective. However, as the final hiring decision is likely to remain with humans, prevalent human biases could still cause discrimination. This work investigates the impact of an AI-based system's candidate recommendations on humans' hiring decisions and how this relation could be moderated by an Explainable AI (XAI) approach. We used a self-developed platform and conducted an online experiment with 194 participants. Our quantitative and qualitative findings suggest that the recommendations of an AI-based system can reduce discrimination against older and female candidates but appear to cause fewer selections of foreign-race candidates. Contrary to our expectations, the same XAI approach moderated these effects differently depending on the context.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12525-022-00600-9.", "Fungal hydroxylation of steroids is a key step in the industrial production of various steroid drugs. The main enzymes that enable these reactions are Cytochrome P450s (CYP), though very few industrially important CYPs have been identified and characterized. In this study, we identified a CYP enzyme (CYP-N2) and a cytochrome P450 reductase (CPRns) from Nigrospora sphaerica 722 by a combination of transcriptome sequencing and heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. Gene CYP-N2 co-expressed with CPRns in Pichia pastoris GS115 showed 6\u03b2- and 15\u03b1-hydroxylation activities on progesterone. Different hydroxylation specificity of CYP-N2 was observed on different steroid substrates. CYP-N2 showed 1\u03b1-hydroxylation on cortisone and 1\u03b1-hydroxylation and 6\u03b2-hydroxylation activities on androstenedione (AD). With dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as a substrate, the hydroxylated products of CYP-N2 included 7\u03b1-hydroxy-DHEA and 7\u03b1,15\u03b1-dihydroxy-DHEA. In order to precisely elucidate CYP-N2 biological function and find out the key\u00a0amino\u00a0acids influencing its hydroxylation capabilities in the binding pocket, new generation artificial intelligence technology AlphaFold 2 was used to predict the function-structure of CYP-N2 with high reliability. Through molecular docking, it was concluded that the residues almost binding all substrates were located in the same substrate binding pocket and the various hydroxylation abilities might be due to the different binding conformations of different substrates in the binding pocket. Alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to verify key amino acids identified by the molecular docking with steroid substrates. The 128 THR mutation resulted in conversion rate increase for substrates AD and cortisone by 2.6-fold and 2.1-fold respectively. The information obtained in this study is beneficial to facilitating the engineering of more efficient steroid hydroxylases for industrial applications.", "With the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence, various platforms were developed to aid in the time-consuming process of article screening in systematic reviews. We aim to analyze the efficiency of a machine learning-assisted platform as an end-user to aid in the screening of the articles for selection into systematic review in orthopaedic surgery.\nWe included three previously published systematic reviews in the field of orthopaedics of increasing levels of difficulty in the structure of the research question to assess the efficiency of a platform with active-learning technology for article screening. We compared the efficiency of the platform compared to the traditional screening and also across the various scenarios tested. We performed five iterations for each review analyzed. The outcome parameters analyzed were the work saved at 95% recall (WSS-95), work saved at 100% recall (WSS-100), and relevant records found after screening the first 30% of the total records (RRF-30).\nThe machine learning-assisted screening significantly improved the rate of identifying the relevant records compared to the traditional screening method (p<0.001). The WSS-95 for the easy, intermediate, and advanced screening scenarios were 78%, 59%, and 38%, respectively. The WSS-100 for the easy, intermediate, and advanced screening scenarios were 75%, 48%, and 7%, respectively. The RRF-30 for the easy, intermediate, and advanced screening scenarios were 97%, 86%, and 64%, respectively. We noted a significant reduction (p<0.001) in the efficiency with the increasing level of difficulty of the screening scenarios.\nThe machine learning platform is significantly better than the traditional method as an assistive technology to aid in article screening. However, the efficiency of the platform significantly decreases as the complexity of the research question increases.", "Speech disorder is a significant problem for people affected with Parkinson's disease (PD) leading to a substantial disability to communicate with others. PD affects the voice, including changes in pitch, intensity, articulation, and syllable rate.We aimed to study the current status of artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning algorithms (MLAs) in the assessment of speech abnormalities in PD along with the generation of intelligible synthetic speech for voice rehabilitation. We searched the literature for studies focusing on speech/voice disorder in PD and rehabilitation techniques till June 18, 2022. We searched PubMed and Engineering Village (Compendex and Inspec combined) databases. After careful screening of the title and evaluation of abstracts, we used select articles describing the use of AI or its various forms in the management of speech abnormalities in PD to synthesize this review. MLAs classify PD and non-PD patients with an accuracy of more than 90% using only voice features. Non-acoustic sensors can rehabilitate PD patient by converting dysarthric speech to highly intelligible speech using MLAs. MLAs can automatically assess several speech features and quantify the progression of speech abnormalities in PD. PD speech rehabilitation using MLAs may prove superior to other available therapies.", "Intelligent video surveillance based on artificial intelligence, image processing, and other advanced technologies is a hot topic of research in the upcoming era of Industry 5.0. Currently, low recognition accuracy and low location precision of devices in intelligent monitoring remain a problem in production lines. This paper proposes a production line device recognition and localization method based on an improved YOLOv5s model. The proposed method can achieve real-time detection and localization of production line equipment such as robotic arms and AGV carts by introducing CA attention module in YOLOv5s network model architecture, GSConv lightweight convolution method and Slim-Neck method in Neck layer, add Decoupled Head structure to the Detect layer. The experimental results show that the improved method achieves 93.6% Precision, 85.6% recall, and 91.8% mAP@0.5, and the Pascal VOC2007 public dataset test shows that the improved method effectively improves the recognition accuracy. The research results can substantially improve the intelligence level of production lines and provide an important reference for manufacturing industries to realize intelligent and digital transformation.", "The use of digital image analysis and count regression models contributes to the reproducibility and rigor of histological studies in cardiovascular research. The use of formalized computer-based quantification strategies of histological images essentially removes potential researcher bias, allows for higher analysis throughput, and enables easy sharing of formalized quantification tools, contributing to research transparency, and data transferability. Moreover, the use of count regression models rather than ratios in statistical analysis of cell population data incorporates the extent of sampling into analysis and acknowledges the non-Gaussian nature of count distributions. Using quantification of proliferating cardiomyocytes in embryonic murine hearts as an example, we describe how these improvements can be implemented using open-source artificial intelligence-based image analysis tools and novel count regression models to efficiently analyze real-life data.", "Underlying medical conditions, such as cancer, kidney disease and heart failure, are associated with a higher risk for severe COVID-19. Accurate classification of COVID-19 patients with underlying medical conditions is critical for personalized treatment decision and prognosis estimation. In this study, we propose an interpretable artificial intelligence model termed VDJMiner to mine the underlying medical conditions and predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients according to their immune repertoires. In a cohort of more than 1400 COVID-19 patients, VDJMiner accurately identifies multiple underlying medical conditions, including cancers, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.961. Meanwhile, in this same cohort, VDJMiner achieves an AUC of 0.922 in predicting severe COVID-19. Moreover, VDJMiner achieves an accuracy of 0.857 in predicting the response of COVID-19 patients to tocilizumab treatment on the leave-one-out test. Additionally, VDJMiner interpretively mines and scores V(D)J gene segments of the T-cell receptors that are associated with the disease. The identified associations between single-cell V(D)J gene segments and COVID-19 are highly consistent with previous studies. The source code of VDJMiner is publicly accessible at https://github.com/TencentAILabHealthcare/VDJMiner.

Evidently, it is important to examine the various psychological processes which may assist in a better understanding, therefore addressing the high prevalence of online impulse buying. This study builds upon self-regulation theory to explore how mindfulness influences online impulse buying, and examines problematic internet use as a mediator in the relationship between mindfulness and online impulse buying. Further, this study investigates how emotional intelligence as a moderator plays the role of a suppressant on the adverse impact of problematic Internet use which fuels online impulse buying.\nA total of 598 individuals working with various servicebased industries responded to the questionnaire. Multiple regression and moderated mediation analysis was used using SPSS and AMOS for analyzing the data.\nProblematic internet use mediates the relationship between mindfulness and online impulse buying behavior. Emotional intelligence negatively moderates the relationship between problematic internet use and online impulse buying behavior.\nThis study findings outlined the inverse relationship of mindfulness & online impulse buying, along with the mediating effect of problematic internet use between mindfulness and online impulse buying. Further, this study showed how emotional intelligence played an important role as a moderator by suppressing the adverse impact of problematic Internet use and preventing online impulse buying. The study offers implications to online marketers in regulating the unplanned purchase process-while minimizing uninhibited buying behavior that leads to regret, and the subsequent intention to return products. Further, social and theoretical implications are discussed.", "To design and evaluate a deep learning model based on ultra-widefield images (UWFIs) that can detect several common fundus diseases.\nBased on 4574 UWFIs, a deep learning model was trained and validated that can identify normal fundus and eight common fundus diseases, namely referable diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, pathologic myopia, retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, vitreous opacity, and optic neuropathy. The model was tested on three test sets with data volumes of 465, 979, and 525. The performance of the three deep learning networks, EfficientNet-B7, DenseNet, and ResNet-101, was evaluated on the internal test set. Additionally, we compared the performance of the deep learning model with that of doctors in a tertiary referral hospital.\nCompared to the other two deep learning models, EfficientNet-B7 achieved the best performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the EfficientNet-B7 model on the internal test set, external test set\u00a0A and external test set\u00a0B were 0.9708 (0.8772, 0.9849) to 1.0000 (1.0000, 1.0000), 0.9683 (0.8829, 0.9770) to 1.0000 (0.9975, 1.0000), and 0.8919 (0.7150, 0.9055) to 0.9977 (0.9165, 1.0000), respectively. On a data\u00a0set of 100 images, the total accuracy of the deep learning model was 93.00%, the average accuracy of three ophthalmologists who had been working for 2\u00a0years and three ophthalmologists who had been working in fundus imaging for more than 5\u00a0years was 88.00% and 94.00%, respectively.\nHigh performance was achieved on all three test sets using our UWFI multidisease classification model with a small sample size and fast model inference. The performance of the artificial intelligence model was comparable to that of a physician with 2-5\u00a0years of experience in fundus diseases at a tertiary referral hospital. The model is expected to be used as an effective aid for fundus disease screening.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) for human emotion estimation, such as facial emotion estimation, has been actively studied. On the other hand, there has been little research on unconscious phenomena in cognition and psychology (i.e., cognitive biases) caused by viewing AI emotion estimation information. Therefore, this study verifies RQ \"Do people have a cognitive bias in which impressions of others (i.e., how to see and feel about others) are changed by viewing biased AI's emotion estimation information? If it exists, can impression manipulation methods that intentionally use this cognitive bias be realized?\" The proposed method for verification makes the emotion estimation system biased so as to estimate emotion more positively/negatively than AI without bias. A prototype system was implemented. Evaluation using video showed that the presentation of biased emotion estimation information causes a phenomenon that quickly and unconsciously changes the way people see and feel others' impressions, which supported the RQ. Specifically, viewing information that estimated others' emotions more positively/negatively caused the phenomenon in which the user's self-judgment was overridden and others' impressions of emotions, words, and actions were perceived more positively/negatively. The existence of this phenomenon and method indicates that biased emotion estimation AI has the potential to both cause adverse effects on people and support people for good purposes through the manipulation of their impressions. This study provides helpful insights for the design and use of emotion estimation AI considering cognitive biases.", "Although the literature reports that play provides substantial psychological benefits for individuals, it is often only emphasized by educators for younger children but less so for emerging adults. This cross-sectional study examined the impact of time spent engaged in play on emerging adults' emotional intelligence, emotional traits, and resilience.\nParticipants (N\u2006=\u2006131, 93.9% women) were full-time undergraduate students between the ages of 19 and 25 (M\u2006=\u200621.28, SD\u2006=\u20061.08).\nResults showed that play experiences cultivated emotional intelligence and strengthened resilience. Further, the findings supported a serial mediation model in which play was indirectly related to resilience through its effect on emotional intelligence and positive emotion.\nPlay is recognized as a means to relieve stress and protect psychological wellbeing. Emerging adults who experience pleasure, enjoyment, learning, and the acquisition of new skills will benefit from play. Individuals should enhance positive play experiences, particularly sporting activities, to maintain a healthy work-life balance given the positive relationship between play, emotional intelligence, emotional traits, and resilience.", "Web-based resources and social media platforms play an increasingly important role in health-related knowledge and experience sharing. There is a growing interest in the use of these novel data sources for epidemiological surveillance of substance use behaviors and trends.\nThe key aims were to describe the development and application of the drug abuse ontology (DAO) as a framework for analyzing web-based and social media data to inform public health and substance use research in the following areas: determining user knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to nonmedical use of buprenorphine and illicitly manufactured opioids through the analysis of web forum data Prescription Drug Abuse Online Surveillance; analyzing patterns and trends of cannabis product use in the context of evolving cannabis legalization policies in the United States through analysis of Twitter and web forum data (eDrugTrends); assessing trends in the availability of novel synthetic opioids through the analysis of cryptomarket data (eDarkTrends); and analyzing COVID-19 pandemic trends in social media data related to 13 states in the United States as per Mental Health America reports.\nThe domain and scope of the DAO were defined using competency questions from popular ontology methodology (101 ontology development). The 101 method includes determining the domain and scope of ontology, reusing existing knowledge, enumerating important terms in ontology, defining the classes, their properties and creating instances of the classes. The quality of the ontology was evaluated using a set of tools and best practices recognized by the semantic web community and the artificial intelligence community that engage in natural language processing.\nThe current version of the DAO comprises 315 classes, 31 relationships, and 814 instances among the classes. The ontology is flexible and can easily accommodate new concepts. The integration of the ontology with machine learning algorithms dramatically decreased the false alarm rate by adding external knowledge to the machine learning process. The ontology is recurrently updated to capture evolving concepts in different contexts and applied to analyze data related to social media and dark web marketplaces.\nThe DAO provides a powerful framework and a useful resource that can be expanded and adapted to a wide range of substance use and mental health domains to help advance big data analytics of web-based data for substance use epidemiology research.", "Forensic odontology may require a visual or clinical method during identification. Sometimes it may require forensic experts to refer to the existing technique to identify individuals, for example, by using the atlas to estimate the dental age. However, the existing technology can be a complicated procedure for a large-scale incident requiring a more significant number of forensic identifications, particularly during mass disasters. This has driven many experts to perform automation in their current practice to improve efficiency.\nThis article aims to evaluate current artificial intelligence applications and discuss their performance concerning the algorithm architecture used in forensic odontology.\nThis study summarizes the findings of 28 research papers published between 2010 and June 2022 using the Arksey and O'Malley framework, updated by the Joanna Briggs Institute Framework for Scoping Reviews methodology, highlighting the research trend of artificial intelligence technology in forensic odontology. In addition, a literature search was conducted on Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed, and the results were evaluated based on their content and significance.\nThe potential application of artificial intelligence technology in forensic odontology can be categorized into four: (1) human bite marks, (2) sex determination, (3) age estimation, and (4) dental comparison. This powerful tool can solve humanity's problems by giving an adequate number of datasets, the appropriate implementation of algorithm architecture, and the proper assignment of hyperparameters that enable the model to perform the prediction at a very high level of performance.\nThe reviewed articles demonstrate that machine learning techniques are reliable for studies involving continuous features such as morphometric parameters. However, machine learning models do not strictly require large training datasets to produce promising results. In contrast, deep learning enables the processing of unstructured data, such as medical images, which require large volumes of data. Occasionally, transfer learning was used to overcome the limitation of data. In the meantime, this method's capacity to automatically learn task-specific feature representations has made it a significant success in forensic odontology.", "Radar is widely employed in many applications, especially in autonomous driving. At present, radars are only designed as simple data collectors, and they are unable to meet new requirements for real-time and intelligent information processing as environmental complexity increases. It is inevitable that smart radar systems will need to be developed to deal with these challenges and digital twins in cyber-physical systems (CPS) have proven to be effective tools in many aspects. However, human involvement is closely related to radar technology and plays an important role in the operation and management of radars; thus, digital twins' radars in CPS are insufficient to realize smart radar systems due to the inadequate consideration of human factors. ACP-based parallel intelligence in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) is used to construct a novel framework for smart radars, called Parallel Radars. A Parallel Radar consists of three main parts: a Descriptive Radar for constructing artificial radar systems in cyberspace, a Predictive Radar for conducting computational experiments with artificial systems, and a Prescriptive Radar for providing prescriptive control to both physical and artificial radars to complete parallel execution. To connect silos of data and protect data privacy, federated radars are proposed. Additionally, taking mines as an example, the application of Parallel Radars in autonomous driving is discussed in detail, and various experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of Parallel Radars.", "Recently, there has been a growing interest in the consensus of a multi-agent system (MAS) with advances in artificial intelligence and distributed computing. Sliding mode control (SMC) is a well-known method that provides robust control in the presence of uncertainties. While our previous study introduced SMC to the reinforcement learning (RL) based on approximate dynamic programming in the context of optimal control, SMC is introduced to a conventional RL framework in this work. As a specific realization, the modified twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for consensus was exploited to develop sliding mode RL. Numerical experiments show that the sliding mode RL outperforms existing state-of-the-art RL methods and model-based methods in terms of the mean square error (MSE) performance.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining strength, and materials science can both contribute to and profit from it. In a simultaneous progress race, new materials, systems, and processes can be devised and optimized thanks to machine learning (ML) techniques, and such progress can be turned into innovative computing platforms. Future materials scientists will profit from understanding how ML can boost the conception of advanced materials. This review covers aspects of computation from the fundamentals to directions taken and repercussions produced by computation to account for the origins, procedures, and applications of AI. ML and its methods are reviewed to provide basic knowledge of its implementation and its potential. The materials and systems used to implement AI with electric charges are finding serious competition from other information-carrying and processing agents. The impact these techniques have on the inception of new advanced materials is so deep that a new paradigm is developing where implicit knowledge is being mined to conceive materials and systems for functions instead of finding applications to found materials. How far this trend can be carried is hard to fathom, as exemplified by the power to discover unheard of materials or physical laws buried in data.", "Artificial intelligence education will be an important part of information technology education in the future. It will enter the classroom and the learning life of students in various forms. The modern teaching media used in artificial intelligence courses at universities include some conventional teaching courseware, multimedia videos, and tool software. Some teaching media are unique to artificial intelligence, such as smart software, smart devices, and smart websites. The existing cross-cultural competence dimensions and evaluation scales were theoretically explained with factor analysis by comparing and selecting comprehensive evaluation methods in the work. Its main advantages were as follows: simple mathematical models and easy operation. The construction of a comprehensive evaluation model for college students' cross-cultural competence included the principles and ideas of model construction, the methods and steps of model construction, and model calculations. The survey results showed that the four-level scores of all samples had a significant positive correlation with foreign cultural knowledge, attitudes, and cross-cultural communication skills at 0.01 level (bilateral) and 0.05 (bilateral), respectively.", "Randomised controlled trials, including the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the NELSON trial, have shown reduced mortality with lung cancer screening with low-dose CT compared with chest radiography or no screening. Although research has provided clarity on key issues of lung cancer screening, uncertainty remains about aspects that might be critical to optimise clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. This Review brings together current evidence on lung cancer screening, including an overview of clinical trials, considerations regarding the identification of individuals who benefit from lung cancer screening, management of screen-detected findings, smoking cessation interventions, cost-effectiveness, the role of artificial intelligence and biomarkers, and current challenges, solutions, and opportunities surrounding the implementation of lung cancer screening programmes from an international perspective. Further research into risk models for patient selection, personalised screening intervals, novel biomarkers, integrated cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessments, smoking cessation interventions, and artificial intelligence for lung nodule detection and risk stratification are key opportunities to increase the efficiency of lung cancer screening and ensure equity of access.", "Neoruscogenin is a plant-origin sapogenin that has the potential to modulate muscle growth among the small-molecule compounds that we previously predicted by artificial intelligence to target myostatin (MSTN). This study aimed to elucidate the biological role of neoruscogenin on muscle growth and its relationship with MSTN. Using molecular biological techniques, we found that neoruscogenin inhibited MSTN maturation, thereby repressing its signal transduction; further facilitated protein synthesis metabolism and reduced protein degradation metabolism, ultimately promoting the differentiation of myoblasts and hypertrophy of muscle fibers; and had the effect of repairing muscle injury. This study enriched the biological functions of neoruscogenin and provided a theoretical basis for the treatment of human myopathy and its application in the livestock industry.", "Chemical agents are one of the major threats to soldiers in modern warfare, so it is so important to detect chemical agents rapidly and accurately on battlefields. Raman spectroscopy-based detectors are widely used but have many limitations. The Raman spectrum changes unpredictably due to various environmental factors, and it is hard for detectors to make appropriate judgments about new chemical substances without prior information. Thus, the existing detectors with inflexible techniques based on determined rules cannot deal with such problems flexibly and reactively. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based detection techniques can be good alternatives to the existing techniques for chemical agent detection. To build AI-based detection systems, sufficient amounts of data for training are required, but it is not easy to produce and handle fatal chemical agents, which causes difficulty in securing data in advance. To overcome the limitations, in this paper, we propose the distributed Raman spectrum data augmentation system that leverages federated learning (FL) with deep generative models, such as generative adversarial network (GAN) and autoencoder. Furthermore, the proposed system utilizes various additional techniques in combination to generate a large number of Raman spectrum data with reality along with diversity. We implemented the proposed system and conducted diverse experiments to evaluate the system. The evaluation results validated that the proposed system can train the models more quickly through cooperation among decentralized troops without exchanging raw data and generate realistic Raman spectrum data well. Moreover, we confirmed that the classification model on the proposed system performed learning much faster and outperformed the existing systems.", "The use of images of persons in a pornographic context (without the prior consent of the person concerned) on the internet is an increasingly widespread infringement. Unlawful activities carried out with the use of generated images and artificial intelligence are a variant of this phenomenon. \"Revenge porn\" and \"deepfake porn\" illustrate the inadequacy of legal systems vis a vis the fast-changing reality. Using the comparative law method, a comparison was made between the current laws of nine EU Member States to create a map of protection for victims of revenge porn. As the results showed, in three of the studied countries there is a separate incrimination of revenge porn; however, the conceptual scope of its definition is significantly different and it is these differences that determine the legal way for the victims to assert their rights. This article is a comparison of the current legal regulations of selected European Union countries and the means of legal protection used by the victims. The text presents the differences occurring in the legal systems adopted in the countries subject to analysis, as well as an assessment of possible solutions at the legal and technological level to face the existing problem.", "Artificial intelligence plays an essential role in diagnosing lung cancer. Lung cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose until it has progressed to a late stage, making it a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Lung cancer is fatal if not treated early, making this a significant issue. Initial diagnosis of malignant nodules is often made using chest radiography (X-ray) and computed tomography (CT) scans; nevertheless, the possibility of benign nodules leads to wrong choices. In their first phases, benign and malignant nodules seem very similar. Additionally, radiologists have a hard time viewing and categorizing lung abnormalities. Lung cancer screenings performed by radiologists are often performed with the use of computer-aided diagnostic technologies. Computer scientists have presented many methods for identifying lung cancer in recent years. Low-quality images compromise the segmentation process, rendering traditional lung cancer prediction algorithms inaccurate. This article suggests a highly effective strategy for identifying and categorizing lung cancer. Noise in the pictures was reduced using a weighted filter, and the improved Gray Wolf Optimization method was performed before segmentation with watershed modification and dilation operations. We used InceptionNet-V3 to classify lung cancer into three groups, and it performed well compared to prior studies: 98.96% accuracy, 94.74% specificity, as well as 100% sensitivity.", "Clinical implications of different types of vascular calcification are poorly understood. The two most abundant forms of calcification, nodular and sheet calcification, have not been quantitatively analyzed in relation to the clinical presentation of lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD).\nThe study analyzed 51 femoral artery plaques collected during femoral endarterectomy, characterized by the presence of\u2009>\u200990% stenosis. Comprehensive clinical data was obtained from patient records, including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images, toe pressure and ankle brachial index measurements and laboratory values. The plaques were longitudinally sectioned, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and digitized in a deep learning platform for quantification of the relative area of nodular and sheet calcification to the plaque section area. A deep learning artificial intelligence algorithm was designed and independently validated to reliably quantify nodular calcification and sheet calcification. Vessel measurements and quantity of each calcification category was compared to the risk factors and clinical presentation.\nOn average,\u2009>\u200990% stenosed vessels contained 22.4\u2009\u00b1\u200912.3% of nodular and 14.5\u2009\u00b1\u200911.8% of sheet calcification. Nodular calcification area proportion in lesions with\u2009>\u200990% stenosis is associated with reduced risk of critically low toe pressure (<\u200930\u00a0mmHg) (OR\u2009=\u20090.910, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.835-0.992, p\u2009<\u20090.05), severely lowered ankle brachial index (<\u20090.4) (OR\u2009=\u20090.912, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.84-0.986, p\u2009<\u20090.05), and semi-urgent operation (OR\u2009=\u20090.882, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.797-0.976, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Sheet calcification did not show any significant association.\nLarge amount of nodular calcification is associated with less severe LEAD. Patients with nodular calcification may have better flow reserves despite local obstruction.", "The computational methods used for engineering antibodies for clinical development have undergone a transformation from three-dimensional structure-guided approaches to artificial-intelligence- and machine-learning-based approaches that leverage the large sequence data space of hundreds of millions of antibodies generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. Building on the wealth of available sequence data, we implemented a computational shuffling approach to antibody components, using the complementarity-determining region (CDR) and the framework region (FWR) to optimize an antibody for improved affinity and developability. This approach uses a set of rules to suitably combine the CDRs and FWRs derived from naturally occurring antibody sequences to engineer an antibody with high affinity and specificity. To illustrate this approach, we selected a representative SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody, H4, which was identified and isolated previously based on the predominant germlines that were employed in a human host to target the SARS-CoV-2-human ACE2 receptor interaction. Compared to screening vast CDR libraries for affinity enhancements, our approach identified fewer than 100 antibody framework-CDR combinations, from which we screened and selected an antibody (CB79) that showed a reduced dissociation rate and improved affinity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (7-fold) when compared to H4. The improved affinity also translated into improved neutralization (>75-fold improvement) of SARS-CoV-2. Our rapid and robust approach for optimizing antibodies from parts without the need for tedious structure-guided CDR optimization will have broad utility for biotechnological applications.", "The search for non-invasive, fast, and low-cost diagnostic tools has gained significant traction among many researchers worldwide. Dielectric properties calculated from microwave signals offer unique insights into biological tissue. Material properties, such as relative permittivity (\u03b5r) and conductivity (\u03c3), can vary significantly between healthy and unhealthy tissue types at a given frequency. Understanding this difference in properties is key for identifying the disease state. The frequency-dependent nature of the dielectric measurements results in large datasets, which can be postprocessed using artificial intelligence (AI) methods. In this work, the dielectric properties of liver tissues in three mouse models of liver disease are characterized using dielectric spectroscopy. The measurements are grouped into four categories based on the diets or disease state of the mice, i.e., healthy mice, mice with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced by choline-deficient high-fat diet, mice with NASH induced by western diet, and mice with liver fibrosis. Multi-class classification machine learning (ML) models are then explored to differentiate the liver tissue groups based on dielectric measurements. The results show that the support vector machine (SVM) model was able to differentiate the tissue groups with an accuracy up to 90%. This technology pipeline, thus, shows great potential for developing the next generation non-invasive diagnostic tools.", "A novel artificial intelligence-assisted evaluation of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak profiles was elaborated for the characterization of the nanocrystallite microstructure in a combinatorial Co-Cr-Fe-Ni compositionally complex alloy (CCA) film. The layer was produced by a multiple beam sputtering physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique on a Si single crystal substrate with the diameter of about 10 cm. This new processing technique is able to produce combinatorial CCA films where the elemental concentrations vary in a wide range on the disk surface. The most important benefit of the combinatorial sample is that it can be used for the study of the correlation between the chemical composition and the microstructure on a single specimen. The microstructure can be characterized quickly in many points on the disk surface using synchrotron XRD. However, the evaluation of the diffraction patterns for the crystallite size and the density of lattice defects (e.g., dislocations and twin faults) using X-ray line profile analysis (XLPA) is not possible in a reasonable amount of time due to the large number (hundreds) of XRD patterns. In the present study, a machine learning-based X-ray line profile analysis (ML-XLPA) was developed and tested on the combinatorial Co-Cr-Fe-Ni film. The new method is able to produce maps of the characteristic parameters of the nanostructure (crystallite size, defect densities) on the disk surface very quickly. Since the novel technique was developed and tested only for face-centered cubic (FCC) structures, additional work is required for the extension of its applicability to other materials. Nevertheless, to the knowledge of the authors, this is the first ML-XLPA evaluation method in the literature, which can pave the way for further development of this methodology.", "The Internet of things is a popular concept in the current digital revolution. Nowadays, devices worldwide can be connected to the Internet, enhancing their communication, capabilities, and intelligence. Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) was specifically designed to build wireless networks for IoT resource-constrained devices. However, 6LoWPAN is susceptible to several security attacks. The fragmentation mechanism, in particular, is vulnerable to various attacks due to the lack of fragment authentication and verification procedures in the adaptation layer. This article provides a survey of fragmentation attacks and available countermeasures. Furthermore, the buffer reservation attack, one of the most harmful fragmentation attacks that may cause DoS, is studied and simulated in detail. A countermeasure for this attack is also implemented based on a reputation-scoring scheme. Experiments showed the harmful effects of the buffer reservation attack and the effectiveness of the implemented reputation-scoring countermeasure.", "Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery is an established technique for the resection of sellar and suprasellar lesions. The approach is technically challenging and has a steep learning curve. Simulation is a growing training tool, allowing the acquisition of technical skills pre-clinically and potentially resulting in a shorter clinical learning curve. We sought validation of the UpSurgeOn Transsphenoidal (TNS) Box for the endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach to the pituitary fossa.\nNovice, intermediate and expert neurosurgeons were recruited from multiple centres. Participants were asked to perform a sphenoidotomy using the TNS model. Face and content validity were evaluated using a post-task questionnaire. Construct validity was assessed through post-hoc blinded scoring of operative videos using a Modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (mOSAT) and a Task-Specific Technical Skill scoring system.\nFifteen participants were recruited of which n\u2009=\u200910 (66.6%) were novices and n\u2009=\u20095 (33.3%) were intermediate and expert neurosurgeons. Three intermediate and experts (60%) agreed that the model was realistic. All intermediate and experts (n\u2009=\u20095) strongly agreed or agreed that the TNS model was useful for teaching the endonasal transsphenoidal approach to the pituitary fossa. The consensus-derived mOSAT score was 16/30 (IQR 14-16.75) for novices and 29/30 (IQR 27-29) for intermediate and experts (p\u2009<\u20090.001, Mann-Whitney U). The median Task-Specific Technical Skill score was 10/20 (IQR 8.25-13) for novices and 18/20 (IQR 17.75-19) for intermediate and experts (p\u2009<\u20090.001, Mann-Whitney U). Interrater reliability was 0.949 (CI 0.983-0.853) for OSATS and 0.945 (CI 0.981-0.842) for Task-Specific Technical Skills. Suggested improvements for the model included the addition of neuro-vascular anatomy and arachnoid mater to simulate bleeding vessels and CSF leak, respectively, as well as improvement in materials to reproduce the consistency closer to that of human tissue and bone.\nThe TNS Box simulation model has demonstrated face, content, and construct validity as a simulator for the endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. With the steep learning curve associated with endoscopic approaches, this simulation model has the potential as a valuable training tool in neurosurgery with further improvements including advancing simulation materials, dynamic models (e.g., with blood flow) and synergy with complementary technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and augmented reality).", "With the development of artificial intelligence technology and computer hardware functions, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful auxiliary tool for medical image analysis. This study was an attempt to use statistical methods to analyze studies related to the detection, segmentation, and classification of breast cancer in pathological images. After an analysis of 107 articles on the application of deep learning to pathological images of breast cancer, this study is divided into three directions based on the types of results they report: detection, segmentation, and classification. We introduced and analyzed models that performed well in these three directions and summarized the related work from recent years. Based on the results obtained, the significant ability of deep learning in the application of breast cancer pathological images can be recognized. Furthermore, in the classification and detection of pathological images of breast cancer, the accuracy of deep learning algorithms has surpassed that of pathologists in certain circumstances. Our study provides a comprehensive review of the development of breast cancer pathological imaging-related research and provides reliable recommendations for the structure of deep learning network models in different application scenarios.", "Drug discovery is usually a rule-based process that is carefully carried out by pharmacists. However, a new trend is emerging in research and practice where artificial intelligence is being used for drug discovery to increase efficiency or to develop new drugs for previously untreatable diseases. Nevertheless, so far, no study takes a holistic view of AI-based drug discovery research. Given the importance and potential of AI for drug discovery, this lack of research is surprising. This study aimed to close this research gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis to identify all relevant studies and to analyze interrelationships among algorithms, institutions, countries, and funding sponsors. For this purpose, a sample of 3884 articles was examined bibliometrically, including studies from 1991 to 2022. We utilized various qualitative and quantitative methods, such as performance analysis, science mapping, and thematic analysis. Based on these findings, we furthermore developed a research agenda that aims to serve as a foundation for future researchers.", "State-of-the-art healthcare technologies are incorporating advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, allowing for rapid and easy disease diagnosis. However, most AI models are considered \"black boxes,\" because there is no explanation for the decisions made by these models. Users may find it challenging to comprehend and interpret the results. Explainable AI (XAI) can explain the machine learning (ML) outputs and contribution of features in disease prediction models. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a potential predictive tool for understanding cortical impairment caused by an ischemic stroke and can be utilized for acute stroke prediction, neurologic prognosis, and post-stroke treatment. This study aims to utilize ML models to classify the ischemic stroke group and the healthy control group for acute stroke prediction in active states. Moreover, XAI tools (Eli5 and LIME) were utilized to explain the behavior of the model and determine the significant features that contribute to stroke prediction models. In this work, we studied 48 patients admitted to a hospital with acute ischemic stroke and 75 healthy adults who had no history of identified other neurological illnesses. EEG was obtained within three months following the onset of ischemic stroke symptoms using frontal, central, temporal, and occipital cortical electrodes (Fz, C1, T7, Oz). EEG data were collected in an active state (walking, working, and reading tasks). In the results of the ML approach, the Adaptive Gradient Boosting models showed around 80% accuracy for the classification of the control group and the stroke group. Eli5 and LIME were utilized to explain the behavior of the stroke prediction model and interpret the model locally around the prediction. The Eli5 and LIME interpretable models emphasized the spectral delta and theta features as local contributors to stroke prediction. From the findings of this explainable AI research, it is expected that the stroke-prediction XAI model will help with post-stroke treatment and recovery, as well as help healthcare professionals, make their diagnostic decisions more explainable.", "Liver transplantation outcomes have improved in recent years. However, with the emergence of expanded donor criteria, tools to better assist donor-recipient matching have become necessary. Most of the currently proposed scores based on conventional biostatistics are not good classifiers of a problem that is considered \"unbalanced.\" In recent years, the implementation of artificial intelligence in medicine has experienced exponential growth. Deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, may be the answer to this classification problem. The ability to handle a large number of variables with speed, objectivity, and multi-objective analysis is one of its advantages. Artificial neural networks and random forests have been the most widely used deep classifiers in this field. This review aims to give a brief overview of D-R matching and its evolution in recent years and how artificial intelligence may be able to provide a solution.", "Edge artificial intelligence (EDGE-AI) refers to the execution of artificial intelligence algorithms on hardware devices while processing sensor data/signals in order to extract information and identify patterns, without utilizing the cloud. In the field of predictive maintenance for industrial applications, EDGE-AI systems can provide operational state recognition for machines and production chains, almost in real time. This work presents two methodological approaches for the detection of the operational states of a DC motor, based on sound data. Initially, features were extracted using an audio dataset. Two different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were trained for the particular classification problem. These two models are subject to post-training quantization and an appropriate conversion/compression in order to be deployed to microcontroller units (MCUs) through utilizing appropriate software tools. A real-time validation experiment was conducted, including the simulation of a custom stress test environment, to check the deployed models' performance on the recognition of the engine's operational states and the response time for the transition between the engine's states. Finally, the two implementations were compared in terms of classification accuracy, latency, and resource utilization, leading to promising results.", "The intelligent transportation system, especially autonomous vehicles, has seen a lot of interest among researchers owing to the tremendous work in modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, especially deep neural learning. As a result of increased road accidents over the last few decades, significant industries are moving to design and develop autonomous vehicles. Understanding the surrounding environment is essential for understanding the behavior of nearby vehicles to enable the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles in crowded traffic environments. Several datasets are available for autonomous vehicles focusing only on structured driving environments. To develop an intelligent vehicle that drives in real-world traffic environments, which are unstructured by nature, there should be an availability of a dataset for an autonomous vehicle that focuses on unstructured traffic environments. Indian Driving Lite dataset (IDD-Lite), focused on an unstructured driving environment, was released as an online competition in NCPPRIPG 2019. This study proposed an explainable inception-based U-Net model with Grad-CAM visualization for semantic segmentation that combines an inception-based module as an encoder for automatic extraction of features and passes to a decoder for the reconstruction of the segmentation feature map. The black-box nature of deep neural networks failed to build trust within consumers. Grad-CAM is used to interpret the deep-learning-based inception U-Net model to increase consumer trust. The proposed inception U-net with Grad-CAM model achieves 0.622 intersection over union (IoU) on the Indian Driving Dataset (IDD-Lite), outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep neural-network-based segmentation models.", "Emerging observational evidence suggests links between cognitive impairment and a range of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders; however, the mechanisms underlying their relationships remain unclear. Leveraging large-scale genome-wide association studies\u2019 summary statistics, we comprehensively assessed genetic overlap and potential causality of cognitive traits and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) with several GIT disorders. We demonstrate a strong and highly significant inverse global genetic correlation between cognitive traits and GIT disorders\u2014peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastritis-duodenitis, diverticulosis, irritable bowel syndrome, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but not inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Further analysis detects 35 significant (p < 4.37 \u00d7 10\u22125) bivariate local genetic correlations between cognitive traits, AD, and GIT disorders (including IBD). Mendelian randomisation analysis suggests a risk-decreasing causality of educational attainment, intelligence, and other cognitive traits on PUD and GERD, but not IBD, and a putative association of GERD with cognitive function decline. Gene-based analysis reveals a significant gene-level genetic overlap of cognitive traits with AD and GIT disorders (IBD inclusive, pbinomial-test\u2009=\u20091.18 \u00d7 10\u22123\u22122.20 \u00d7 10\u221216). Our study supports the protective roles of genetically-influenced educational attainments and other cognitive traits on the risk of GIT disorders and highlights a putative association of GERD with cognitive function decline. Findings from local genetic correlation analysis provide novel insights, indicating that the relationship of IBD with cognitive traits (and AD) will depend largely on their local effects across the genome.", "For inertial navigation systems (INS), as one of the major methods for underwater navigation, errors diverge over time. With the development of geophysical navigation technology, gravity navigation has become an effective method of navigation. Significant changes in the gravity characteristic of the matching region ensure that gravity matching navigation works effectively. In this paper, we combine artificial intelligence algorithms and statistical metrics to classify gravity-matching navigation regions. Firstly, this paper analyzes and extracts gravity anomaly data from a matching region in different ways. Then, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the network weights of a back propagation (BP) NN. Finally, based on principal component analysis (PCA) theory and PSO-BP NN, this paper proposes the PPBA method to classify the matching area. Moreover, the Terrain Contour Matching (TERCOM) matching algorithm and gravity anomaly data from the Western Pacific are used to verify the classification performance of the PPBA method. The experiments prove that the PPBA method has a high classification accuracy, and the classification results are consistent with the matching navigation experimental results. This work can provide a reference for designing navigation regions and navigation routes for submarines.", "Text document clustering is one of the data mining techniques used in many real-world applications such as information retrieval from IoT Sensors data, duplicate content detection, and document organization. Swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms are suitable for solving complex text document clustering problems compared to traditional clustering algorithms. The previous studies show that in SI algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) provides an effective solution to text document clustering problems. This PSO still needs to be improved to avoid the problems such as premature convergence to local optima. In this paper, an approach called dynamic sub-swarm of PSO (subswarm-PSO) is proposed to improve the results of PSO for text document clustering problems and avoid the local optimum by improving the global search capabilities of PSO. The results of this proposed approach were compared with the standard PSO algorithm and K-means algorithm. As for performance assurance, the evaluation metric purity is used with six benchmark data sets. The experimental results of this study show that our proposed subswarm-PSO algorithm performs best with high purity comparing the standard PSO and K-means traditional algorithms and also the execution time of subswarm-PSO comparatively takes a little less than the standard PSO algorithm.", "This paper presents the findings of detailed and comprehensive technical literature aimed at identifying the current and future research challenges of tactical autonomy. It discusses in great detail the current state-of-the-art powerful artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and robot technologies, and their potential for developing safe and robust autonomous systems in the context of future military and defense applications. Additionally, we discuss some of the technical and operational critical challenges that arise when attempting to practically build fully autonomous systems for advanced military and defense applications. Our paper provides the state-of-the-art advanced AI methods available for tactical autonomy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the important current trends, strategies, critical challenges, tactical complexities, and future research directions of tactical autonomy. We believe this work will greatly interest researchers and scientists from academia and the industry working in the field of robotics and the autonomous systems community. We hope this work encourages researchers across multiple disciplines of AI to explore the broader tactical autonomy domain. We also hope that our work serves as an essential step toward designing advanced AI and ML models with practical implications for real-world military and defense settings.", "When combined with diverse sensors, soft robots significantly improve their functionalities and intelligence levels. However, most of the existing soft sensors require complex signal analysis devices or algorithms, which severely increase the complexity of soft robot systems. Here, based on the unique fluidic property of liquid metal, we propose a magnet-controllable soft microswitch that can be well-integrated into a soft robot system, e.g., a soft gripper to help it facilely detect and precisely grab objects. The microswitch consists of a flexible soft beam electrode and a fixed electrode, forming a soft microsystem. By tuning the cohesion force of the liquid metal between the electrodes, the microswitch can convert its states between an individual and a self-locking state. The microswitch can achieve a reasonable rapid response (~12 ms) and high switching frequency (~95 Hz). Furthermore, soft microswitches can be customized into logic units and also coupled to control a digital tube showing various numbers. Our work provides a new simple soft sensor unit that may enhance the intelligence of soft systems.", "The data processing of multi-wavelength pyrometry (MWP) is faced with the problem of solving N equations and N+1 unknown underdetermined equations. The traditional iterative optimization methods are difficult to meet the actual measurement requirements in terms of accuracy and efficiency. With the development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of data processing, it is expected to solve this problem. A generalized inverse matrix (GIM) is combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network algorithm for data processing of MWP is proposed, which emissivity influence is dispensed completely. Firstly, GIM is used for classification of the emissivity. Furthermore, inputting to the LSTM network not only ensures the accuracy of temperature measurement but also greatly improves the efficiency. The simulation results demonstrated that the accuracy of the GIM-LSTM algorithm was superior to that of the GIM-EPF and BP methods. After random noise was added, the relative error was still less than that for the GIM-EPF and BP methods, and the algorithm exhibited excellent anti-noise performance. Publicly available temperature data for the exhaust plume of a rocket engine were processed by the GIM-LSTM method, and the average relative error was less than the traditional method. Especially, in terms of inversion speed, the operational time of the GIM-LSTM algorithm was at the millisecond level, which is of great significance for the real-time monitoring of rocket exhaust plumes. The proposed GIM-LSTM data processing algorithm affords high accuracy and speed and is suitable for practical measurement of high-emissivity objects in real-time via MWP.", "This study explored the effects of partly supervised physical exercise program (PSPEP) intervention compared to fully supervised physical exercise program (FSPEP) on cognitive functions, movement proficiency and problematic internet use (PIU) in adolescents presenting combined unhealthy lifestyle behaviors.\nOver a period of 16 weeks the PSPEP group (n = 14) engaged in strength, balance and flexibility exercises three times per week with one supervised session and two unsupervised. The FSPEP group (n = 13) practiced dance activities for 2 to 4 days per week including in training sessions the same exercises as for the PSPEP group. Prior and after the study adolescents completed the PIU scale, performed movement proficiency and cognitive function tests.\nThe PSPEP had significant effect on improvement of stress tolerance (p < 0.01, g = 1.08), while the FSPEP had significant effect on contributing general intelligence (p < 0.05, g = 0.90), color-word interference of the reading speed or color recognition (p < 0.01, g = 1.33), short- and long-term memory (p < 0.01, g = 1.72) and stress tolerance (p < 0.05, g = 1.06). The PSPEP had significant effect on improvement of the bilateral coordination (p < 0.01, g = 1.08). None of the two programs had effect on PIU.\nEngagement in PSPEP selectively contributed bilateral coordination and cognitive skills related to reaction to multiple stimuli. The FSPEP had multiple significant effects in improvement of cognitive outcomes.", "We propose a new generative model named adaptive cycle-consistent generative adversarial network, or Ad CycleGAN to perform image translation between normal and COVID-19 positive chest X-ray images. An independent pre-trained criterion is added to the conventional Cycle GAN architecture to exert adaptive control on image translation. The performance of Ad CycleGAN is compared with the Cycle GAN without the external criterion. The quality of the synthetic images is evaluated by quantitative metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQI), visual information fidelity (VIF), Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and translation accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the synthetic images generated either by the Cycle GAN or by the Ad CycleGAN have lower MSE and RMSE, and higher scores in PSNR, UIQI, and VIF in homogenous image translation (i.e., Y \u2192 Y) compared to the heterogenous image translation process (i.e., X \u2192 Y). The synthetic images by Ad CycleGAN through the heterogeneous image translation have significantly higher FID score compared to Cycle GAN (p < 0.01). The image translation accuracy of Ad CycleGAN is higher than that of Cycle GAN when normal images are converted to COVID-19 positive images (p < 0.01). Therefore, we conclude that the Ad CycleGAN with the independent criterion can improve the accuracy of GAN image translation. The new architecture has more control on image synthesis and can help address the common class imbalance issue in machine learning methods and artificial intelligence applications with medical images.", "Background and Objectives: Survival estimation for patients diagnosed with Glioblastoma (GBM) is an important information to consider in patient management and communication. Despite some known risk factors, survival estimation remains a major challenge. Novel non-invasive technologies such as radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) have been implemented to increase the accuracy of these predictions. In this article, we reviewed and discussed the most significant available research on survival estimation for GBM through advanced non-invasive methods. Materials and Methods: PubMed database was queried for articles reporting on survival prognosis for GBM through advanced image and data management methods. Articles including in their title or abstract the following terms were initially screened: ((glioma) AND (survival)) AND ((artificial intelligence) OR (radiomics)). Exclusively English full-text articles, reporting on humans, published as of 1 September 2022 were considered. Articles not reporting on overall survival, evaluating the effects of new therapies or including other tumors were excluded. Research with a radiomics-based methodology were evaluated using the radiomics quality score (RQS). Results: 382 articles were identified. After applying the inclusion criteria, 46 articles remained for further analysis. These articles were thoroughly assessed, summarized and discussed. The results of the RQS revealed some of the limitations of current radiomics investigation on this field. Limitations of analyzed studies included data availability, patient selection and heterogeneity of methodologies. Future challenges on this field are increasing data availability, improving the general understanding of how AI handles data and establishing solid correlations between image features and tumor's biology. Conclusions: Radiomics and AI methods of data processing offer a new paradigm of possibilities to tackle the question of survival prognosis in GBM.", "The gravitational search algorithm is a global optimization algorithm that has the advantages of a swarm intelligence algorithm. Compared with traditional algorithms, the performance in terms of global search and convergence is relatively good, but the solution is not always accurate, and the algorithm has difficulty jumping out of locally optimal solutions. In view of these shortcomings, an improved gravitational search algorithm based on an adaptive strategy is proposed. The algorithm uses the adaptive strategy to improve the updating methods for the distance between particles, gravitational constant, and position in the gravitational search model. This strengthens the information interaction between particles in the group and improves the exploration and exploitation capacity of the algorithm. In this paper, 13 classical single-peak and multi-peak test functions were selected for simulation performance tests, and the CEC2017 benchmark function was used for a comparison test. The test results show that the improved gravitational search algorithm can address the tendency of the original algorithm to fall into local extrema and significantly improve both the solution accuracy and the ability to find the globally optimal solution.", "Microneedles are micron-sized devices that are used for the transdermal administration of a wide range of active pharmaceutics substances with minimally invasive pain. In the past decade, various additive manufacturing technologies have been used for the fabrication of microneedles; however, they have limitations due to material compatibility and bioavailability and are time-consuming and expensive processes. Additive manufacturing (AM), which is popularly known as 3D-printing, is an innovative technology that builds three-dimensional solid objects (3D). This article provides a comprehensive review of the different 3D-printing technologies that have the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing of microneedles. The application of 3D-printed microneedles in various fields, such as drug delivery, vaccine delivery, cosmetics, therapy, tissue engineering, and diagnostics, are presented. This review also enumerates the challenges that are posed by the 3D-printing technologies, including the manufacturing cost, which limits its viability for large-scale production, the compatibility of the microneedle-based materials with human cells, and concerns around the efficient administration of large dosages of loaded microneedles. Furthermore, the optimization of microneedle design parameters and features for the best printing outcomes is of paramount interest. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory guidelines relating to the safe use of microneedle devices are outlined. Finally, this review delineates the implementation of futuristic technologies, such as artificial intelligence algorithms, for 3D-printed microneedles and 4D-printing capabilities.", "Medical students face daily challenges such as large workload, time commitment and clinical environment pressure leading to a higher risk of psychological distress. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between personality traits and depression, anxiety, and stress among Lebanese medical students and to evaluate the mediating role of emotional intelligence (EI) in this association. This cross-sectional study was conducted between June and December of 2019. Participants were from seven medical schools in Lebanon. Higher extraversion (B = -0.11), higher neuroticism (B = -0.28) and higher emotional intelligence (B = -0.03) were significantly associated with lower depression. Higher neuroticism (B = -0.29) and higher emotional intelligence (B = -0.03) were significantly associated with lower anxiety. Higher openness to experience (B = 0.07) and higher agreeableness (B = 0.08) were significantly associated with higher stress, whereas higher neuroticism (B = -0.05) was associated with lower stress. EI mediated the association between extraversion and depression and openness to experience and depression. EI mediated the association between extraversion and anxiety and openness to experience and anxiety. The results of this study were different from those previously cited in the literature. This could be secondary to the mediating role of emotional intelligence. This study consequently opens up the possibility of new studies highlighting the role of emotional intelligence in the possible preservation of medical students' mental health.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually being utilized in various fields as its performance has been improving with the development of deep learning methods, availability of big data, and the progression of computer processing units. In the field of medicine, AI is mainly implemented in image recognition, such as in radiographic and pathologic diagnoses. In the realm of gastrointestinal endoscopy, although AI-based computer-assisted detection/diagnosis (CAD) systems have been applied in some areas, such as colorectal polyp detection and diagnosis, so far, their implementation in real-world clinical settings is limited. The accurate detection or diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC) is one of the challenges in which performance varies greatly depending on the endoscopist's skill. The diagnosis of early GC is especially challenging, partly because early GC mimics atrophic gastritis in the background mucosa. Therefore, several CAD systems for GC are being actively developed. The development of a CAD system for GC is considered challenging because it requires a large number of GC images. In particular, early stage GC images are rarely available, partly because it is difficult to diagnose gastric cancer during the early stages. Additionally, the training image data should be of a sufficiently high quality to conduct proper CAD training. Recently, several AI systems for GC that exhibit a robust performance, owing to being trained on a large number of high-quality images, have been reported. This review outlines the current status and prospects of AI use in esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS), focusing on the diagnosis of GC.", "The targeted delivery of cancer immunotherapies has increased noticeably in recent years. Recent advancements in immunotherapy, particularly in blocking the immune checkpoints (ICs) axis, have shown favorable treatment outcomes for multiple types of cancer including melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSLC). Engineered micromachines, including microparticles, and nanoplatforms (organic and inorganic), functionalized with immune agonists can effectively deliver immune-targeting molecules to solid tumors. This review focuses on the nanomaterial-based strategies that have shown promise in identifying and targeting various immunological markers in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Nanomaterials-based cancer immunotherapy has improved treatment outcomes by triggering an immune response in the TME. Evaluating the expression levels of ICs in the TME also could potentially aid in diagnosing patients who would respond to IC blockade therapy. Detecting immunological checkpoints in the TME using noninvasive imaging systems via tailored nanosensors improves the identification of patient outcomes in immuno-oncology (IO). To enhance patient-specific analysis, lab-on-chip (LOC) technology is a rapid, cost-effective, and accurate way of recapitulating the TME. Such novel nanomaterial-based technologies have been of great interest for testing immunotherapies and assessing biomarkers. Finally, we provide a perspective on the developments in artificial intelligence tools to facilitate ICs-based nano theranostics toward cancer immunotherapy.", "Statistics show that an estimated 64 million people worldwide suffer from glaucoma. To aid in the detection of this disease, this paper presents a new public dataset containing eye fundus images that was developed for glaucoma pattern-recognition studies using deep learning (DL). The dataset, denoted Brazil Glaucoma, comprises 2000 images obtained from 1000 volunteers categorized into two groups: those with glaucoma (50%) and those without glaucoma (50%). All images were captured with a smartphone attached to a Welch Allyn panoptic direct ophthalmoscope. Further, a DL approach for the automatic detection of glaucoma was developed using the new dataset as input to a convolutional neural network ensemble model. The accuracy between positive and negative glaucoma detection, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated using five-fold cross-validation to train and refine the classification model. The results showed that the proposed method can identify glaucoma from eye fundus images with an accuracy of 90.0%. Thus, the combination of fundus images obtained using a smartphone attached to a portable panoptic ophthalmoscope and artificial intelligence algorithms yielded satisfactory results in the overall accuracy of glaucoma detection tests. Consequently, the proposed approach can contribute to the development of technologies aimed at massive population screening of the disease.", "The development of genomic technology for smart diagnosis and therapies for various diseases has lately been the most demanding area for computer-aided diagnostic and treatment research. Exponential breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and machine intelligence technologies could pave the way for identifying challenges afflicting the healthcare industry. Genomics is paving the way for predicting future illnesses, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. Machine learning advancements have expedited the pace of biomedical informatics research and inspired new branches of computational biology. Furthermore, knowing gene relationships has resulted in developing more accurate models that can effectively detect patterns in vast volumes of data, making classification models important in various domains. Recurrent Neural Network models have a memory that allows them to quickly remember knowledge from previous cycles and process genetic data. The present work focuses on type 2 diabetes prediction using gene sequences derived from genomic DNA fragments through automated feature selection and feature extraction procedures for matching gene patterns with training data. The suggested model was tested using tabular data to predict type 2 diabetes based on several parameters. The performance of neural networks incorporating Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) components, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) was tested in this research. The model's efficiency is assessed using the evaluation metrics such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, F1-Score, and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The suggested technique predicted future illnesses with fair Accuracy. Furthermore, our research showed that the suggested model could be used in real-world scenarios and that input risk variables from an end-user Android application could be kept and evaluated on a secure remote server.", "Substantial milestones have been attained in the field of heart failure (HF) diagnostics and therapeutics in the past several years that have translated into decreased mortality but a paradoxical increase in HF-related hospitalizations. With increasing data digitalization and access, remote monitoring via wearables and implantables have the potential to transform ambulatory care workflow, with a particular focus on reducing HF hospitalizations. Additionally, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have been increasingly employed at multiple stages of healthcare due to their power in assimilating and integrating multidimensional multimodal data and the creation of accurate prediction models. With the ever-increasing troves of data, the implementation of AI/ML algorithms could help improve workflow and outcomes of HF patients, especially time series data collected via remote monitoring. In this review, we sought to describe the basics of AI/ML algorithms with a focus on time series forecasting and the current state of AI/ML within the context of wearable technology in HF, followed by a discussion of the present limitations, including data integration, privacy, and challenges specific to AI/ML application within healthcare.", "This case study shows how an 8-year-old boy with autism and mild intellectual disability underwent positive psychological development in terms of play, social communication, and mentalization during a year and a half of group-based therapy using COMSI\u00ae-(COMmunication and Social Interaction). This eclectic treatment has a relational approach and is based on developmental psychology, knowledge of autism, and the impact of nature and animals on human health. The change in the child was been studied using both quantitative and qualitative methods. His general intellectual capacity was measured using the Wechler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, and his Mentalization Ability/Theory of Mind was assessed using three tests: Eva and Anna, Hiding the fruit and Kiki and the cat. Throughout the study period, change was documented with the help of the therapists' process notes and the parents' descriptions. The results show that support for the child comes from three different sources: nature, animals, and the therapists. Animals and nature form the basis for episodes of coordinated attention in conversation and play with therapists. The therapists' approach used sensitivity and compliance with the child's needs and focus of interest.", "Breast cancer is one of the most widely recognized diseases after skin cancer. Though it can occur in all kinds of people, it is undeniably more common in women. Several analytical techniques, such as Breast MRI, X-ray, Thermography, Mammograms, Ultrasound, etc., are utilized to identify it. In this study, artificial intelligence was used to rapidly detect breast cancer by analyzing ultrasound images from the Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset (BUSI), which consists of three categories: Benign, Malignant, and Normal. The relevant dataset comprises grayscale and masked ultrasound images of diagnosed patients. Validation tests were accomplished for quantitative outcomes utilizing the exhibition measures for each procedure. The proposed framework is discovered to be effective, substantiating outcomes with only raw image evaluation giving a 78.97% test accuracy and masked image evaluation giving 81.02% test precision, which could decrease human errors in the determination cycle. Additionally, our described framework accomplishes higher accuracy after using multi-headed CNN with two processed datasets based on masked and original images, where the accuracy hopped up to 92.31% (\u00b12) with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss of 0.05. This work primarily contributes to identifying the usefulness of multi-headed CNN when working with two different types of data inputs. Finally, a web interface has been made to make this model usable for non-technical personals.", "In the post-epidemic era, there is an endless supply of epidemic prevention products that cover a wide range of public areas. The introduction of such products has eased the tense pattern of virus proliferation in the context of the epidemic, and effectively demonstrated the initiatives implemented by the Chinese people in response to the outbreak. This paper therefore begins with the study of contactless epidemic prevention products, which appear in a form that meets the needs of contemporary society and offers a new mode of living to it. It enriches the measures for epidemic prevention and control. By obtaining satisfaction ratings from the user community, the performance of such products can be understood in time to provide a substantial basis for the subsequent upgrading and optimization or transformation of such products. This study uses the KJ method and questionnaires to construct an index system for contactless epidemic prevention products, grasp users' needs for epidemic prevention products in real time, classify and identify such products, and select such products as epidemic prevention smart security gates, medical delivery robots, infrared handheld thermometers, thermographic body temperature screening, contactless inductive lift buttons, and contactless medical vending machines. The questionnaire was designed with four dimensions: safety, intelligence, aesthetics and economy. A sample size of 262 was collected through the distribution of questionnaires. We used AHP and entropy weighting methods for the comprehensive evaluation; AHP basically tells us how satisfied most users are with this type of product. The use of the entropy weighting method can achieve objectivity in the weighting process. Combining the two approaches helps to improve the scientific nature of the weighting of the evaluation indexes for contactless and epidemic-proof products. It is clear from the AHP analysis that, firstly, there are differences in the perceptions of the performance of this type of product between different age groups. Secondly, the user group rated the perceived performance of the product presented as high (Bn>0.200), which users can subjectively and directly perceive. Next, the perceived future sustainable economic development of this product category is low (Bn\u22640.200), and users place low importance on its economic aspects as an objective additional condition. The entropy method of analysis shows that, under reasonable government control of the market for intelligent products, the safety, intelligence and aesthetic effects of these products are significant (Cm\u22640.100); further, the economic presentation of these products has yet to be optimized and upgraded (Cm>0.100).", "The risk of coal mine accidents rises significantly with mining depth, making it urgent for accident prevention to be supported by both scientific analysis and advanced technologies. Hence, a comprehensive grasp of the research progress and differences in hotspots of coal mine accidents in China serves as a guide to find the shortcomings of studies in the field, promote the effectiveness of coal mine disaster management, and enhance the prevention and control ability of coal mine accidents. This paper analyzes Chinese and foreign literature based on data mining algorithms (LSI + Apriori), and the findings indicate that: (1) 99% of the available achievements are published in Chinese or English-language journals, with the research history conforming to the stage of Chinese coal industry development, which is characterized by \"statistical description, risk evaluation, mechanism research, and intelligent reasoning\". (2) Chinese authors are the primary contributors that lead and contribute to the continued development of coal mine accident research in China globally. Over 81% of the authors and over 60% of the new authors annually are from China. (3) The emphasis of the Chinese and English studies is different. Specifically, the Chinese studies focus on the analysis of accident patterns and causes at the macroscale, while the English studies concentrate on the occupational injuries of miners at the small-scale and the mechanism of typical coal mine disasters (gas and coal spontaneous combustion). (4) The research process in Chinese is generally later than that in English due to the joint influence of the target audience, industrial policy, and scientific research evaluation system. After 2018, the Chinese studies focus significantly on AI technology in deep mining regarding accident rules, regional variation analysis, risk monitoring and early warning, as well as knowledge intelligence services, while the hotspots of English studies remain unchanged. Furthermore, both Chinese and English studies around 2019 focus on \"public opinion\", with Chinese ones focusing on serving the government to guide the correct direction of public opinion while English studies focus on critical research of news authenticity and China's safety strategy.", "Semantic communication is not focused on improving the accuracy of transmitted symbols, but is concerned with expressing the expected meaning that the symbol sequence exactly carries. However, the measurement of semantic messages and their corresponding codebook generation are still open issues. Expansion, which integrates simple things into a complex system and even generates intelligence, is truly consistent with the evolution of the human language system. We apply this idea to the semantic communication system, quantifying semantic transmission by symbol sequences and investigating the semantic information system in a similar way as Shannon's method for digital communication systems. This work is the first to discuss semantic expansion and knowledge collision in the semantic information framework. Some important theoretical results are presented, including the relationship between semantic expansion and the transmission information rate. We believe such a semantic information framework may provide a new paradigm for semantic communications, and semantic expansion and knowledge collision will be the cornerstone of semantic information theory.", "Artificial intelligence has recently been widely used in computational imaging. The deep neural network (DNN) improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the retrieved images, whose quality is otherwise corrupted due to the low sampling ratio or noisy environments. This work proposes a new computational imaging scheme based on the sequence transduction mechanism with the transformer network. The simulation database assists the network in achieving signal translation ability. The experimental single-pixel detector's signal will be 'translated' into a 2D image in an end-to-end manner. High-quality images with no background noise can be retrieved at a sampling ratio as low as 2%. The illumination patterns can be either well-designed speckle patterns for sub-Nyquist imaging or random speckle patterns. Moreover, our method is robust to noise interference. This translation mechanism opens a new direction for DNN-assisted ghost imaging and can be used in various computational imaging scenarios.", "This study aimed to analyze the existing literature on how artificial intelligence is being used to support the identification of cephalometric landmarks. The systematic analysis of literature was carried out by performing an extensive search in PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Scopus, and Science Direct databases. Articles published in the last ten years were selected after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 17 full-text articles were systematically appraised. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (CHSRI) and Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS) were adopted for quality analysis of the included studies. The artificial intelligence systems were mainly based on deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the included studies. The majority of the studies proposed that AI-based automatic cephalometric analyses provide clinically acceptable diagnostic performance. They have worked remarkably well, with accuracy and precision similar to the trained orthodontist. Moreover, they can simplify cephalometric analysis and provide a quick outcome in practice. Therefore, they are of great benefit to orthodontists, as with these systems they can perform tasks more efficiently.", "Due to the booming development of computer vision technology and artificial intelligence algorithms, it has become more feasible to implement artificial rearing of animals in real production scenarios. Improving the accuracy of day-age detection of chickens is one of the examples and is of great importance for chicken rearing. This paper focuses on the problem of classifying the age of chickens within 100 days. Due to the huge amount of data and the different computing power of different devices in practical application scenarios, it is important to maximize the computing power of edge computing devices without sacrificing accuracy. This paper proposes a high-precision federated learning-based model that can be applied to edge computing scenarios. In order to accommodate different computing power in different scenarios, this paper proposes a dual-ended adaptive federated learning framework; in order to adapt to low computing power scenarios, this paper performs lightweighting operations on the mainstream model; and in order to verify the effectiveness of the model, this paper conducts a number of targeted experiments. Compared with AlexNet, VGG, ResNet and GoogLeNet, this model improves the classification accuracy to 96.1%, which is 14.4% better than the baseline model and improves the Recall and Precision by 14.8% and 14.2%, respectively. In addition, by lightening the network, our methods reduce the inference latency and transmission latency by 24.4 ms and 10.5 ms, respectively. Finally, this model is deployed in a real-world application and an application is developed based on the wechat SDK.", "This study aims to investigate the core cognitive factors that affect reading and math performance of children of the grades 1-6 in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China, as well as the differences between children with dyslexia and mathematical disabilities (MD). Therefore, this study mainly evaluated the Cattell Horn Carroll (CHC) cognitive factors for 427 Chinese children and explored the core cognitive factors that affect Chinese children's reading and math performance. Students with dyslexia (n = 34), students with mathematics learning disabilities (n = 34), and 34 normal children were randomly selected as the control group. In order to explore the differences in cognitive development, we analyzed the differences among the three groups (Dyslexia, mathematical learning disabilities (MD), and normal children). The results revealed the following: (1) almost all cognitive ability factors in this study are significantly related to students' reading and mathematical achievements. (2) the core cognitive factors for predicting Chinese dyslexia students are crystallized intelligence, auditory processing and working memory. Executive function, spatial relationship and working memory are the core cognitive factors to predict Chinese children's mathematical achievements. (3) in addition, there are differences in cognitive deficits between disabled Chinese children in reading and math, among which those with reading deficits have extensive auditory processing deficits; while children with mathematic deficits have worse executive function. Recommendations were made based on these findings.", "COVID-19 was first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan. There have been reports of thousands of illnesses and hundreds of deaths in almost every region of the world. Medical images, when combined with cutting-edge technology such as artificial intelligence, have the potential to improve the efficiency of the public health system and deliver faster and more reliable findings in the detection of COVID-19. The process of developing the COVID-19 diagnostic system begins with image accusation and proceeds via preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. According to literature review, several attempts to develop taxonomies for COVID-19 detection using image processing methods have been introduced. However, most of these adhere to a standard category that exclusively considers classification methods. Therefore, in this study a new taxonomy for the early stages of COVID-19 detection is proposed. It attempts to offer a full grasp of image processing in COVID-19 while considering all phases required prior to classification. The survey concludes with a discussion of outstanding concerns and future directions.", "Consistent annotation of data is a prerequisite for the successful training and testing of artificial intelligence-based decision support systems in radiology. This can be obtained by standardizing terminology when annotating diagnostic images. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the annotation consistency among radiologists when using a novel diagnostic labeling scheme for chest X-rays. Six radiologists with experience ranging from one to sixteen years, annotated a set of 100 fully anonymized chest X-rays. The blinded radiologists annotated on two separate occasions. Statistical analyses were done using Randolph's kappa and PABAK, and the proportions of specific agreements were calculated. Fair-to-excellent agreement was found for all labels among the annotators (Randolph's Kappa, 0.40-0.99). The PABAK ranged from 0.12 to 1 for the two-reader inter-rater agreement and 0.26 to 1 for the intra-rater agreement. Descriptive and broad labels achieved the highest proportion of positive agreement in both the inter- and intra-reader analyses. Annotating findings with specific, interpretive labels were found to be difficult for less experienced radiologists. Annotating images with descriptive labels may increase agreement between radiologists with different experience levels compared to annotation with interpretive labels.", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is growing more prevalent worldwide. Although non-invasive diagnostic approaches such as conventional ultrasonography and clinical scoring systems have been proposed as alternatives to liver biopsy, their efficacy has been called into doubt. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now combined with traditional diagnostic processes to improve the performance of non-invasive approaches.\nThis study explores how well various AI methods function and perform on ultrasound (US) images to diagnose and quantify non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nA systematic review was conducted to achieve this objective. Five science bibliographic databases were searched, including PubMed, Association for Computing Machinery ACM Digital Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Only peer-reviewed English articles, conferences, theses, and book chapters were included. Data from studies were synthesized using narrative methodologies per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria.\nForty-nine studies were included in the systematic review. According to the qualitative analysis, AI significantly enhanced the diagnosis of NAFLD, Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), and liver fibrosis. In addition, modalities, image acquisition, feature extraction and selection, data management, and classifiers were assessed and compared in terms of performance measures (i.e., accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity).\nAI-supported systems show potential performance increases in detecting and quantifying steatosis, NASH, and liver fibrosis in NAFLD patients. Before real-world implementation, prospective studies with direct comparisons of AI-assisted modalities and conventional techniques are necessary.", "The ability to precisely monitor the intracellular temperature directly contributes to the essential understanding of biological metabolism, intracellular signaling, thermogenesis, and respiration. The intracellular heat generation and its measurement can also assist in the prediction of the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. However, intracellular thermometry without altering the biochemical reactions and cellular membrane damage is challenging, requiring appropriately biocompatible, nontoxic, and efficient biosensors. Bright, photostable, and functionalized fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) have emerged as excellent probes for intracellular thermometry and magnetometry with the spatial resolution on a nanometer scale. The temperature and magnetic field-dependent luminescence of naturally occurring defects in diamonds are key to high-sensitivity biosensing applications. Alterations in the surface chemistry of FNDs and conjugation with polymer, metallic, and magnetic nanoparticles have opened vast possibilities for drug delivery, diagnosis, nanomedicine, and magnetic hyperthermia. This study covers some recently reported research focusing on intracellular thermometry, magnetic sensing, and emerging applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in biomedical imaging. We extend the application of FNDs as biosensors toward disease diagnosis by using intracellular, stationary, and time-dependent information. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning (ML) and AI algorithms for developing biosensors can revolutionize any future outbreak.", "Detecting safety signals attributed to a drug in scientific literature is a fundamental issue in pharmacovigilance. The constant increase in the volume of publications requires the automation of this tedious task, in order to find and extract relevant articles from the pack. This task is critical, as serious Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) still account for a large number of hospital admissions each year.\nThe aim of this study is to develop an augmented intelligence methodology for automatically identifying relevant publications mentioning an established link between a Drug and a Serious Adverse Event, according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) definition of seriousness.\nThe proposed pipeline, called LiSA (for Literature Search Application), is based on three independent deep learning models supporting a precise detection of safety signals in the biomedical literature. By combining a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithms and a modular architecture, the pipeline achieves a precision of 0.81 and a recall of 0.89 at sentences level in articles extracted from PubMed (either abstract or full-text). We also measured that by using LiSA, a medical reviewer increases by a factor of 2.5 the number of relevant documents it can collect and evaluate compared to a simple keyword search. In the interest of re-usability, emphasis was placed on building a modular pipeline allowing the insertion of other NLP modules to enrich the results provided by the system, and extend it to other use cases. In addition, a lightweight visualization tool was developed to analyze and monitor safety signal results.\nOverall, the generic pipeline and the visualization tool proposed in this article allows for efficient and accurate monitoring of serious adverse drug reactions from the literature and can easily be adapted to similar pharmacovigilance use cases. To facilitate reproducibility and benefit other research studies, we also shared a first benchmark dataset for Serious Adverse Drug Events detection.", "Osteosarcoma is one of the aggressive bone tumors with numerous histologic patterns. Histopathological inspection is a crucial criterion in the medical diagnosis of Osteosarcoma. Due to the advancement of computing power and hardware technology, pathological image analysis system based on artificial intelligence (AI) were more commonly used. But classifying many intricate pathology images by hand will be challenging for pathologists. The lack of labeling data makes the system difficult to build and costly. This article designs a Honey Badger Optimization with Deep Learning based Automated Osteosarcoma Classification (HBODL-AOC) model. The HBODL-AOC technique's goal is to identify osteosarcoma's existence using medical images. In the presented HBODL-AOC technique, image preprocessing is initially performed by contrast enhancement technique. For feature extraction, the HBODL-AOC technique employs a deep convolutional neural network-based Mobile networks (MobileNet) model with an Adam optimizer for hyperparameter tuning. Finally, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approach is implemented for the HBO (Honey Badger Optimization) algorithm can tune osteosarcoma classification and the membership function (MF). To demonstrate the enhanced classification performance of the HBODL-AOC approach, a sequence of simulations was performed. The extensive simulation analysis portrayed the improved performance of the HBODL-AOC technique over existing DL models.", "The quantitative prediction of the SYNTAX score for cardiovascular artery disease patients using the inverse problem algorithm (IPA) technique in artificial intelligence was explored in this study. A 29-term semi-empirical formula was defined according to seven risk factors: (1) age, (2) mean arterial pressure, (3) body surface area, (4) pre-prandial blood glucose, (5) low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, (6) Troponin I, and (7) C-reactive protein. Then, the formula was computed via the STATISTICA 7.0 program to obtain a compromised solution for a 405-patient dataset with a specific loss function [actual-predicted]2 as low as 3.177, whereas 0.0 implies a 100% match between the prediction and observation via \"the lower, the better\" principle. The IPA technique first created a data matrix [405 \u00d7 29] from the included patients' data and then attempted to derive a compromised solution of the column matrix of 29-term coefficients [29 \u00d7 1]. The correlation coefficient, r2, of the regression line for the actual versus predicted SYNTAX score was 0.8958, showing a high coincidence among the dataset. The follow-up verification based on another 105 patients' data from the same group also had a high correlation coefficient of r2 = 0.8304. Nevertheless, the verified group's low derived average AT (agreement) (ATavg = 0.308 \u00b1 0.193) also revealed a slight deviation between the theoretical prediction from the STATISTICA 7.0 program and the grades assigned by clinical cardiologists or interventionists. The predicted SYNTAX scores were compared with earlier reported findings based on a single-factor statistical analysis or scanned images obtained by sonography or cardiac catheterization. Cardiologists can obtain the SYNTAX score from the semi-empirical formula for an instant referral before performing a cardiac examination.", "Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the United States (US), the overall 5-year relative survival rate for pancreatic cancer during the 2012-2018 period was 11.5%. However, the cancer stage at diagnosis strongly influences relative survival in these patients. Per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) statistics for 2012-2018, the 5-year relative survival rate for patients with localized disease was 43.9%, while it was 3.1% for patients with distant metastasis. The poor survival rates are primarily due to the late development of clinical signs and symptoms. Hence, early diagnosis is critical in improving treatment outcomes. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained immense popularity in gastroenterology. AI-assisted endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) models have been touted as a breakthrough in the early detection of pancreatic cancer. These models may also accurately differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis, which mimics pancreatic cancer on radiological imaging. In this review, we detail the application of AI-assisted EUS models for pancreatic cancer detection. We also highlight the utility of AI-assisted EUS models in differentiating pancreatic cancer from radiological mimickers. Furthermore, we discuss the current limitations and future applications of AI technology in EUS for pancreatic cancers.", "The prevalence of anxiety among university students is increasing, resulting in the negative impact on their academic and social (behavioral and emotional) development. In order for students to have competitive academic performance, the cognitive function should be strengthened by detecting and handling anxiety. Over a period of 6 weeks, this study examined how to detect anxiety and how Mano Shakti Yoga (MSY) helps reduce anxiety. Relying on cardiac signals, this study follows an integrated detection-estimation-reduction framework for anxiety using the Intelligent Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) and MSY. IIoMT is the integration of Internet of Medical Things (wearable smart belt) and machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and AdaBoost (AB)). Sixty-six eligible students were selected as experiencing anxiety detected based on the results of self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) questionnaire and a smart belt. Then, the students were divided randomly into two groups: experimental and control. The experimental group followed an MSY intervention for one hour twice a week, while the control group followed their own daily routine. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the data obtained from the smart belt. MSY is an alternative improvement for the immune system that helps reduce anxiety. All the results illustrate that the experimental group reduced anxiety with a significant (p < 0.05) difference in group \u00d7 time interaction compared to the control group. The intelligent techniques achieved maximum accuracy of 80% on using RF algorithm. Thus, students can practice MSY and concentrate on their objectives by improving their intelligence, attention, and memory.", "Patient misidentification is a preventable issue that contributes to medical errors. When patients are confused with each other, they can be given the wrong medication or unneeded surgeries. Unconscious, juvenile, and mentally impaired patients represent particular areas of concern, due to their potential inability to confirm their identity or the possibility that they may inadvertently respond to an incorrect patient name (in the case of juveniles and the mentally impaired). This paper evaluates the use of patient vital sign data, within an enabling artificial intelligence (AI) framework, for the purposes of patient identification. The AI technique utilized is both explainable (meaning that its decision-making process is human understandable) and defensible (meaning that its decision-making pathways cannot be altered, just optimized). It is used to identify patients based on standard vital sign data. Analysis is presented on the efficacy of doing this, for the purposes of catching misidentification and preventing error.", "To optimize artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to integrate Scheimpflug-based corneal tomography and biomechanics to enhance ectasia detection.\nMulticenter cross-sectional case-control retrospective study.\nA total of 3886 unoperated eyes from 3412 patients had Pentacam and Corvis ST (Oculus Optikger\u00e4te GmbH) examinations. The database included 1 eye randomly selected from 1680 normal patients (N) and from 1181 \"bilateral\" keratoconus (KC) patients, along with 551 normal topography eyes from patients with very asymmetric ectasia (VAE-NT), and their 474 unoperated ectatic (VAE-E) eyes. The current TBIv1 (tomographic-biomechanical index) was tested, and an optimized AI algorithm was developed for augmenting accuracy.\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the TBIv1 for discriminating clinical ectasia (KC and VAE-E) was 0.999 (98.5% sensitivity; 98.6% specificity [cutoff: 0.5]), and for VAE-NT, 0.899 (76% sensitivity; 89.1% specificity [cutoff: 0.29]). A novel random forest algorithm (TBIv2), developed with 18 features in 156 trees using 10-fold cross-validation, had a significantly higher AUC (0.945; DeLong, P < .0001) for detecting VAE-NT (84.4% sensitivity and 90.1% specificity; cutoff: 0.43; DeLong, P < .0001) and a similar AUC for clinical ectasia (0.999; DeLong, P\u00a0=\u00a0.818; 98.7% sensitivity; 99.2% specificity [cutoff: 0.8]). Considering all cases, the TBIv2 had a higher AUC (0.985) than TBIv1 (0.974; DeLong, P < .0001).\nAI optimization to integrate Scheimpflug-based corneal tomography and biomechanical assessments augments accuracy for ectasia detection, characterizing ectasia susceptibility in the diverse VAE-NT group. Some patients with VAE may have true unilateral ectasia. Machine learning considering additional data, including epithelial thickness or other parameters from multimodal refractive imaging, will continuously enhance accuracy. NOTE: Publication of this article is sponsored by the American Ophthalmological Society.", "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major cause of the withdrawal of pre-marketed drugs, typically attributed to oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, disrupted bile acid homeostasis, and innate immune-related inflammation. DILI can be divided into intrinsic and idiosyncratic DILI with cholestatic liver injury as an important manifestation. The diagnosis of DILI remains a challenge today and relies on clinical judgment and knowledge of the insulting agent. Early prediction of hepatotoxicity is an important but still unfulfilled component of drug development. In response, in silico modeling has shown good potential to fill the missing puzzle. Computer algorithms, with machine learning and artificial intelligence as a representative, can be established to initiate a reaction on the given condition to predict DILI. DILIsym is a mechanistic approach that integrates physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling with the mechanisms of hepatoxicity and has gained increasing popularity for DILI prediction. This article reviews existing in silico approaches utilized to predict DILI risks in clinical medication and provides an overview of the underlying principles and related practical applications.", "The conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are based on a set-point control approach that only considers the temperature of the environment without reflecting the thermophysiological status of the occupant. This approach not only fails to fully satisfy individual thermal preferences, but it also makes an HVAC operation energy-inefficient. One possible solution is to control the indoor thermal condition based on an accurate prediction of the occupant's thermal comfort to prevent any unnecessary energy consumption. Here, we present an artificial intelligence (AI) wearable sensor-based human-in-the-loop HVAC control system that is operated on a real-time basis reflecting the thermophysiological condition of the occupant to automatically improve their thermal comfort while reducing the energy consumption of the building. The wristband-type, AI-based, three-point wearable temperature sensor offers excellent thermal comfort prediction accuracy (93.9%), enabling a human-centric HVAC control operation. A proof-of-concept demonstration of closed human-in-the-loop HVAC control using the AI-enabled wearable sensor system confirms both the accuracy of the thermal comfort prediction and the energy-efficiency of this approach, demonstrating its potential as a new solution that improves the occupant's thermal comfort and provides building energy savings.", "Complex pathological diseases, such as cancer, infection, and Alzheimer's, need to be targeted by multipronged curative. Various omics technologies, with a high rate of data generation, demand artificial intelligence to translate these data into druggable targets. In this study, 82 marine venomous animal species were retrieved, and 3505 cryptic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) were identified in their toxins. A total of 279 safe peptides were further analyzed for antimicrobial, anticancer, and immunomodulatory characteristics. Protease-resistant CPPs with endosomal-escape ability in Hydrophis hardwickii, nuclear-localizing peptides in Scorpaena plumieri, and mitochondrial-targeting peptides from Synanceia horrida were suitable for compartmental drug delivery. A broad-spectrum S. horrida-derived antimicrobial peptide with a high binding-affinity to bacterial membranes was an antigen-presenting cell (APC) stimulator that primes cytokine release and na\u00efve T-cell maturation simultaneously. While antibiofilm and wound-healing peptides were detected in Synanceia verrucosa, APC epitopes as universal adjuvants for antiviral vaccination were in Pterois volitans and Conus monile. Conus pennaceus-derived anticancer peptides showed antiangiogenic and IL-2-inducing properties with moderate BBB-permeation and were defined to be a tumor-homing peptide (THP) with the ability to inhibit programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1). Isoforms of RGD-containing peptides with innate antiangiogenic characteristics were in Conus tessulatus for tumor targeting. Inhibitors of neuropilin-1 in C. pennaceus are proposed for imaging probes or therapeutic delivery. A Conus betulinus cryptic peptide, with BBB-permeation, mitochondrial-targeting, and antioxidant capacity, was a stimulator of anti-inflammatory cytokines and non-inducer of proinflammation proposed for Alzheimer's. Conclusively, we have considered the dynamic interaction of cells, their microenvironment, and proportional-orchestrating-host- immune pathways by multi-target-directed CPPs resembling single-molecule polypharmacology. This strategy might fill the therapeutic gap in complex resistant disorders and increase the candidates' clinical-translation chance.", "Emergency Radiology is a unique branch of imaging, as rapidity in the diagnosis and management of different pathologies is essential to saving patients' lives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many potential applications in emergency radiology: firstly, image acquisition can be facilitated by reducing acquisition times through automatic positioning and minimizing artifacts with AI-based reconstruction systems to optimize image quality, even in critical patients; secondly, it enables an efficient workflow (AI algorithms integrated with RIS-PACS workflow), by analyzing the characteristics and images of patients, detecting high-priority examinations and patients with emergent critical findings. Different machine and deep learning algorithms have been trained for the automated detection of different types of emergency disorders (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, bone fractures, pneumonia), to help radiologists to detect relevant findings. AI-based smart reporting, summarizing patients' clinical data, and analyzing the grading of the imaging abnormalities, can provide an objective indicator of the disease's severity, resulting in quick and optimized treatment planning. In this review, we provide an overview of the different AI tools available in emergency radiology, to keep radiologists up to date on the current technological evolution in this field.", "There are different fundamental diagnostic strategies for patients with ectatic corneal diseases (ECDs): screening, confirmation of the diagnosis, classification of the type of ECD, severity staging, prognostic assessment, and clinical follow-up. The conscious application of such strategies enables individualized treatments. The need for improved diagnostics of ECD is related to the advent of therapeutic refractive procedures that are considered prior to keratoplasty. Among such less invasive procedures, we include corneal crosslinking, customized ablations, and intracorneal ring segment implantation. Besides the paradigm shift in managing patients with ECD, enhancing the sensitivity to detect very mild forms of disease, and characterizing the inherent susceptibility for ectasia progression, became relevant for identifying patients at higher risk for progressive iatrogenic ectasia after laser vision correction (LVC). Moreover, the hypothesis that mild keratoconus is a risk factor for delivering a baby with Down's syndrome potentially augments the relevance of the diagnostics of ECD. Multimodal refractive imaging involves different technologies, including Placido-disk corneal topography, Scheimpflug 3-D tomography, segmental or layered tomography with layered epithelial thickness using OCT (optical coherence tomography), and digital very high-frequency ultrasound (VHF-US), and ocular wavefront. Corneal biomechanical assessments and genetic and molecular biology tests have translated to clinical measurements. Artificial intelligence allows for the integration of a plethora of clinical data and has proven its relevance in facilitating clinical decisions, allowing personalized or individualized treatments.", "Intelligence, like creativity and wisdom, has an attitudinal component as well as an ability-based one. The attitudinal component is at least as important as the ability-based one. Theories of intelligence, in ignoring the attitudinal component of intelligence, have failed to account fully or accurately for why so many people who have relatively high levels of intelligence as an ability fail fully to deploy their ability, especially toward positive ends. The article reviews the need to view intelligence as comprising an attitude as well as an ability, and surveys reasons why people's lack of an intelligent attitude hinders their deployment of intelligence. Suggestions are made for how things could change in a positive way.", "Cervical cancer is regularly diagnosed in women all over the world. This cancer is the seventh most frequent cancer globally and the fourth most prevalent cancer among women. Automated and higher accuracy of cervical cancer classification methods are needed for the early diagnosis of cancer. In addition, this study has proved that routine Pap smears could enhance clinical outcomes by facilitating the early diagnosis of cervical cancer. Liquid-based cytology (LBC)/Pap smears for advanced cervical screening is a highly effective precancerous cell detection technology based on cell image analysis, where cells are classed as normal or abnormal. Computer-aided systems in medical imaging have benefited greatly from extraordinary developments in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. However, resource and computational cost constraints prevent the widespread use of AI-based automation-assisted cervical cancer screening systems. Hence, this paper reviewed the related studies that have been done by previous researchers related to the automation of cervical cancer classification based on machine learning. The objective of this study is to systematically review and analyses the current research on the classification of the cervical using machine learning. The literature that has been reviewed is indexed by Scopus and Web of Science. As a result, for the published paper access until October 2022, this study assessed past approaches for cervical cell classification based on machine learning applications.", "A framework that extracts oncological outcomes from large-scale databases using artificial intelligence (AI) is not well established. Thus, we aimed to develop AI models to extract outcomes in patients with lung cancer using unstructured text data from electronic health records of multiple hospitals.\nWe constructed AI models (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT], Na\u00efve Bayes, and Longformer) for tumor evaluation using the University of Miyazaki Hospital (UMH) database. This data included both structured and unstructured data from progress notes, radiology reports, and discharge summaries. The BERT model was applied to the Life Data Initiative (LDI) data\u00a0set of six hospitals. Study outcomes included the performance of AI models and time to progression of disease (TTP) for each line of treatment based on the treatment response extracted by AI models.\nFor the UMH data\u00a0set, the BERT model exhibited higher precision accuracy compared to the Na\u00efve Bayes or the Longformer models, respectively (precision [0.42 vs. 0.47 or 0.22], recall [0.63 vs. 0.46 or 0.33] and F1 scores [0.50 vs. 0.46 or 0.27]). When this BERT model was applied to LDI data, prediction accuracy remained quite similar. The Kaplan-Meier plots of TTP (months) showed similar trends for the first (median 14.9 [95% confidence interval 11.5, 21.1] and 16.8 [12.6, 21.8]), the second (7.8 [6.7, 10.7] and 7.8 [6.7, 10.7]), and the later lines of treatment for the predicted data by the BERT model and the manually curated data.\nWe developed AI models to extract treatment responses in patients with lung cancer using a large EHR database; however, the model requires further improvement.\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) to derive health outcomes from large electronic health records is not well established. Thus, we built three different AI models: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Na\u00efve Bayes, and Longformer to serve this purpose. Initially, we developed these models based on data from the University of Miyazaki Hospital (UMH) and later improved them using the Life Data Initiative (LDI) data\u00a0set of six hospitals. The performance of the BERT model was better than the other two, and it showed similar results when it was applied to the LDI data\u00a0set. The Kaplan\u2013Meier plots of time to progression of disease for the predicted data by the BERT model showed similar trends to those for the manually curated data. In summary, we developed an AI model to extract health outcomes using a large electronic health database in this study; however, the performance of the AI model could be improved using more training data.", "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary hepatic neoplasm. Thanks to recent advances in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there is potential to improve detection, segmentation, discrimination from HCC mimics, and monitoring of therapeutic response. Radiomics, artificial intelligence (AI), and derived tools have already been applied in other areas of diagnostic imaging with promising results. In this review, we briefly discuss the current clinical applications of radiomics and AI in the detection, segmentation, and management of HCC. Moreover, we investigate their potential to reach a more accurate diagnosis of HCC and to guide proper treatment planning.", "Creativity incorporates both domain-general and domain-specific ideas. While previous studies have explored the impact of emotional intelligence (EI) on creativity in both domains, a consensus has not been reached, and the mechanism is currently unclear. In the present study, we examined which aspect of creativity EI was most strongly associated with in a group of undergraduates. Moreover, we explored the moderated mediation effect between EI and domain-specific creativity. In Study 1, 532 undergraduates completed questionnaires measuring EI, convergent and divergent creative thinking, and creative achievement. The results revealed that the most reliable positive correlations were between EI and domain-specific creativity. In Study 2, 926 undergraduates completed measurements of EI, resilience, gratitude, and creative achievement. The results revealed that resilience mediates the relationship between EI and creative achievement. Furthermore, gratitude moderated the indirect effect of EI on creative achievement through resilience. The indirect effect of EI on creative achievement was stronger for high-gratitude individuals than for low-gratitude individuals. This orientation and other results are discussed. Overall, our findings add further nuance to the relationship between EI and creativity in different domains. This study serves as a basis for other contributions aligned with these concepts.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential for facilitating the detection and classification of tumors. In patients with non-small cell lung cancer, distinguishing between the most common subtypes, adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), is crucial for the development of an effective treatment plan. This task, however, may still present challenges in clinical routine. We propose a two-modality, AI-based classification algorithm to detect and subtype tumor areas, which combines information from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data and digital microscopy whole slide images (WSIs) of lung tissue sections. The method consists of first detecting areas with high tumor cell content by performing a segmentation of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E-stained) WSIs, and subsequently classifying the tumor areas based on the corresponding MALDI MSI data. We trained the algorithm on six tissue microarrays (TMAs) with tumor samples from N = 232 patients and used 14 additional whole sections for validation and model selection. Classification accuracy was evaluated on a test dataset with another 16 whole sections. The algorithm accurately detected and classified tumor areas, yielding a test accuracy of 94.7% on spectrum level, and correctly classified 15 of 16 test sections. When an additional quality control criterion was introduced, a 100% test accuracy was achieved on sections that passed the quality control (14 of 16). The presented method provides a step further towards the inclusion of AI and MALDI MSI data into clinical routine and has the potential to reduce the pathologist's work load. A careful analysis of the results revealed specific challenges to be considered when training neural networks on data from lung cancer tissue.", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a polygenic multifactorial neurodegenerative disease that, after decades of research and development, is still without a cure. There are some symptomatic treatments to manage the psychological symptoms but none of these drugs can halt disease progression. Additionally, over the last few years, many anti-AD drugs failed in late stages of clinical trials and many hypotheses surfaced to explain these failures, including the lack of clear understanding of disease pathways and processes. Recently, different epigenetic factors have been implicated in AD pathogenesis; thus, they could serve as promising AD diagnostic biomarkers. Additionally, network biology approaches have been suggested as effective tools to study AD on the systems level and discover multi-target-directed ligands as novel treatments for AD. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology to provide a better understanding of disease pathogenesis hypotheses and decipher the role of genetic and epigenetic factors in disease development and progression. We also provide an overview of disease biomarkers and drug targets and suggest network biology approaches as new tools for identifying novel biomarkers and drugs. We also posit that the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to mining Alzheimer's disease multi-omics data will facilitate drug and biomarker discovery efforts and lead to effective individualized anti-Alzheimer treatments.", "The popularity of health concepts and the wave of digitalization have driven the innovation of sensors in the medical field. Such continual development has made sensors progress in the direction of safety, flexibility, and intelligence for continuous monitoring of vital signs, which holds considerable promise for changing the way humans live and even treat diseases. To this end, flexible wearable devices with high performance, such as high sensitivity, high stability, and excellent biodegradability, have attracted strong interest from scientists. Herein, a review of flexible wearable sensors for temperature, heart rate, human motion, respiratory rate, glucose, and pH is highlighted. In addition, engineering issues are also presented, focusing on material selection, sensor fabrication, and power supply. Finally, potential challenges facing current technology and future directions of wearable sensors are also discussed.", "Kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) imaging is a radiological examination with a low cost, low radiation, and convenience. Although emergency room clinicians can arrange KUB images easily as a first-line examination for patients with suspicious urolithiasis, interpreting the KUB images correctly is difficult for inexperienced clinicians. Obtaining a formal radiology report immediately after a KUB imaging examination can also be challenging. Recently, artificial-intelligence-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to help clinicians who are not experts make correct diagnoses for further treatment more effectively. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a CAD system for KUB imaging based on a deep learning model designed to help first-line emergency room clinicians diagnose urolithiasis accurately. A total of 355 KUB images were retrospectively collected from 104 patients who were diagnosed with urolithiasis at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Then, we trained a deep learning model with a ResNet architecture to classify KUB images in terms of the presence or absence of kidney stones with this dataset of pre-processed images. Finally, we tuned the parameters and tested the model experimentally. The results show that the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-measure of the model were 0.977, 0.953, 1, and 0.976 on the validation set and 0.982, 0.964, 1, and 0.982 on the testing set, respectively. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the proposed model performed well compared to the existing CNN-based methods and was able to detect urolithiasis in KUB images successfully. We expect the proposed approach to help emergency room clinicians make accurate diagnoses and reduce unnecessary radiation exposure from computed tomography (CT) scans, along with the associated medical costs.", "Infertility is a global health issue affecting women and men of reproductive age with increasing incidence worldwide, in part due to greater awareness and better diagnosis. Assisted reproduction technologies (ART) are considered the ultimate step in the treatment of infertility. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been progressively used in the many fields of medicine, integrating knowledge and computer science through machine learning algorithms. AI has the potential to improve infertility diagnosis and ART outcomes estimated as pregnancy and/or live birth rate, especially with recurrent ART failure. A broad-ranging review has been conducted, focusing on clinical AI applications up until September 2022, which could be estimated in terms of possible applications, such as ultrasound monitoring of folliculogenesis, endometrial receptivity, embryo selection based on quality and viability, and prediction of post implantation embryo development, in order to eliminate potential contributing risk factors. Oocyte morphology assessment is highly relevant in terms of successful fertilization rate, as well as during oocyte freezing for fertility preservation, and substantially valuable in oocyte donation cycles. AI has great implications in the assessment of male infertility, with computerised semen analysis systems already in use and a broad spectrum of possible AI-based applications in environmental and lifestyle evaluation to predict semen quality. In addition, considerable progress has been made in terms of harnessing AI in cases of idiopathic infertility, to improve the stratification of infertile/fertile couples based on their biological and clinical signatures. With AI as a very powerful tool of the future, our review is meant to summarise current AI applications and investigations in contemporary reproduction medicine, mainly focusing on the nonsurgical aspects of it; in addition, the authors have briefly explored the frames of reference and guiding principles for the definition and implementation of legal, regulatory, and ethical standards for AI in healthcare.", "Spray drying (SD) is one of the most important thermal processes used to produce different powders and encapsulated materials. During this process, quality degradation might happen. The main objective of applying optimization methods in SD processes is maximizing the final nutritional quality of the product besides sensory attributes. Optimization regarding economic issues might be also performed. Applying optimization approaches in line with mathematical models to predict product changes during thermal processes such as SD can be a promising method to enhance the quality of final products. In this review, the application of the response surface methodology (RSM), as the most widely used approach, is introduced along with other optimization techniques such as factorial, Taguchi, and some artificial intelligence-based methods like artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic algorithms (GA), Fuzzy logic, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Also, probabilistic methods such as Monte Carlo are briefly introduced. Some recent case studies regarding the implementation of these methods in SD processes are also exemplified and discussed.\nThe quality of spray dried products can be enhanced using different optimization methods.Drying air temperature and flow rate, feed flow rate, wall material concentration, and atomization pressure are the most significant adjustable input variables in the optimization of the spray drying process.Product yield, moisture content, water activity, hygroscopicity, solubility, total color differences, particle size, bulk density, glass transition temperature, encapsulation efficiency, and viability (about probiotics) are the most important output variables in the optimization of the spray drying process.Response surface methodology (RSM), is the most widely used approach in spray drying optimization.Artificial intelligence-based methods like artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic algorithms (GA), Fuzzy logic, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have a great potential in spray drying optimization.Probabilistic methods such as Monte Carlo are able to predict and optimize the spray drying process.", "This special issue 'Emergent properties of biological networks' celebrates the growing and vibrant international community of researchers working on questions in the area of cellular and tissue-level biological physics. Networks are a common way to represent biological systems ranging from sub-cellular protein signaling to the entire ecosystem, elucidating the crosstalk among different interacting entities. Recent advances in highthroughput cellular measurement technologies, cost-effective next-generation sequencing, and development of new computational methods (including algorithmic, statistical, graph theoretical concepts, machine learning, and many artificial intelligence-based techniques) have truly revolutionized the investigation of biological networks by uncovering and predicting emergent phenomena that have great implications in both biology and medicine.", "Artificial intelligence (AI), a field of research in which computers are applied to mimic humans, is continuously expanding and influencing many aspects of our lives. From electric cars to search motors, AI helps us manage our daily lives by simplifying functions and activities that would be more complex otherwise. Even in the medical field, and specifically in oncology, many studies in recent years have highlighted the possible helping role that AI could play in clinical and therapeutic patient management. In specific contexts, clinical decisions are supported by \"intelligent\" machines and the development of specific softwares that assist the specialist in the management of the oncology patient. Melanoma, a highly heterogeneous disease influenced by several genetic and environmental factors, to date is still difficult to manage clinically in its advanced stages. Therapies often fail, due to the establishment of intrinsic or secondary resistance, making clinical decisions complex. In this sense, although much work still needs to be conducted, numerous evidence shows that AI (through the processing of large available data) could positively influence the management of the patient with advanced melanoma, helping the clinician in the most favorable therapeutic choice and avoiding unnecessary treatments that are sure to fail. In this review, the most recent applications of AI in melanoma will be described, focusing especially on the possible finding of this field in the management of drug treatments.", "We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) technique to identify epileptic discharges (spikes) in pediatric scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs). We built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to automatically classify steep potential images into spikes and background activity. For the CNN model' training and validation, we examined 100 children with spikes in EEGs and another 100 without spikes. A different group of 20 children with spikes and 20 without spikes were the actual test subjects. All subjects were \u2265 3 to < 18 years old. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the analysis were >0.97 when referential and combination EEG montages were used, and < 0.97 with a bipolar montage. The correct classification of background activity in individual patients was significantly better with a referential montage than with a bipolar montage (p=0.0107). Receiver operating characteristic curves yielded an area under the curve > 0.99, indicating high performance of the classification method. EEG patterns that interfered with correct classification included vertex sharp transients, sleep spindles, alpha rhythm, and low-amplitude ill-formed spikes in a run. Our results demonstrate that AI is a promising tool for automatically interpreting pediatric EEGs. Some avenues for improving the technique were also indicated by our findings.", "Antibiotic residues in breast milk can have an impact on the intestinal flora and health of babies. Amoxicillin, as one of the most used antibiotics, affects the abundance of some intestinal bacteria. In this study, we developed a convenient and rapid process that used a combination of colorimetric methods and artificial intelligence image preprocessing, and back propagation-artificial neural network (BP-ANN) analysis to detect amoxicillin in breast milk. The colorimetric method derived from the reaction of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was coupled to aptamers (ssDNA) with different concentrations of amoxicillin to produce different color results. The color image was captured by a portable image acquisition device, and image preprocessing was implemented in three steps: segmentation, filtering, and cropping. We decided on a range of detection from 0 \u00b5M to 3.9 \u00b5M based on the physiological concentration of amoxicillin in breast milk and the detection effect. The segmentation and filtering steps were conducted by Hough circle detection and Gaussian filtering, respectively. The segmented results were analyzed by linear regression and BP-ANN, and good linear correlations between the colorimetric image value and concentration of target amoxicillin were obtained. The R2 and MSE of the training set were 0.9551 and 0.0696, respectively, and those of the test set were 0.9276 and 0.1142, respectively. In prepared breast milk sample detection, the recoveries were 111.00%, 98.00%, and 100.20%, and RSDs were 6.42%, 4.27%, and 1.11%. The result suggests that the colorimetric process combined with artificial intelligence image preprocessing and BP-ANN provides an accurate, rapid, and convenient way to achieve the detection of amoxicillin in breast milk.", "The estimation of concrete characteristics through artificial intelligence techniques is come out to be an effective way in the construction sector in terms of time and cost conservation. The manufacturing of Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC) is based on combining numerous ingredients, resulting in a very complex composite in fresh and hardened form. The more ingredients, along with more possible combinations, properties and relative mix proportioning, results in difficult prediction of UHPC behavior. The main aim of this research is the development of Machine Learning (ML) models to predict UHPC flowability and compressive strength. Accordingly, sophisticated and effective artificial intelligence approaches are employed in the current study. For this purpose, an individual ML model named Decision Tree (DT) and ensembled ML algorithms called Bootstrap Aggregating (BA) and Gradient Boosting (GB) are applied. Statistical analyses like; Determination Coefficient (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are also employed to evaluate algorithms' performance. It is concluded that the GB approach appropriately forecasts the UHPC flowability and compressive strength. The higher R2 value, i.e., 0.94 and 0.95 for compressive and flowability, respectively, of the DT technique and lesser error values, have higher precision than other considered algorithms with lower R2 values. SHAP analysis reveals that limestone powder content and curing time have the highest SHAP values for UHPC flowability and compressive strength, respectively. The outcomes of this research study would benefit the scholars of the construction industry to quickly and effectively determine the flowability and compressive strength of UHPC.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key player in modern healthcare, especially in the pharmaceutical industry for the development of new drugs and vaccine candidates [...].", "In diagnostic medicine, the true disease status of a patient is often represented on an ordinal scale-for example, cancer stage (0, I, II, III, or IV) or coronary artery disease severity measured using the Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) scale (none, minimal, mild, moderate, severe, or occluded). With advances in quantitation of diagnostic images and in artificial intelligence (AI), both supervised and unsupervised algorithms are being developed to help physicians correctly grade disease. Most of the diagnostic accuracy literature deals with binary disease status (disease present or absent); however, tests diagnosing ordinal-scaled diseases should not be reduced to a binary status just to simplify diagnostic accuracy testing. In this paper, we propose different characterizations of ordinal-scale accuracy for different clinical use scenarios, along with methods for comparing tests. In the simplest scenario, just the proportion of correct grades is considered; other scenarios address the magnitude and direction of misgrading; and at the other extreme, a weighted accuracy measure with weights based on the relative costs of different types of misgrading is presented. The various scenarios are illustrated using a coronary artery disease example where the accuracy of AI algorithms in providing patients with the correct CAD-RADS grade is assessed.", "The main purpose of modern intelligence tests has been to predict individual differences in academic performance, first of children, then adolescents, and later extending to adults. From the earliest Binet-Simon scales to current times, most one-on-one omnibus intelligence assessments include both process subtests (e.g., memory, reasoning) and content subtests (e.g., vocabulary, information). As somewhat parallel developments, intelligence theorists have argued about the primacy of the process components or the content components reflecting intelligence, with many modern researchers proposing that process constructs like working memory are the fundamental determinant of individual differences in intelligence. To address whether there is an adequate basis for re-configuring intelligence assessments from content or mixed content and process measures to all-process measures, the question to be answered in this paper is whether intellectual process assessments are more or less valid predictors of academic success, in comparison to content measures. A brief review of the history of intelligence assessment is provided with respect to these issues, and a number of problems and limitations of process measures is discussed. In the final analysis, there is insufficient justification for using process-only measures to the exclusion of content measures, and the limited data available point to the idea that content-dominated measures are more highly predictive of academic success than are process measures.", "Background:\u00a0The study's purpose was to identify associations between mental health risk, suicide attempts, and family function. \u00a0 Methods:\u00a0A correlational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study was carried out in a group of adolescents in the last grade of secondary school to establish the association between mental health risk, suicide attempt, and family functionality. The instruments used were the self-report questionnaire, the suicide risk assessment scale, and the family APGAR. Data analysis was performed using the artificial intelligence algorithm (gower clustering).\u00a0 Results:\u00a0246 adolescents responded to the three instruments, which made it possible to select those with correlations of sensitive interest and, based on these, an intervention plan. Psychological distress was found in 28%, psychotic symptoms in 85%, and problematic alcohol use in 9%. Good family functioning was identified in 34% and some type of family dysfunction in 66%. In terms of suicide risk, there was a low suicide risk of 74%, 24% medium risk, and 2% high risk. It could be shown that there is a correlation in a group of 15% of the respondents.\u00a0 Conclusions:\u00a0The risk of suffering mental health deterioration and the suicide risk, during this pandemic period, seems to be related to family functionality.", "Introduction: As they are satisfied with life, nurses who demonstrate spiritual intelligence and well-being at work are tremendous assets to an organisation. This study aimed to determine the mediating effect of spiritual intelligence on the well-being and life satisfaction of nurses in the context of COVID-19. Methods: This research employed a cross-sectional study design. It was conducted in the Hail region of Saudi Arabia. The participants were government hospital nurses who were chosen using a multi-stage sampling method. A total of 1121 (75% response rate) nurses participated in the study. Data gathering was conducted from July to September 2022. Results: The life satisfaction level of the participants was deemed positive. Their well-being was better (10/15), and they rated high in spiritual intelligence (90/120). Life satisfaction had a strong association with well-being (r = 0.640, p < 0.001), but a weak association with spiritual intelligence (r = 0.391, p < 0.001). In comparison, well-being had a moderate association with spiritual intelligence (r = 0.551, p < 0.001). The direct effect of well-being on spiritual intelligence was positive and significant (\u03b2 = 0.7817, p < 0.0001), and that of spiritual intelligence on life satisfaction was positive and significant (\u03b2 = 0.1082, p = 0.0257). The direct effect of well-being on life satisfaction was also positive and significant (\u03b2 = 1.5985, p < 0.0001). Conversely, well-being had an indirect impact on life satisfaction (\u03b2 = 0.0846), and this effect was significant. Overall, the impact of well-being on life satisfaction was positive and significant (\u03b2 = 1.6831, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The nurses in this study were deemed satisfied, to have better well-being, and better spiritual intelligence. Life satisfaction has a strong association with well-being but a weak one with spiritual intelligence, while well-being has a moderate association with spiritual intelligence. Overall, spiritual intelligence was found to have a mediating effect on the relationship between well-being and life satisfaction. These findings suggest that an increase in spiritual growth can serve as the foundation for people to live better and more integrated lives.", "Markers used in everyday clinical practice cannot distinguish between the permanent impairment of renal function. Sodium and potassium values and their interdependence are key parameters in addition to volemia for the assessment of cardiorenal balance. The aim of this study was to investigate volemia and electrolyte status from a clinical cardiorenal viewpoint under consideration of renal function utilizing artificial intelligence. In this paper, an analysis of five variables: B-type natriuretic peptide, sodium, potassium, ejection fraction, EPI creatinine-cystatin C, was performed using an algorithm based on the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system. B-type natriuretic peptide had the greatest influence on the ejection fraction. It has been shown that values of both Na+ and K+ lead to deterioration of the condition and vital endangerment of patients. To identify the risk of occurrence, the model identifies a prognostic biomarker by random regression from the total data set. The predictions obtained from this model can help optimize preventative strategies and intensive monitoring for patients identified as at risk for electrolyte disturbance and hypervolemia. This approach may be superior to the traditional diagnostic approach due to its contribution to more accurate and rapid diagnostic interpretation and better planning of further patient treatment.", "Familial high-risk (FHR) studies examining longitudinal associations between neurocognition and psychotic experiences are currently lacking. We hypothesized neurocognitive impairments at age 7 to be associated with increased risk of psychotic experiences from age 7 to 11 in children at familial high risk of schizophrenia (FHR-SZ) or bipolar disorder (FHR-BP) and population-based controls (PBC), and further, impaired functioning in some neurocognitive functions to be associated with greater risk of psychotic experiences in children at FHR-SZ or FHR-BP relative to PBC.\nNeurocognition was assessed at age 7 (early childhood) and psychotic experiences from age 7 to 11 (middle childhood) in 449 children from the Danish High Risk and Resilience Study. The neurocognitive assessment covered intelligence, processing speed, attention, visuospatial and verbal memory, working memory, and set-shifting. Psychotic experiences were assessed through face-to-face interviews with the primary caregiver and the child.\nSet-shifting impairments at age 7 were associated with greater risk of psychotic experiences from age 7 to 11 in children at FHR-SZ. Children at FHR-BP and PBC showed no differential associations. Working memory and visuospatial memory impairments were related to increased risk of psychotic experiences across the cohort. However, adjusting for concurrent psychopathology attenuated these findings.\nEarly childhood neurocognitive impairments are risk markers of middle childhood psychotic experiences, of which impaired set-shifting appears to further increase the risk of psychotic experiences in children at FHR-SZ. More research is needed to examine longitudinal associations between neurocognitive impairments and psychotic experiences in FHR samples.", "Physical ergonomics has established itself as a valid strategy for monitoring potential disorders related, for example, to working activities. Recently, in the field of physical ergonomics, several studies have also shown potential for improvement in experimental methods of ergonomic analysis, through the combined use of artificial intelligence, and wearable sensors. In this regard, this review intends to provide a first account of the investigations carried out using these combined methods, considering the period up to 2021. The method that combines the information obtained on the worker through physical sensors (IMU, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) or biopotential sensors (EMG, EEG, EKG/ECG), with the analysis through artificial intelligence systems (machine learning or deep learning), offers interesting perspectives from both diagnostic, prognostic, and preventive points of view. In particular, the signals, obtained from wearable sensors for the recognition and categorization of the postural and biomechanical load of the worker, can be processed to formulate interesting algorithms for applications in the preventive field (especially with respect to musculoskeletal disorders), and with high statistical power. For Ergonomics, but also for Occupational Medicine, these applications improve the knowledge of the limits of the human organism, helping in the definition of sustainability thresholds, and in the ergonomic design of environments, tools, and work organization. The growth prospects for this research area are the refinement of the procedures for the detection and processing of signals; the expansion of the study to assisted working methods (assistive robots, exoskeletons), and to categories of workers suffering from pathologies or disabilities; as well as the development of risk assessment systems that exceed those currently used in ergonomics in precision and agility.", "With its robust ability to integrate and learn from large sets of clinical data, artificial intelligence (AI) can now play a role in diagnosis,\u00a0clinical decision making, and personalized medicine. It is probably the natural progression of traditional statistical techniques. Currently, there are many unmet needs in nephrology and, more particularly, in the kidney transplantation (KT) field. The complexity and increase in the amount of data, and the multitude of nephrology registries worldwide have enabled the explosive use of AI within the field. Nephrologists in many countries are already at the center of experiments and advances in this cutting-edge technology and our aim is to generalize the use of AI among nephrologists worldwide. In this paper, we provide an overview of AI from a medical perspective. We cover the core concepts of AI relevant to the practicing nephrologist in a consistent and simple way to help them get started, and we discuss the technical challenges. Finally, we focus on the KT field: the unmet needs and the potential role that AI can play to fill these gaps, then we summarize the published KT-related studies, including predictive factors used in each study, which will allow researchers to quickly focus on the most relevant issues.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to solve several issues affecting COVID-19 diagnosis. This systematic review research explores the impact of AI in early COVID-19 screening, detection, and diagnosis. A comprehensive survey of AI in the COVID-19 literature, mainly in the context of screening and diagnosis, was observed by applying the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data sources for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were retrieved from google scholar, web of science, Scopus, and PubMed, with target keywords relating to AI in COVID-19 screening and diagnosis. After a comprehensive review of these studies, the results found that AI contributed immensely to improving COVID-19 screening and diagnosis. Some proposed AI models were shown to have comparable (sometimes even better) clinical decision outcomes, compared to experienced radiologists in the screening/diagnosing of COVID-19. Additionally, AI has the capacity to reduce physician work burdens and fatigue and reduce the problems of several false positives, associated with the RT-PCR test (with lower sensitivity of 60-70%) and medical imaging analysis. Even though AI was found to be timesaving and cost-effective, with less clinical errors, it works optimally under the supervision of a physician or other specialists.", "To develop and validate a deep learning-based screening tool for the early diagnosis of scoliosis using chest radiographs with a semi-supervised generative adversarial network (GAN).\nUsing a semi-supervised learning framework with a GAN, a screening tool for diagnosing scoliosis was developed and validated through the chest PA radiographs of patients at two different tertiary hospitals.

In particular, AI models for improving the efficiency of the image acquisition process and the quality of reconstructed images are being actively developed by the MR research community. AI is expected to further reduce acquisition times in various MRI protocols used in clinical practice when compared to current parallel imaging techniques. Additionally, AI can help with tasks such as planning, parameter optimization, artifact reduction, and quality assessment. Furthermore, AI is being actively applied to automate MR image analysis such as image registration, segmentation, and object detection. For this reason, it is important to consider the effects of protocols or devices in MR image analysis.

Results show that China is the country with the highest number of publications (1115), accounting for 29% of the total; however, the most influential country in the field is the USA, with an h-index of 75. The Chinese Academy of Sciences publishes the largest number of papers (104) and plays a vital role in the collaboration network. The study also reveals that the IEEE Access is the most productive journal (195) in terms of the number of publications, and engineering is the most popular discipline (1526). The key theoretical foundation includes deep learning (293), big data (105), energy consumption (79), and reinforcement learning (40). The application of big data and AI in the field of energy focuses on smart grid, energy consumption, and renewable energy. Early research frontiers involve optimization and prediction of energy-related problems using the genetic algorithm and neural networks. Since 2013, energy big data have gained prominence. At present, machine learning, deep learning, and fog computing are frequently combined with energy saving. In the future, big data and AI will be utilized to promote the application of renewable energy and energy-saving renovation of buildings. These findings can help researchers understand the developmental trends and correctly grasp the research direction and method of the emerging interdisciplinary field.", "Gliomas are the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors. Gliomas carry a poor prognosis because of the tumor's resistance to radiation and chemotherapy leading to nearly universal recurrence. Recent advances in large-scale genomic research have allowed for the development of more targeted therapies to treat glioma. While precision medicine can target specific molecular features in glioma, targeted therapies are often not feasible due to the lack of actionable markers and the high cost of molecular testing. This review summarizes the clinically relevant molecular features in glioma and the current cost of care for glioma patients, focusing on the molecular markers and meaningful clinical features that are linked to clinical outcomes and have a realistic possibility of being measured, which is a promising direction for precision medicine using artificial intelligence approaches.", "To investigate the utility of combination of CD138/MUM1 dual-staining (DS) and artificial intelligence (AI) for plasma cell (PC) counting in the diagnosis of chronic endometritis (CE).\nTwo hundred ninety-eight infertile women underwent endometrial biopsy were included. In 100 women, three successive\u00a0sections were cut from each paraffin-embedded tissue block for CD138 immunohistochemical (IHC) single-staining (SS), MUM1 SS and CD138/MUM1 DS. The prevalence of CE and the sensitivity/specificity in the diagnosis of CE with different methods was studied. These sections diagnosed as CE with DS were collected to train artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic system. In other 198 women, their tissue sections stained with CD138/MUM1 DS were used to test the AI system in the diagnosis of CE.\nCD138/MUM1 DS revealed that the cell membranes and nuclei of PCs were simultaneously labelled by CD138 and MUM1, respectively. The positive rate of ECs identified by CD138/MUM1 DS (38%, 38/100) was lower than CD138 SS (52%, 52/100) and MUM1 SS (62%, 62/100) (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CD138/MUM1 DS in the diagnosis of ECs reached 100%. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rates of AI diagnostic system of ECs were 100%, 83.3% and 91.4%, respectively. The 17 cases over-diagnosed as EC with the AI were corrected quickly by pathologists reviewing these false PC pictures listed by the AI.\nThe combination of CD138/MUM1 DS and AI is a promising method to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CE diagnosis.", "In the medical field, artificial intelligence has been used in various ways with many developments. However, most artificial intelligence technologies are developed so that one model can perform only one task, which is a limitation in designing the complex reading process of doctors with artificial intelligence. Multi-task learning is an optimal way to overcome the limitations of single-task learning methods. Multi-task learning can create a model that is efficient and advantageous for generalization by simultaneously integrating various tasks into one model. This study investigated the concepts, types, and similar concepts as multi-task learning, and examined the status and future possibilities of multi-task learning in the medical research.\n\ucd5c\uadfc, \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\ub85c \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uba70 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\uc220\ub4e4\uc740 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub9cc\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \uc758\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc758 \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \ud310\ub3c5 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ud55c\uacc4\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba40\ud2f0 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud55c\uacc4\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \ubc29\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c\ub4e4\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubaa8\ub378\ub85c \ud559\uc2b5\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\uc5d0 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc885\uc124\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\ub150\uacfc \uc885\ub958, \uc720\uc0ac \uac1c\ub150 \ub4f1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc54c\uc544\ubcf4\uace0, \uc5f0\uad6c \uc0ac\ub840\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc758\ub8cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uba40\ud2f0 \ud0dc\uc2a4\ud06c \ub7ec\ub2dd\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9 \ud604\ud669\uacfc \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "(1) Background: Length of stay (LOS) has been suggested as a marker of the effectiveness of short-term care. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies could help monitor hospital stays. We developed an AI-based novel predictive LOS score for advanced-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients following cytoreductive surgery and refined factors significantly affecting LOS. (2) Methods: Machine learning and deep learning methods using artificial neural networks (ANN) were used together with conventional logistic regression to predict continuous and binary LOS outcomes for HGSOC patients. The models were evaluated in a post-hoc internal validation set and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of sophisticated LOS predictions. (3) Results: For binary LOS predictions at differential time points, the accuracy ranged between 70-98%. Feature selection identified surgical complexity, pre-surgery albumin, blood loss, operative time, bowel resection with stoma formation, and severe postoperative complications (CD3-5) as independent LOS predictors. For the GUI numerical LOS score, the ANN model was a good estimator for the standard deviation of the LOS distribution by \u00b1 two days. (4) Conclusions: We demonstrated the development and application of both quantitative and qualitative AI models to predict LOS in advanced-stage EOC patients following their cytoreduction. Accurate identification of potentially modifiable factors delaying hospital discharge can further inform services performing root cause analysis of LOS.", "Previous research has revealed vocational and academic difficulties in childhood cancer survivors, and explored impact of survivors' medical history and physical function on vocational and academic status. However, we often encounter survivors with similar diagnoses and late effects but different academic or employment statuses. This raises the question of what affects academic attainment and employment other than treatment or late effects. This study aimed to explore factors associated with childhood cancer survivors' employment status and academic achievement.\nComprehensive health check-up and questionnaire survey were conducted for 69 survivors who were over the age of 18 and participated in St. Luke's Lifetime cohort study. We obtained survivors' biological function using comprehensive health check-up, neurocognitive states, quality of life, transition readiness, and family function. We conducted univariate analysis (Mann-Whitney U tests or chi-square tests) to compare the differences between the regular workers/students and non-regular workers/unemployed groups. The variables with p-values <0.1 were used as independent variables multivariate logistic regression to explore predictors of employment status and academic attainment.\nResult of the univariate analysis, intelligence quotient, SF-8 PCS, transition readiness, family function were used for multivariate logistic regression as independent variables. The stepwise likelihood method was conducted; intelligence quotient (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20091.100; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.015-1.193; p\u2009=\u20090.021), transition readiness (OR\u2009=\u20090.612; 95% CI 0.396-0.974; p\u2009=\u20090.038), and family function (OR\u2009=\u20092.337; 95% CI 1.175-4.645; p\u2009=\u20090.015) were found to be associated with survivors' regular workers/students in the final regression model.\nLong-term follow-up of pediatric cancer survivors requires the provision of total care, which supports physical, psychological, and social functions to improve health, readiness for transition to self-management, and family functioning.", "Aurora Battery is a corresponding test of successful intelligence. This study aims to examine the factorial structure of the Chinese version of Aurora Battery and to investigate its internal consistency and validity, as well as to discover the developmental features of Chinese students. A total number of 2007 students were recruited from 13 schools across eastern, central, and western China, ranging from 4th to 8th grade (mean age = 12.29 years) and among them, 43.9% are girls. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the factorial structure. Among the tested models, a second-order factor model, in which the three ability factors serve as indicators of a general factor, provided an acceptable model fit to the data. Moreover, measurement invariance across gender and grades were supported, which suggests the mean scores of analytical, creative, and practical abilities are comparable in this research. The criterion-related validity analysis suggests that the battery and its three subscales have good criterion validity. The scale reliability analysis shows that the Cronbach's alpha and the McDonald's omega value of the whole test were .84 and .87, respectively, indicating the scale's internal reliability is good. For ability differences among grades, students' analytical and practical abilities increase across all grades, while creativity presents an upward trend from grade 4 to 6, followed by a downward trend from grade 6 to 7, and an increase from grade 7 to 8. Female students outperform male students on both analytical and creative ability, while with no obvious difference on practical abilities.", "This study aims to develop a cardiac arrest prediction model using deep learning (CAPD) algorithm and to validate the developed algorithm by evaluating the change in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patient prognosis according to the increase in scene time interval (STI).\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using smart advanced life support trial data collected by the National Emergency Center from January 2016 to December 2019. The smart advanced life support data were randomly partitioned into derivation and validation datasets. The performance of the CAPD model using the patient's age, sex, event witness, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), administration of epinephrine, initial shockable rhythm, prehospital defibrillation, provision of advanced life support, response time interval, and STI as prediction variables for prediction of a patient's prognosis was compared with conventional machine learning methods. After fixing other values of the input data, the changes in prognosis of the patient with respect to the increase in STI was observed.\nA total of 16,992 patients were included in this study. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for predicting prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and favorable neurological outcomes were 0.828 (95% confidence interval 0.826-0.830) and 0.907 (0.914-0.910), respectively. Our algorithm significantly outperformed other artificial intelligence algorithms and conventional methods. The neurological recovery rate was predicted to decrease to 1/3 of that at the beginning of cardiopulmonary resuscitation when the STI was 28 min, and the prehospital ROSC was predicted to decrease to 1/2 of its initial level when the STI was 30 min.\nThe CAPD exhibits potential and effectiveness in identifying patients with ROSC and favorable neurological outcomes for prehospital resuscitation.", "Over the last few years, dozens of healthcare surveys have shown a shortage of doctors and an alarming doctor-population ratio. With the motivation of assisting doctors and utilizing their time efficiently, automatic disease diagnosis using artificial intelligence is experiencing an ever-growing demand and popularity. Humans are known by the company they keep; similarly, symptoms also exhibit the association property, i.e., one symptom may strongly suggest another symptom's existence/non-existence, and their association provides crucial information about the suffering condition. The work investigates the role of symptom association in symptom investigation and disease diagnosis process. We propose and build a virtual assistant called Association guided Symptom Investigation and Diagnosis Assistant (A-SIDA) using hierarchical reinforcement learning. The proposed A-SIDDA converses with patients and extracts signs and symptoms as per patients' chief complaints and ongoing dialogue context. We infused association-based recommendations and critic into the assistant, which reinforces the assistant for conducting context-aware, symptom-association guided symptom investigation. Following the symptom investigation, the assistant diagnoses a disease based on the extracted signs and symptoms. The assistant then diagnoses a disease based on the extracted signs and symptoms. In addition to diagnosis accuracy, the relevance of inspected symptoms is critical to the usefulness of a diagnosis framework. We also propose a novel evaluation metric called Investigation Relevance Score (IReS), which measures the relevance of symptoms inspected during symptom investigation. The obtained improvements (Diagnosis success rate-5.36%, Dialogue length-1.16, Match rate-2.19%, Disease classifier-6.36%, IReS-0.3501, and Human score-0.66) over state-of-the-art methods firmly establish the crucial role of symptom association that gets uncovered by the virtual agent. Furthermore, we found that the association guided symptom investigation greatly increases human satisfaction, owing to its seamless topic (symptom) transition.", "Human-Building Interaction (HBI) is a convergent field that represents the growing complexities of the dynamic interplay between human experience and intelligence within built environments. This paper provides core definitions, research dimensions, and an overall vision for the future of HBI as developed through consensus among 25 interdisciplinary experts in a series of facilitated workshops. Three primary areas contribute to and require attention in HBI research: humans (human experiences, performance, and well-being), buildings (building design and operations), and technologies (sensing, inference, and awareness). Three critical interdisciplinary research domains intersect these areas: control systems and decision making, trust and collaboration, and modeling and simulation. Finally, at the core, it is vital for HBI research to center on and support equity, privacy, and sustainability. Compelling research questions are posed for each primary area, research domain, and core principle. State-of-the-art methods used in HBI studies are discussed, and examples of original research are offered to illustrate opportunities for the advancement of HBI research.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of medicine. Systems assessing chest radiographs, pathology slides, and early warning systems embedded in electronic health records (EHRs) are becoming ubiquitous in medical practice. Despite this, medical students have minimal exposure to the concepts necessary to utilize and evaluate AI systems, leaving them under prepared for future clinical practice. We must work quickly to bolster undergraduate medical education around AI to remedy this. In this commentary, we propose that medical educators treat AI as a critical component of medical practice that is introduced early and integrated with the other core components of medical school curricula. Equipping graduating medical students with this knowledge will ensure they have the skills to solve challenges arising at the confluence of AI and medicine.", "The concept of intelligence has been extensively studied, undergoing an evolution from a unitary concept to a more elaborate and complex multidimensional one. In addition, several research studies have focused their efforts for decades on the study of intelligence as a predictor of academic performance of students at different educational stages, being a stable and highly relevant predictor along with other variables such as executive functions, social context, culture or parental guardianship. Thus, the present study, based on a systematic review and meta-analysis, includes 27 studies with a total sample of 42,061 individuals. The main objective was to analyse the relationship between intelligence and academic performance using different predictive models that include moderating variables such as country of origin, type of intelligence, gender and age. The findings of this research highlight the significant, positive and moderate relationship between intelligence and academic performance (r = 0.367; p < 0.001), highlighting the predictive capacity on school performance when the type of intelligence (general and implicit; 35%) or the country of origin (45%) is taken as a moderating variable, with the explanatory models on age or sex not being significant. Therefore, it can be concluded that intelligence, in addition to being a good predictor of academic performance, is influenced depending on the type of intelligence or theoretical model taken as a reference, and also depending on the country or culture of origin.", "Growing evidence suggests that artificial intelligence tools could help radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from other types of viral (non-COVID-19) pneumonia. To test this hypothesis, an R-AI classifier capable of discriminating between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia was developed using CT chest scans of 1031 patients with positive swab for SARS-CoV-2 (n = 647) and other respiratory viruses (n = 384). The model was trained with 811 CT scans, while 220 CT scans (n = 151 COVID-19; n = 69 non-COVID-19) were used for independent validation. Four readers were enrolled to blindly evaluate the validation dataset using the CO-RADS score. A pandemic-like high suspicion scenario (CO-RADS 3 considered as COVID-19) and a low suspicion scenario (CO-RADS 3 considered as non-COVID-19) were simulated. Inter-reader agreement and performance metrics were calculated for human readers and R-AI classifier. The readers showed good agreement in assigning CO-RADS score (Gwet's AC2 = 0.71, p < 0.001). Considering human performance, accuracy = 78% and accuracy = 74% were obtained in the high and low suspicion scenarios, respectively, while the AI classifier achieved accuracy = 79% in distinguishing COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia on the independent validation dataset. The R-AI classifier performance was equivalent or superior to human readers in all comparisons. Therefore, a R-AI classifier may support human readers in the difficult task of distinguishing COVID-19 from other types of viral pneumonia on CT imaging.", "The smoking behaviour of patients following a cancer diagnosis is a critical risk factor for several physical diseases; it can increase the risk of second primary tumors and lower cancer treatment efficacy. Despite this, a great number of survivors continue to smoke after the diagnosis. This observational, cross-sectional on-line study aimed to assess the relationship between the impact of cancer diagnosis on survivors and their smoking behavior, and whether emotional intelligence and personality might mediate this relationship. Ninety-four Italian survivors completed a set of questionnaires: Big Five Inventory; Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence; Impact of Event Scale; Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale. The results obtained from the mediation analyses highlighted that the indirect effect on the relationship between the psychological impact of the diagnosis and smoking behaviors was partially mediated by neuroticism (Intrusion: 95% CI [0.00; 0.11]; Avoidance: 95% CI [0.00; 0.18]). Additionally, the data suggested that the relationship between the psychological impact of the diagnosis and smoking behaviors was partially mediated by the utilization of emotions dimension of emotional intelligence (Intrusion: 95% CI [0.00; 0.10]; Avoidance: 95% CI [0.00; 0.22]). Overall, this study suggests the importance of designing interventions to support smoking interruption based on the \"mapping\" of individual needs and emotional regulation strategies.", "Power output from the PV module changes continuously with time depending upon the climatic condition. This changes are most important in tropical area like Senegal due to the variation of the seasons (dry and rainy). Furthermore, different types of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm are presented in literature in order to get maximum output from the PV system. They can be summarized in two categories: classical and intelligent methods. The classical methods in no uniform weather condition are not efficient and an important loss of energy is showed. However, faced to this problematics like energy loss and no uniform weather conditions an Adaptative methods is used to optimize the PVs energy. In this study, two intelligent controllers based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are proposed to optimize the PVs production in non-uniform weather conditions and compared in order to show the most powerful model. For the ANN, the main challenge is to find the optimal neural in the hidden layer and in the paper, it is obtained using evaluator factor like mean squared error (MSE). These techniques using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are used for power optimization of a photovoltaic system are trained and validated with real data from a photovoltaic micro power plant in dry and rainy season installed at polytechnic high school of Dakar. The performances of the controllers to optimize the PVs power are evaluated during the dry and rainy seasons. Simulation results show that the ANFIS MPPT controller is more efficient and robust than ANN in non-uniform weather conditions. They have the ability of generalization and adaption to each meteorological conditions. These bullet summarize the applied methodology\u2022A real electrical characteristics of photovoltaic panel are used for learning and validation of the controllers.\u2022A comparative study of the methods in two different season is done.\u2022ANFIS gives best performance in weather conditions compared to the ANN.", "Artificial intelligence is of major interest to healthcare as a means to improve patient care.

However, measurement of WC is unstable and often missing from patient databases. Herein, we created Fibro-Scope V1.0.1 that has the same detection power as its predecessor, without the need to consider WC.\nTo build a new AI diagnostic system available for the global needs, data from 764 patients with NASH and bridging fibrosis (STELLAR-3) or compensated cirrhosis (STELLAR-4) that participated in two phase III trials were added to the Japanese data. Finally, the data of a total of 898 patients in the training and of 300 patients in the validation studies were analyzed, respectively.\nThe discrimination of F0-2 from F3,4 through Fibro-Scope V1.0.1 was characterized by a 99.8% sensitivity, a 99.6% specificity, a 99.8% positive predictive value, and a 99.6% negative predictive value in a training study with gray zone analysis; similar effectiveness was also revealed in the analysis without a gray zone. In the validation studies with and without gray zone analysis, high sensitivity and specificity were also identified. Fibro-Scope V1.0.1 exerted a diagnostic accuracy for F3,4 advanced fibrosis that was comparable to that of the original Fibro-Scope and delivered high (>\u200992%) sensitivity and specificity.\nFibro-Scope V1.0.1 can accurately diagnose F3,4 fibrosis without the need of WC.", "Since breast cancer deaths are mainly due to metastasis, predicting the risk that a primary tumor will develop metastasis after a first diagnosis is a central issue that could be addressed by artificial intelligence. To overcome the problem posed by limited availability of standardized datasets, algorithms should include biological insight.", "With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the development and implementation of digital food systems are becoming increasingly possible. There is tremendous interest in using different AI applications, such as machine learning models, natural language processing, and computer vision to improve food safety. Possible AI applications are broad and include, but are not limited to, (a) food safety risk prediction and monitoring as well as food safety optimization throughout the supply chain, (b) improved public health systems (e.g., by providing early warning of outbreaks and source attribution), and (c) detection, identification, and characterization of foodborne pathogens. However, AI technologies in food safety lag behind in commercial development because of obstacles such as limited data sharing and limited collaborative research and development efforts. Future actions should be directed toward applying data privacy protection methods, improving data standardization, and developing a collaborative ecosystem to drive innovations in AI applications to food safety.", "What was once considered a topic best avoided, managing heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has become the focus of many drug and device therapies. While the four pillars of guideline-directed medical therapies have successfully reduced heart failure hospitalizations, and some have even impacted cardiovascular mortality in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), patient-reported outcomes have emerged as important endpoints that merit greater emphasis in future studies. The prospect of an oral inotrope seems more probable now as targets for drug therapies have moved from neurohormonal modulation to intracellular mechanisms and direct cardiac myosin stimulation. While we have come a long way in safely providing durable mechanical circulatory support to patients with advanced HFrEF, several percutaneous device therapies have emerged, and many are under investigation. Biomarkers have shown promise in not only improving our ability to diagnose incident heart failure but also our potential to implicate specific pathophysiological pathways. The once-forgotten concept of discordance between pressure and volume, the forgotten splanchnic venous and lymphatic compartments, have all emerged as promising targets for diagnosing and treating heart failure in the not-so-distant future. The increase in heart failure-related cardiogenic shock (CS) has revived interest in defining optimal perfusion targets and designing RCTs in CS. Rapid developments in remote monitoring, telemedicine, and artificial intelligence promise to change the face of heart failure care. In this state-of-the-art review, we reminisce about the past, highlight the present, and predict what might be the future of HFrEF therapies.", "With the rapid development of the internet, the application of internet search data has been seen as a novel data source to offer timely infectious disease surveillance intelligence. Moreover, the advancements in internet search data, which include rich information at both space and time scales, enable investigators to sufficiently consider the spatiotemporal uncertainty, which can benefit researchers to better monitor infectious diseases and epidemics. In the present study, we present the necessary groundwork and critical appraisal of the use of internet search data and spatiotemporal analysis approaches in infectious disease surveillance by updating the current stage of knowledge on them. The study also provides future directions for researchers to investigate the combination of internet search data with the spatiotemporal analysis in infectious disease surveillance. Internet search data demonstrate a promising potential to offer timely epidemic intelligence, which can be seen as the prerequisite for improving infectious disease surveillance.", "Active pulmonary tuberculosis (ATB), which is more infectious and has a higher mortality rate compared with non-active pulmonary tuberculosis (non-ATB), needs to be diagnosed accurately and timely to prevent the tuberculosis from spreading and causing deaths. However, traditional differential diagnosis methods of active pulmonary tuberculosis involve bacteriological testing, sputum culturing and radiological images reading, which is time consuming and labour intensive. Therefore, an artificial intelligence model for ATB differential diagnosis would offer great assistance in clinical practice. In this study, computer tomography (CT) scans images and corresponding clinical information of 1160 ATB patients and 1131 patients with non-ATB were collected and divided into training, validation, and testing sets. A 3-dimension (3D) Nested UNet model was utilized to delineate lung field regions in the CT images, and three different pre-trained deep learning models including 3D VGG-16, 3D EfficientNet and 3D ResNet-50 were used for classification and differential diagnosis task. We also collected an external testing set with 100 ATB cases and 100 Non-ATB cases for further validation of the model. In the internal and external testing set, the 3D ResNet-50 model outperformed other models, reaching an AUC of 0.961 and 0.946, respectively. The 3D ResNet-50 model reached even higher levels of diagnostic accuracy than experienced radiologists, while the CT images reading and diagnosing speed was 10 times faster than human experts. The model was also capable of visualizing clinician interpretable lung lesion regions important for differential diagnosis, making it a powerful tool assisting ATB diagnosis. In conclusion, we developed an auxiliary tool to differentiate active and non-active pulmonary tuberculosis, which would have broad prospects in the bedside.", "Recent advances in cardiac MRI (CMR) capabilities have truly transformed its potential for deep phenotyping of the diseased heart. Long known for its unparalleled soft tissue contrast and excellent depiction of three-dimensional (3D) structure, CMR now boasts a range of unique capabilities for probing disease at the tissue and molecular level. We can look beyond coronary vessel blockages and detect vessel disease not visible on a structural level. We can assess if early fibrotic tissue is being laid down in between viable cardiac muscle cells. We can measure deformation of the heart wall to determine early presentation of stiffening. We can even assess how cardiomyocytes are utilizing energy, where abnormalities are often precursors to overt structural and functional deficits. Finally, with artificial intelligence gaining traction due to the high computing power available today, deep learning has proven itself a viable contender with traditional acceleration techniques for real-time CMR. In this review, we will survey five key emerging MRI techniques that have the potential to transform the CMR clinic and permit early detection and intervention. The emerging areas are: (1) imaging microvascular dysfunction, (2) imaging fibrosis, (3) imaging strain, (4) imaging early metabolic changes, and (5) deep learning for acceleration. Through a concerted effort to develop and translate these areas into the CMR clinic, we are committing ourselves to actualizing early diagnostics for the most intractable heart disease phenotypes.", "Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) is important for diagnosis of plasma cell disorders (PCDs). Manual analysis of IFE images is time-consuming and potentially subjective. An artificial intelligence (AI) system for automatic and accurate IFE image recognition is desirable.\nIn total, 12 703 expert-annotated IFE images (9182 from a new IFE imaging system and 3521 from an old one) were used to develop and test an AI system that was an ensemble of 3 deep neural networks. The model takes an IFE image as input and predicts the presence of 8 basic patterns (IgA-, IgA-, IgG-, IgG-, IgM-, IgM-, light chain and ) and their combinations. Score-based class activation maps (Score-CAMs) were used for visual explanation of the models prediction.\nThe AI model achieved an average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.82, 93.17, and 99.93, respectively, for detection of the 8 basic patterns, which outperformed 4 junior experts with 1 years experience and was comparable to a senior expert with 5 years experience. The Score-CAMs gave a reasonable visual explanation of the prediction by highlighting the target aligned regions in the bands and indicating potentially unreliable predictions. When trained with only the new system images, the models performance was still higher than junior experts on both the new and old IFE systems, with average accuracy of 99.91 and 99.81, respectively.\nOur AI system achieved human-level performance in automatic recognition of IFE images, with high explainability and generalizability. It has the potential to improve the efficiency and reliability of diagnosis of PCDs.", "Structured Medication Reviews (SMRs) are intended to help deliver the NHS Long Term Plan for medicines optimisation in people living with multiple long-term conditions and polypharmacy. It is challenging to gather the information needed for these reviews due to poor integration of health records across providers and there is little guidance on how to identify those patients most urgently requiring review.\nTo extract information from scattered clinical records on how health and medications change over time, apply interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to predict risks of poor outcomes and overlay this information on care records to inform SMRs. We will pilot this approach in primary care prescribing audit and feedback systems, and co-design future medicines optimisation decision support systems.\nDynAIRx will target potentially problematic polypharmacy in three key multimorbidity groups, namely, people with (a) mental and physical health problems, (b) four or more long-term conditions taking ten or more drugs and (c) older age and frailty. Structured clinical data will be drawn from integrated care records (general practice, hospital, and social care) covering an \u223c11m population supplemented with Natural Language Processing (NLP) of unstructured clinical text. AI systems will be trained to identify patterns of conditions, medications, tests, and clinical contacts preceding adverse events in order to identify individuals who might benefit most from an SMR.\nBy implementing and evaluating an AI-augmented visualisation of care records in an existing prescribing audit and feedback system we will create a learning system for medicines optimisation, co-designed throughout with end-users and patients.", "Publicly accessible benchmarks that allow for assessing and comparing model performances are important drivers of progress in artificial intelligence (AI). While recent advances in AI capabilities hold the potential to transform medical practice by assisting and augmenting the cognitive processes of healthcare professionals, the coverage of clinically relevant tasks by AI benchmarks is largely unclear. Furthermore, there is a lack of systematized meta-information that allows clinical AI researchers to quickly determine accessibility, scope, content and other characteristics of datasets and benchmark datasets relevant to the clinical domain. To address these issues, we curated and released a comprehensive catalogue of datasets and benchmarks pertaining to the broad domain of clinical and biomedical natural language processing (NLP), based on a systematic review of literature and. A total of 450 NLP datasets were manually systematized and annotated with rich metadata, such as targeted tasks, clinical applicability, data types, performance metrics, accessibility and licensing information, and availability of data splits. We then compared tasks covered by AI benchmark datasets with relevant tasks that medical practitioners reported as highly desirable targets for automation in a previous empirical study. Our analysis indicates that AI benchmarks of direct clinical relevance are scarce and fail to cover most work activities that clinicians want to see addressed. In particular, tasks associated with routine documentation and patient data administration workflows are not represented despite significant associated workloads. Thus, currently available AI benchmarks are improperly aligned with desired targets for AI automation in clinical settings, and novel benchmarks should be created to fill these gaps.", "There has been a surge in mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has prompted the increased use of digital platforms. However, there is little known about the mental health needs and behaviors of the global population during the pandemic. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap through the analysis of real-world data collected from users of a digital mental health app (Wysa) regarding their engagement patterns and behaviors, as shown by their usage of the service.\nThis study aims to (1) examine the relationship between mental health distress, digital health uptake, and COVID-19 case numbers; (2) evaluate engagement patterns with the app during the study period; and (3) examine the efficacy of the app in improving mental health outcomes for its users during the pandemic.\nThis study used a retrospective observational design. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the app's installations and emotional utterances were measured from March 2020 to October 2021 for the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and India and were mapped against COVID-19 case numbers and their peaks. The engagement of the users from this period (N=4541) with the Wysa app was compared to that of equivalent samples of users from a pre-COVID-19 period (1000 iterations). The efficacy was assessed for users who completed pre-post assessments for symptoms of depression (n=2061) and anxiety (n=1995) on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) test measures, respectively.\nOur findings demonstrate a significant positive correlation between the increase in the number of installs of the Wysa mental health app and the peaks of COVID-19 case numbers in the United Kingdom (P=.02) and India (P<.001). Findings indicate that users (N=4541) during the COVID period had a significantly higher engagement than the samples from the pre-COVID period, with a medium to large effect size for 80% of these 1000 iterative samples, as observed on the Mann-Whitney test. The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 pre-post assessments indicated statistically significant improvement with a medium effect size (PHQ-9: P=.57; GAD-7: P=.56).\nThis study demonstrates that emotional distress increased substantially during the pandemic, prompting the increased uptake of an artificial intelligence-led mental health app (Wysa), and also offers evidence that the Wysa app could support its users and its usage could result in a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression. This study also highlights the importance of contextualizing interventions and suggests that digital health interventions can provide large populations with scalable and evidence-based support for mental health care.", "Working memory (WM) refers to the temporary storage and manipulation of information. Short-term memory storage can be divided into separate subsystems for verbal information and visual information. We explored the capacity of visual WM in patients with temporal lobe glioma.\nIn this study, we assessed 30 patients with temporal lobe glioma and 30 healthy controls (HCs) using a method that combined memory tests with visual WM tasks (digital span task, spatial capacity N-back task, and emotional N-back task).\nThe results revealed that groups did not differ in terms of demographics, estimated intelligence, and level of psyc distress. For visual WM tasks, statistically significant differences were not found on the 1-back tasks and forward versions of simple span tasks between the temporal patient (TP) group and the HC group. Analysis of correct responses of the experimental tasks suggested that the TP group was significantly different from the HC group in the 2-back tasks and backward versions of simple span tasks. For reaction times, spatial capacity 2-back task and emotional 2-back task showed the TP group was significantly different from the HC group.\nThese findings revealed that visual WM scores of temporal glioma patients were lower than HCs, and hence, the temporal lobe may be a certain neuroanatomical structure in the WM network.", "Concurrent with the global outbreak of COVID-19, the race began among scientists to generate effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. In this regard, advanced technology such as nanotechnology, cell-based therapies, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, nerve stimulation and artificial intelligence (AI) are attractive because they can offer new solutions for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Nanotechnology can design rapid and specific tests with high sensitivity for detecting infection and synthases new drugs and vaccines based on nanomaterials to directly deliver the intended antiviral agent to the desired site in the body and also provide new surfaces that do not allow virus adhesion. Mesenchymal stem cells and exosomes secreted from them apply in regenerative medicine and regulate inflammatory responses. Cell therapy and tissue engineering are combined to repair or substitute damaged tissues or cells. Tissue engineering using biomaterials, cells, and signaling molecules can develop new therapeutic and diagnostic platforms and help scientists fight viral diseases. Nerve stimulation technology can augment body's natural ability to modulate the inflammatory response and inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines and consequently suppress cytokine storm. People can access free online health counseling services through AI and it helps very fast for screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. This study is aimed first to give brief information about COVID-19 and the epidemiology of the disease. After that, we highlight important developments in the field of advanced technologies relevant to the prevention, detection, and treatment of the current pandemic.", "At least 60 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per day is recommended for physical and mental health of adolescents. Schools are one of the most suitable places for promoting students' health as it is a place where vigorous physical activity occurs. However, the physical activity of students is threatened because schools are closed worldwide owing to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in 2019. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the physical fitness changes in 27,782 Korean adolescents during the pandemic and present alternative education and health policies to the school.\nWe included 29,882 middle school students (age: 13-15 years; males: 14,941, females: 12,841) in Korea from 2019 to 2021 . Participants' physical fitness at school was measured using the physical activity promotion system (PAPS) manual developed to measure students' physical fitness. Physical fitness variables included body mass index (BMI), 20 m shuttle run, handgrip strength, sit-and-reach, and 50 m run.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the BMI and cardiorespiratory endurance of Korean middle school students. Specifically, male students' BMI increased, while body composition, cardiorespiratory endurance, and grip strength decreased significantly. Female students showed significant decreases in BMI and sit-and-reach test scores. It is clear that the physical fitness level of adolescents decreased by a greater degree after the COVID-19 pandemic than before, and the decrease in the physical fitness level of male students was noticeable. Therefore, a lesson strategy should be prepared that considers the contents and methods of physical education classes to improve the physical fitness level of male and female adolescents.\nFitness-based classes suitable for online methods should be urgently added as alternative physical education classes to prepare for the second COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, it is necessary to create an environment in which physical activity is a possibility in physical education classes, in any situation using artificial intelligence and virtual reality.", "In the era of 5G and the Internet of things (IoTs), various human-computer interaction systems based on the integration of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and IoTs technologies demonstrate the feasibility of sustainable and self-powered functional systems. The rapid development of intelligent applications of IoTs based on TENGs mainly relies on supplying the harvested mechanical energy from surroundings and implementing active sensing, which have greatly changed the way of human production and daily life. This review mainly introduced the TENG applications in multidiscipline scenarios of IoTs, including smart agriculture, smart industry, smart city, emergency monitoring, and machine learning-assisted artificial intelligence applications. The challenges and future research directions of TENG toward IoTs have also been proposed. The extensive developments and applications of TENG will push forward the IoTs into an energy autonomy fashion.", "Our goal was to evaluate a previously validated artificial intelligence-augmented electrocardiography (AI-ECG) screening tool for left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) in patients undergoing high-sensitivity-cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT).\nRetrospective application of AI-ECG for LVSD in emergency department (ED) patients undergoing hs-cTnT. AI-ECG scores (0-1) for probability of LVSD (left ventricular ejection fraction \u2264 35%) were obtained. An AI-ECG score \u22650.256 indicates a positive screen. The primary endpoint was a composite of post-discharge major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) at two years follow-up. Among 1977 patients, 248 (13%) had a positive AI-ECG. When compared with patients with a negative AI-ECG, those with a positive AI-ECG had a higher risk for MACE [48 vs. 21%, P < 0.0001, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.75]. This was largely because of a higher rate of deaths (32 vs. 14%, P < 0.0001; adjusted HR 1.26, 95% 0.95-1.66) and heart failure hospitalizations (26 vs. 6.1%, P < 0.001; adjusted HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.25-2.45). Together, hs-cTnT and AI-ECG resulted in the following MACE rates and adjusted HRs: hs-cTnT < 99th percentile and negative AI-ECG: 116/1176 (11%; reference), hs-cTnT < 99th percentile and positive AI-ECG: 28/107 (26%; adjusted HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01-2.36), hs-cTnT > 99th percentile and negative AI-ECG: 233/553 (42%; adjusted HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.66, 2.70), and hs-cTnT > 99th percentile and positive AI-ECG: 91/141 (65%; adjusted HR 2.83, 95% CI 2.06, 3.87).\nAmong ED patients evaluated with hs-cTnT, a positive AI-ECG for LVSD identifies patients at high risk for MACE. The conjoint use of hs-cTnT and AI-ECG facilitates risk stratification.", "Maimuna Majumder (she/they) is an assistant professor in the Computational Health Informatics Program at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital. Her team has been engaged in COVID-19 response efforts since January 2020.

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to digitized whole slide images (WSIs) can aid pathologists in cancer diagnosis, but robust, diverse evidence in a simulated clinical setting is lacking.\nTo compare the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists reading WSIs of prostatic biopsy specimens with and without AI assistance.\nEighteen pathologists, 2 of whom were genitourinary subspecialists, evaluated 610 prostate needle core biopsy WSIs prepared at 218 institutions, with the option for deferral. Two evaluations were performed sequentially for each WSI: initially without assistance, and immediately thereafter aided by Paige Prostate (PaPr), a deep learning-based system that provides a WSI-level binary classification of suspicious for cancer or benign and pinpoints the location that has the greatest probability of harboring cancer on suspicious WSIs. Pathologists' changes in sensitivity and specificity between the assisted and unassisted modalities were assessed, together with the impact of PaPr output on the assisted reads.\nUsing PaPr, pathologists improved their sensitivity and specificity across all histologic grades and tumor sizes. Accuracy gains on both benign and cancerous WSIs could be attributed to PaPr, which correctly classified 100% of the WSIs showing corrected diagnoses in the PaPr-assisted phase.\nThis study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of an AI tool for pathologists in simulated diagnostic practice, bridging the gap between computational pathology research and its clinical application, and resulted in the first US Food and Drug Administration authorization of an AI system in pathology.", "One challenge in the field of in-vitro fertilisation is the selection of the most viable embryos for transfer. Morphological quality assessment and morphokinetic analysis both have the disadvantage of intra-observer and inter-observer variability. A third method, preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A), has limitations too, including its invasiveness and cost. We hypothesised that differences in aneuploid and euploid embryos that allow for model-based classification are reflected in morphology, morphokinetics, and associated clinical information.\nIn this retrospective study, we used machine-learning and deep-learning approaches to develop STORK-A, a non-invasive and automated method of embryo evaluation that uses artificial intelligence to predict embryo ploidy status. Our method used a dataset of 10\u2009378 embryos that consisted of static images captured at 110 h after intracytoplasmic sperm injection, morphokinetic parameters, blastocyst morphological assessments, maternal age, and ploidy status. Independent and external datasets, Weill Cornell Medicine EmbryoScope+ (WCM-ES+; Weill Cornell Medicine Center of Reproductive Medicine, NY, USA) and IVI Valencia (IVI Valencia, Health Research Institute la Fe, Valencia, Spain) were used to test the generalisability of STORK-A and were compared measuring accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\nAnalysis and model development included the use of 10\u2009378 embryos, all with PGT-A results, from 1385 patients (maternal age range 21-48 years; mean age 36\u00b798 years [SD 4\u00b762]). STORK-A predicted aneuploid versus euploid embryos with an accuracy of 69\u00b73% (95% CI 66\u00b79-71\u00b75; AUC 0\u00b7761; positive predictive value [PPV] 76\u00b71%; negative predictive value [NPV] 62\u00b71%) when using images, maternal age, morphokinetics, and blastocyst score. A second classification task trained to predict complex aneuploidy versus euploidy and single aneuploidy produced an accuracy of 74\u00b70% (95% CI 71\u00b77-76\u00b71; AUC 0\u00b7760; PPV 54\u00b79%; NPV 87\u00b76%) using an image, maternal age, morphokinetic parameters, and blastocyst grade. A third classification task trained to predict complex aneuploidy versus euploidy had an accuracy of 77\u00b76% (95% CI 75\u00b70-80\u00b70; AUC 0\u00b7847; PPV 76\u00b77%; NPV 78\u00b70%). STORK-A reported accuracies of 63\u00b74% (AUC 0\u00b7702) on the WCM-ES+ dataset and 65\u00b77% (AUC 0\u00b7715) on the IVI Valencia dataset, when using an image, maternal age, and morphokinetic parameters, similar to the STORK-A test dataset accuracy of 67\u00b78% (AUC 0\u00b7737), showing generalisability.\nAs a proof of concept, STORK-A shows an ability to predict embryo ploidy in a non-invasive manner and shows future potential as a standardised supplementation to traditional methods of embryo selection and prioritisation for implantation or recommendation for PGT-A.\nUS National Institutes of Health.", "Recent developments in deep learning have enabled data-driven algorithms that can reach human-level performance and beyond. The development and deployment of medical image analysis methods have several challenges, including data heterogeneity due to population diversity and different device manufacturers. In addition, more input from experts is required for a reliable method development process. While the exponential growth in clinical imaging data has enabled deep learning to flourish, data heterogeneity, multi-modality, and rare or inconspicuous disease cases still need to be explored. Endoscopy being highly operator-dependent with grim clinical outcomes in some disease cases, reliable and accurate automated system guidance can improve patient care. Most designed methods must be more generalisable to the unseen target data, patient population variability, and variable disease appearances. The paper reviews recent works on endoscopic image analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) and emphasises the current unmatched needs in this field. Finally, it outlines the future directions for clinically relevant complex AI solutions to improve patient outcomes.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have already started impacting clinical practice across various settings worldwide, including the radiography profession. This study is aimed at exploring a world-wide view on AI technologies in relation to knowledge, perceptions, and expectations of radiography professionals.\nAn online survey (hosted on Qualtrics) on key AI concepts was open to radiography professionals worldwide (August 1st to December 31st 2020). The survey sought both quantitative and qualitative data on topical issues relating to knowledge, perceptions, and expectations in relation to AI implementation in radiography practice. Data obtained was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (v.26) and the six-phase thematic analysis approach.\nA total of 314 valid responses were obtained with a fair geographical distribution. Of the respondents, 54.1% (157/290) were from North America and were predominantly clinical practicing radiographers (60.5%, 190/314). Our findings broadly relate to different perceived benefits and misgivings/shortcomings of AI implementation in radiography practice. The benefits relate to enhanced workflows and optimised workstreams while the misgivings/shortcomings revolve around de-skilling and impact on patient-centred care due to over-reliance on advanced technology following AI implementation.\nArtificial intelligence is a tool but to operate optimally it requires human input and validation. Radiographers working at the interface between technology and the patient are key stakeholders in AI implementation. Lack of training and of transparency of AI tools create a mixed response of radiographers when they discuss their perceived benefits and challenges. It is also possible that their responses are nuanced by different regional and geographical contexts when it comes to AI deployment. Irrespective of geography, there is still a lot to be done about formalised AI training for radiographers worldwide. This is a vital step to ensure safe and effective AI implementation, adoption, and faster integration into clinical practice by healthcare workers including radiographers.\nAdvancement of AI technologies and implementation should be accompanied by proportional training of end-users in radiography and beyond. There are many benefits of AI-enabled radiography workflows and improvement on efficiencies but equally there will be widespread disruption of traditional roles and patient-centred care, which can be managed by a well-educated and well-informed workforce.", "Francesco Ciompi is an associate professor at Radboud University Medical Center. His group focuses on computational pathology, i.e., the development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) for digital pathology and precision oncology.

We investigated the associations between anesthetics/sedatives and full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) measured at 36 months corrected age (CA) in very preterm infants (born < 29 weeks gestational age).\nThis retrospective cohort study included preterm infants born at < 29 weeks of gestation between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2012, whose cognitive outcomes were assessed at 36 months CA. Imputed and complete case univariable and adjusted multivariable linear regressions were used to investigate the associations between FSIQ [standardized to mean (standard deviation) 100 (15)] and exposure to volatile anesthetics, propofol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and ketamine. These agents were the subject of a 2016 warning from regulatory authorities in the USA recommending caution for administration to children and pregnant women.\nA total of 731 infants met the inclusion criteria. Unadjusted associations were -7 (95% confidence interval [CI], -10 to -4; P < 0.001) and -6 (95% CI, -10 to -3; P < 0.001) FSIQ points with exposure to warned medications using imputed and complete case analyses, respectively. Imputed and complete case adjusted associations between FSIQ and warned medications were -3 (95% CI, -7 to 0; P = 0.045) and -4 (95% CI, -8 to 0; P = 0.071) FSIQ points, respectively. Adjusted associations between volatile anesthetic exposure only and FSIQ were -3 (95% CI, -6 to 0; P = 0.072) and -5 (95% CI, -9 to -2; P = 0.004) FSIQ points using imputed and complete case data sets, respectively. FSIQ was not associated with opioid exposure.\nExposure of very preterm infants to anesthetics/sedatives on the United States Food and Drug Administration warning list was associated with a decrease in FSIQ points at 36 months CA.

This prospective clinical study aimed to develop artificial intelligence to increase PSI production efficiency and assess accuracy, clinical outcomes, and learning curves.\nA convolutional neural network was applied to automatically process computer tomography images. PSI size and position were designed to guide the acetabular preparation and femoral neck resection.\u00a0Thirty patients who underwent PSI-assisted THAs were matched to thirty patients who underwent free-hand THAs, and the component positions, as well as radiographic and clinical outcomes were analyzed.\nPSI-assisted THA was significantly more accurate than free-hand THA at achieving the target component position. The mean absolute errors of cup inclination (P\u00a0= .004) and anteversion (P < .001) were significantly smaller in the PSI group with fewer outliers. Calcar length (P\u00a0= .002) and neck length (P\u00a0= .026) were also more accurate in the PSI group. The leg length discrepancy was significantly lower in the PSI group (P\u00a0= .002). There were no significant differences in operation time, blood loss, leg length discrepancy, or cup position among the first, second, and last 10 cases.\nPSI-assisted THA offered more accurate component positions and better radiographic outcomes than free-hand THA. There was no evidence of a learning curve. Our findings suggest that PSI is a convenient and practical option to help surgeons achieve accurate surgical outcomes.", "Brain neuron activity is closely related to cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes. Alterations in the regional homogeneity (ReHo) and CBF occur in patients with magnetic resonance imaging negative focal epilepsy (FEP-MRI-). However, the coupling alterations of ReHo and CBF in FEP-MRI- remain unclear. The study aims to explore neurovascular coupling alterations and their clinical implication in FEP-MRI-. We collected resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 31 healthy controls (HCs) and 48 patients with FEP-MRI-,including three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted imaging, 3D arterial spin labeling (ASL) imaging,and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). The CBF and ReHo values were calculated from the ASL and rs-fMRI data, respectively. The CBF/ReHo ratio per voxel and whole-brain CBF-ReHo coupling were compared between the two groups. Correlation analysis involved the CBF/ReHo ratio and clinical indicators in FEP-MRI-. Patients with FEP-MRI- showed significantly increased cross-subject CBF-ReHo and global cross-voxel CBF-ReHo coupling. The CBF/ReHo ratio was higher in the bilateral orbitofrontal gyrus, right parietal lobe, and right middle frontal gyrus of patients with FEP-MRI-. Nevertheless, this ratio was lower in the bilateral supplementary motor areas, the left middle and posterior cingulate gyrus, and the right central sulcus cover. The CBF/ReHo ratio was markedly correlated with cognitive function, memory, intelligence, and epilepsy duration in the above abnormal brain regions. CBF/ReHo ratio may be useful as an indicator of neuropathological mechanisms. These results support the hypothesis that CBF/ReHo ratio relates to the neuropathological mechanisms of FEP-MRI-. Furthermore, it offers new perspectives for studying the mechanisms of MRI-negative epilepsy.", "Precision medicine requires a deep understanding of complex biomedical and healthcare data, which is being generated at exponential rates and increasingly made available through public biobanks, electronic medical record systems and biomedical databases and knowledgebases. The complexity and sheer amount of data prohibit manual manipulation. Instead, the field depends on artificial intelligence approaches to parse, annotate, evaluate and interpret the data to enable applications to patient healthcare At the 2023 Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) session entitled \"Precision Medicine: Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve diagnostics and healthcare\", we spotlight research that develops and applies computational methodologies to solve biomedical problems.", "Microscopy has long played a pivotal role in the field of assisted reproductive technology (ART). The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has opened the door for new approaches to sperm and oocyte assessment and selection, with the potential for improved ART outcomes.", "Among medical specialties, laboratory medicine is the largest producer of structured data and must play a crucial role for the efficient and safe implementation of big\u00a0data and artificial intelligence in healthcare. The area of\u00a0personalized therapies and precision medicine has now arrived, with huge data sets not only used for experimental and research approaches, but also in the \"real world\". Analysis of real world data requires development of legal, procedural and technical infrastructure. The integration of\u00a0all clinical data sets for any given patient is important and necessary in order to develop a patient-centered treatment approach. Data-driven research comes with its own challenges and solutions. The Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) Guiding Principles provide guidelines to make data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable to the research community. Federated learning, standards and ontologies are useful to improve robustness of artificial intelligence algorithms working on big data and to increase trust in\u00a0these algorithms. When dealing with big data, the univariate statistical approach changes to multivariate statistical methods significantly shifting the potential of big\u00a0data. Combining multiple omics gives previously unsuspected information and provides understanding of scientific questions, an approach which is also called the systems biology approach. Big data and artificial intelligence also offer opportunities for laboratories and the In\u00a0Vitro Diagnostic industry to optimize the productivity of\u00a0the laboratory, the quality of laboratory results and ultimately patient outcomes, through tools such as predictive maintenance and \"moving average\" based on the aggregate of patient results.", "Efficacy and safety are among the most desirable characteristics of an ideal drug. The tremendous increase in computing power and the entry of artificial intelligence into the field of computational drug design are accelerating the process of identifying, developing, and optimizing potential drugs. Here, we present novel approach to design new molecules with desired properties. We combined various neural networks and linear regression algorithms to build models for cytotoxicity and anti-HIV activity based on Continual Molecular Interior analysis (CoMIn) and Cinderella's Shoe (CiS) derived molecular descriptors. After validating the reliability of the models, a genetic algorithm was coupled with the Des-Pot Grid algorithm to generate new molecules from a predefined pool of molecular fragments and predict their bioactivity and cytotoxicity. This combination led to the proposal of 16 hit molecules with high anti-HIV activity and low cytotoxicity.

Nowadays, with the increasing use of electronic health records (EHR), advances in patient information retrieval, and cost reduction in clinical informatics, artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to improve early recognition and management for perioperative AKI. However, there is no quantitative synthesis of the performance of these methods. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of artificial intelligence for the prediction of acute kidney injury during the perioperative period.\nPubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched to 2nd October 2021. Studies presenting diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence in the early detection of perioperative acute kidney injury were included. True positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives were pooled to collate specificity and sensitivity with 95% CIs and results were portrayed in forest plots. The risk of bias of eligible studies was assessed using the PROBAST tool.\nNineteen studies involving 304,076 patients were included. Quantitative random-effects meta-analysis using the Rutter and Gatsonis hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) model revealed pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.81),0.75 (95% CI: 0.71 to 0.80), and 10.7 (95% CI 8.5 to 13.5), respectively. Threshold effect was found to be the only source of heterogeneity, and there was no evidence of publication bias.\nOur review demonstrates the promising performance of artificial intelligence for early prediction of perioperative AKI. The limitations of lacking external validation performance and being conducted only at a single center should be overcome.\nThis study was not registered with PROSPERO.", "Intraoperative skills assessment is time-consuming and subjective; an efficient and objective computer vision-based approach for feedback is desired. In this work, we aim to design and validate an interpretable automated method to evaluate technical proficiency using colorectal robotic surgery videos with artificial intelligence.\n92 curated clips of peritoneal closure were characterized by both board-certified surgeons and a computer vision AI algorithm to compare the measures of surgical skill. For human ratings, six surgeons graded clips according to the GEARS assessment tool; for AI assessment, deep learning computer vision algorithms for surgical tool detection and tracking were developed and implemented.\nFor the GEARS category of efficiency, we observe a positive correlation between human expert ratings of technical efficiency and AI-determined total tool movement (r\u2009=\u2009-\u00a00.72). Additionally, we show that more proficient surgeons perform closure with significantly less tool movement compared to less proficient surgeons (p\u2009<\u20090.001). For the GEARS category of bimanual dexterity, a positive correlation between expert ratings of bimanual dexterity and the AI model's calculated measure of bimanual movement based on simultaneous tool movement (r\u2009=\u20090.48) was also observed. On average, we also find that higher skill clips have significantly more simultaneous movement in both hands compared to lower skill clips (p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nIn this study, measurements of technical proficiency extracted from AI algorithms are shown to correlate with those given by expert surgeons. Although we target measurements of efficiency and bimanual dexterity, this work suggests that artificial intelligence through computer vision holds promise for efficiently standardizing grading of surgical technique, which may help in surgical skills training.", "Artificial intelligence can improve various orthopaedic subspecialties in the next 5 to 10 years. There are several image recognition applications particularly in orthopedic trauma and orthopedic spine. Specifically, convolutional neural networks have been shown to work well for making diagnoses and recreating more advanced imaging form radiographs. There are many applications of artificial intelligence with predictive in total joint arthroplasty, particularly with shared decision making. And there are many day-to-day applications that can be improved with natural language processing, particularly administrative tasks. This includes several applications in billing and charting. When investigating the landscape of artificial intelligence in healthcare, there are many barriers to their adoption. This includes overcoming bias, incorporating new applications into clinical workflow, regulatory approval, and billing.", "Central to modern neuroscientific theories of human intelligence is the notion that general intelligence depends on a primary brain region or network, engaging spatially localized (rather than global) neural representations. Recent findings in network neuroscience, however, challenge this assumption, providing evidence that general intelligence may depend on system-wide network mechanisms, suggesting that local representations are necessary but not sufficient to account for the neural architecture of human intelligence. Despite the importance of this key theoretical distinction, prior research has not systematically investigated the role of local versus global neural representations in predicting general intelligence. We conducted a large-scale connectome-based predictive modeling study (N\u00a0=\u2009297), administering resting-state fMRI and a comprehensive cognitive battery to evaluate the efficacy of modern neuroscientific theories of human intelligence, including spatially localized theories (Lateral Prefrontal Cortex Theory, Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory, and Multiple Demand Theory) and recent global accounts (Process Overlap Theory and Network Neuroscience Theory). The results of our study demonstrate that general intelligence can be predicted by local functional connectivity profiles but is most robustly explained by global profiles of whole-brain connectivity. Our findings further suggest that the improved efficacy of global theories is not reducible to a greater strength or number of connections, but instead results from considering both strong and weak connections that provide the basis for intelligence (as predicted by the Network Neuroscience Theory). Our results highlight the importance of considering local neural representations in the context of a global information-processing architecture, suggesting future directions for theory-driven research on system-wide network mechanisms underlying general intelligence.", "Automated and data-driven methods for screening using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning may replace resource-intensive manual approaches in the usual care of patients hospitalized with conditions related to unhealthy substance use. The rigorous evaluation of tools that use artificial intelligence (AI) is necessary to demonstrate effectiveness before system-wide implementation. An NLP tool to use routinely collected data in the electronic health record was previously validated for diagnostic accuracy in a retrospective study for screening unhealthy substance use. Our next step is a noninferiority design incorporated into a research protocol for clinical implementation with prospective evaluation of clinical effectiveness in a large health system.\nThis study aims to provide a study protocol to evaluate health outcomes and the costs and benefits of an AI-driven automated screener compared to manual human screening for unhealthy substance use.\nA pre-post design is proposed to evaluate 12 months of manual screening followed by 12 months of automated screening across surgical and medical wards at a single medical center. The preintervention period consists of usual care with manual screening by nurses and social workers and referrals to a multidisciplinary Substance Use Intervention Team (SUIT). Facilitated by a NLP pipeline in the postintervention period, clinical notes from the first 24 hours of hospitalization will be processed and scored by a machine learning model, and the SUIT will be similarly alerted to patients who flagged positive for substance misuse. Flowsheets within the electronic health record have been updated to capture rates of interventions for the primary outcome (brief intervention/motivational interviewing, medication-assisted treatment, naloxone dispensing, and referral to outpatient care). Effectiveness in terms of patient outcomes will be determined by noninferior rates of interventions (primary outcome), as well as rates of readmission within 6 months, average time to consult, and discharge rates against medical advice (secondary outcomes) in the postintervention period by a SUIT compared to the preintervention period. A separate analysis will be performed to assess the costs and benefits to the health system by using automated screening. Changes from the pre- to postintervention period will be assessed in covariate-adjusted generalized linear mixed-effects models.\nThe study will begin in September 2022. Monthly data monitoring and Data Safety Monitoring Board reporting are scheduled every 6 months throughout the study period. We anticipate reporting final results by June 2025.\nThe use of augmented intelligence for clinical decision support is growing with an increasing number of AI tools. We provide a research protocol for prospective evaluation of an automated NLP system for screening unhealthy substance use using a noninferiority design to demonstrate comprehensive screening that may be as effective as manual screening but less costly via automated solutions.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03833804; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03833804.\nDERR1-10.2196/42971.", "Recent statistics from the European Commission indicate that wine is one of the commodities most commonly subject to food fraud. In this context, the development of reliable classification models to differentiate alcoholic beverages requires, besides sensitive analytical tools, the use of the most suitable data-processing methods like those based on advanced statistical tools or artificial intelligence.\nThe present study aims to establish a new, innovative approach for the differentiation of alcoholic beverages (wines and fruit distillates), which is able to increase the discrimination rate of the models that have been developed. A data dimensionality reduction step was applied to proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR) profiles. This stage consisted of the application of fuzzy principal component analysis (FPCA) prior to\u00a0the development of classification models\u00a0through discriminant analysis. The enhancement of the model's classification potential by the application of FPCA in comparison with principal component analysis (PCA) was discussed.\nThe association of 1 H-NMR spectroscopy and an appropriate statistical approach provided a very effective tool for the differentiation of alcoholic beverages. To develop reliable metabolomic approaches for the differentiation of wines and fruit distillates, 1 H-NMR spectroscopic data were exploited in conjunction with fuzzy algorithms to reduce data dimensionality. The study proved the greater efficiency of using FPCA scores in comparison with those obtained through the widely applied PCA. The proposed approach enabled wines to be distinguished perfectly according to their geographical origins, cultivar, and vintage, and this could be used for wine classification. Moreover, 100% correctly classified samples were also achieved for the botanical and geographical differentiation of fruit distillates. \u00a9 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.", "In the paper, the authors investigated and predicted the future environmental circumstances of a COVID-19 to minimize its effects using artificial intelligence techniques. The experimental investigation of COVID-19 instances has been performed in ten countries, including India, the United States, Russia, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Turkey, Germany, and France using machine learning, deep learning, and time series models. The confirmed, deceased, and recovered datasets from January 22, 2020, to May 29, 2021, of Novel COVID-19 cases were considered from the Kaggle COVID dataset repository. The country-wise Exploratory Data Analysis visually represents the active, recovered, closed, and death cases from March 2020 to May 2021. The data are pre-processed and scaled using a MinMax scaler to extract and normalize the features to obtain an accurate prediction rate. The proposed methodology employs Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, K Nearest Regressor, Lasso Regression, Linear Regression, Bayesian Regression, Theilsen Regression, Kernel Ridge Regressor, RANSAC Regressor, XG Boost, Elastic Net Regressor, Facebook Prophet Model, Holt Model, Stacked Long Short-Term Memory, and Stacked Gated Recurrent Units to predict active COVID-19 confirmed, death, and recovered cases. Out of different machine learning, deep learning, and time series models, Random Forest Regressor, Facebook Prophet, and Stacked LSTM outperformed to predict the best results for COVID-19 instances with the lowest root-mean-square and highest R 2 score values.", "This study introduces an experimental paradigm for a usability test of emerging technologies in a management information system (MIS). The usability test included both subjective and objective evaluations. For the subjective evaluation, a usability questionnaire and a NASA-TLX scale were adopted. For the objective evaluation, methods of Neuro-Information-Systems (NeuroIS) were used. From a NeuroIS perspective, this study used mobile fNIRS and eye tracking glasses for multimodal measurements, which solved the problem of ecological validity of cognitive neuroscience tools used in real-world behavior experiments. This study used Augmented Reality (AR) integrated into the Internet of Things (IoT) as an experimental object. Comparing the differences in the neuroimaging data, the physiological data, the usability questionnaire, and the NASA-TLX scale data between the two information-search modes (AR versus a website), information search with AR had a higher efficiency and a lower cognitive load compared with information search with a website during the process of consumption decision-making. The usability experiment results demonstrate that AR, as an emerging technology in retail, can effectively enhance consumer experiences and increase their purchase intention. The experimental paradigm, combining both subjective and objective evaluations in this study, could be applied to a usability test for emerging technologies, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, wearable technology, robotics, and big data. It provides a practical experimental solution for the user experience in human-computer-interactions with the adoption of emerging technologies.", "Diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the chronic complications of diabetes, is a serious and irreversible blinding disease. It is difficult to detect in the early stage, to control in the progressive stage, to operate in the advanced stage of DR. Recently, the \"14th Five-year plan\" for National Eye Health proposed to \"improve the management mode of chronic eye disease, and build a chronic disease management system\". The project team used artificial intelligence technology based on cloud platform, joint outpatient service, virtual ward to explore the comprehensive management of DR from the aspects of early screening, multidisciplinary collaborative diagnosis and treatment, and refined blood glucose management during perioperative period. In the future, it is urgent to integrate DR chronic disease management with other systemic chronic diseases to reduce the blindness caused by DR.\n\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u6027\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\uff08diabetic retinopathy\uff0cDR\uff09\u662f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u6162\u6027\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u662f\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u3001\u96be\u9006\u8f6c\u7684\u81f4\u76f2\u6027\u773c\u75c5\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u96be\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u4e2d\u671f\u96be\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u665a\u671f\u96be\u624b\u672f\u3002\u8fd1\u671f\u201c\u5341\u56db\u4e94\u201d\u5168\u56fd\u773c\u5065\u5eb7\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u5b8c\u5584\u6162\u6027\u773c\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u773c\u75c5\u6162\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u4f53\u7cfb\u201d\u3002\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u56e2\u961f\u524d\u671f\u8fd0\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u3001\u8054\u5408\u95e8\u8bca\u3001\u4e91\u7aef\u865a\u62df\u75c5\u623f\u7b49\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u3001\u8fdb\u5c55\u671f\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u534f\u4f5c\u8bca\u7597\u3001\u665a\u671f\u56f4\u624b\u672f\u671f\u8840\u7cd6\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u63a2\u7d22DR\u5168\u75c5\u7a0b\u6162\u75c5\u7efc\u5408\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u672a\u6765\u4e9f\u5f85\u5c06DR\u6162\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u5168\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7efc\u5408\u7ba1\u7406\u878d\u5408\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11DR\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76f2\u3002.", "Basic psychological needs satisfaction (BPNS) and Emotional intelligence (EI) have been underscored as helpful psychological constructs in explaining academic engagement. However, the joint interaction of BPNS with EI abilities to explain academic engagement has not been tested. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the interactive role of BPNS with EI abilities in the prediction of academic engagement in a sample of Chinese university students.\nA questionnaire survey was administered to a sample of 466 university students. The data were analyzed using the SPSS (version 21.0) software. The first analysis consisted of descriptive statistics (including mean and standard deviation) and Pearson's correlations among BPNS, EI, and academic engagement. Through structural equation modeling (SEM), direct and indirect effects were calculated.\nThe results showed that BPNS was positively associated with academic engagement and that only the Use of emotion dimension of EI mediated these associations.\nThese results suggest that important interventions incorporated with BPNS and EI abilities, especially the use of emotion ability, may be performed to promote university students' academic engagement.", "Although genetic and environmental factors influence general intelligence (g-factor), few studies examined the neuroanatomical measures mediating environmental and genetic effects on intelligence. Here, we investigate the brain volumes, cortical mean thicknesses, and cortical surface areas mediating the effects of the g-factor polygenic score (gPGS) and childhood adversity on the g-factor in the UK Biobank. We first examined the global and regional brain measures that contribute to the g-factor. Most regions contributed to the g-factor through global brain size. Parieto-frontal integration theory (P-FIT) regions were not more associated with the g-factor than non-PFIT regions. After adjusting for global brain size and regional associations, only a few regions predicted intelligence and were included in the mediation analyses. We conducted mediation analyses on global measures, regional volumes, mean thicknesses, and surface areas, separately. Total brain volume mediated 7.04% of the gPGS' effect on the g-factor and 2.50% of childhood adversity's effect on the g-factor. In comparison, the fraction of the gPGS and childhood adversity's effects mediated by individual regional volumes, surfaces, and mean thicknesses was 10-15 times smaller. Therefore, genetic and environmental effects on intelligence may be mediated to a larger extent by other brain properties.", "COVID-19, a worldwide pandemic that has affected many people and thousands of individuals have died due to COVID-19, during the last two years. Due to the benefits of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in X-ray image interpretation, sound analysis, diagnosis, patient monitoring, and CT image identification, it has been further researched in the area of medical science during the period of COVID-19. This study has assessed the performance and investigated different machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and combinations of various ML, DL, and AI approaches that have been employed in recent studies with diverse data formats to combat the problems that have arisen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, this study shows the comparison among the stand-alone ML and DL-based research works regarding the COVID-19 issues with the combinations of ML, DL, and AI-based research works. After in-depth analysis and comparison, this study responds to the proposed research questions and presents the future research directions in this context. This review work will guide different research groups to develop viable applications based on ML, DL, and AI models, and will also guide healthcare institutes, researchers, and governments by showing them how these techniques can ease the process of tackling the COVID-19.", "Sociogenomics examines the extent to which genetic differences between individuals relate to differences in social and economic behaviors and outcomes. The field evokes mixed reactions. For some, sociogenomics runs the risk of normalizing eugenic attitudes and legitimizing social inequalities. For others, sociogenomics brings the promise of more robust and nuanced understandings of human behavior. Regardless, a history of misuse and misapplication of genetics raises important questions about researchers' social responsibilities. This paper draws on semi-structured interviews with sociogenomics researchers who investigate intelligence and educational attainment. It does so to understand how researcher's motivations for engaging in a historically burdened field connect to their views on social responsibility and the challenges that come with it. In interviews, researchers highlighted the trade-off between engaging in socially contested research and the potential benefits their work poses to the social sciences and clinical research. They also highlighted the dilemmas of engaging with the public, including the existence of multiple publics. Finally, researchers elucidated uncertainties over what social responsibility is in practice and whether protecting against the misuse and misinterpretation of their research is wholly possible. This paper concludes by offering ways to address some of the challenges of social responsibility in the production of knowledge.", "Healthcaare delivery will change through the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI). Physicians are likely to be among the professions most affected, though to what extent is not yet clear.\nWe analyzed physicians' and AI experts' stances towards AI-induced changes. This concerned (1) physicians' tasks, (2) job replacement risk, and (3) implications for the ways of working, including human-AI interaction, changes in job profiles, and hierarchical and cross-professional collaboration patterns.\nWe adopted an exploratory, qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews with 24 experts in the fields of AI and medicine, medical informatics, digital medicine, and medical education and training. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was performed.\nSpecialized tasks currently performed by physicians in all areas of medicine would likely be taken over by AI, including bureaucratic tasks, clinical decision support, and research. However, the concern that physicians will be replaced by an AI system is unfounded, according to experts; AI systems today would be designed only for a specific use case and could not replace the human factor in the patient-physician relationship. Nevertheless, the job profile and professional role of physicians would be transformed as a result of new forms of human-AI collaboration and shifts to higher-value activities. AI could spur novel, more interprofessional teams in medical practice and research and, eventually, democratization and de-hierarchization.\nThe study highlights changes in job profiles of physicians and outlines demands for new categories of medical professionals considering AI-induced changes of work. Physicians should redefine their self-image and assume more responsibility in the age of AI-supported medicine. There is a need for the development of scenarios and concepts for future job profiles in the health professions as well as their education and training.", "Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal disorder and it is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21). Subjects with DS show a large heterogeneity of phenotypes and the most constant clinical features present are typical facies and intellectual disability (ID). Several studies demonstrated that trisomy 21 causes an alteration in the metabolic profile, involving among all the one-carbon cycle.\nWe performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to identify the concentration of 5 different intermediates of the one-carbon cycle in plasma samples obtained from a total of 164 subjects with DS compared to 54 euploid subjects. We investigated: tetrahydrofolate (THF; DS n = 108, control n = 41), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-THF; DS n = 140, control n = 34), 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formyl-THF; DS n = 80, control n = 21), S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH; DS n = 94, control n = 20) and S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM; DS n = 24, control n = 15).\nResults highlight specific alterations of THF with a median concentration ratio DS/control of 2:3, a decrease of a necessary molecule perfectly consistent with a chromosomal dosage effect. Moreover, SAM and SAH show a ratio DS/control of 1.82:1 and 3.6:1, respectively.\nThe relevance of these results for the biology of intelligence and its impairment in trisomy 21 is discussed, leading to the final proposal of 5-methyl-THF as the best candidate for a clinical trial aimed at restoring the dysregulation of one-carbon cycle in trisomy 21, possibly improving cognitive skills of subjects with DS.", "The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology has led to Food and Drug Administration clearance of more than 20 AI algorithms for breast imaging. The steps involved in the clinical implementation of an AI product include identifying all stakeholders, selecting the appropriate product to purchase, evaluating it with a local data set, integrating it into the workflow, and monitoring its performance over time. Despite the potential benefits of improved quality and increased efficiency with AI, several barriers, such as high costs and liability concerns, may limit its widespread implementation. This article lists currently available AI products for breast imaging, describes the key elements of clinical implementation, and discusses barriers to clinical implementation.", "Mechanical ventilators are medical devices used in intensive care units when patients are in need of mechanical aid to facilitate the process of breathing. As the function of breathing is the exchange of gases, the mechanical ventilator takes over that function while the patient is incapable to spontaneous breathing. As these devices are used to maintain the life of patents, their performance must be ensured and there cannot be significant deviations in the volumes and pressure of gases they introduce to the patient. The new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) defines medical device post-market surveillance (PMS) as performed by independent, third-party, notified bodies more strategically in hope to improve traceability of device performance. However, there is still an apparent gap in terms of standardised conformity assessment testing methods.\nThis paper proposes a novel method for conformity assessment testing of mechanical ventilators for post-market surveillance purposes.\nThe method was developed on the basis of metrology characteristics of mechanical ventilators and evaluation of their vital safety and performance parameters. In addition to the evaluation of essential safety and visual integrity of mechanical ventilators, their performance in terms of volume of oxygen delivered to the patient as well as the flow and pressure of the delivered gas is evaluated.\nThe developed method was validated between 2018 and 2021 in healthcare institutions of all levels. The results obtained during validation suggest that conformity assessment testing of mechanical ventilators as a method used during PMS contributes to significant improvement in devices' accuracy and reliability.\nA standardized approach in conformity assessment testing of mechanical ventilators during PMS, besides increasing reliability of the devices, is the first step in digital transformation of management of these devices in healthcare institutions opening possibility for use of artificial intelligence.", "The rapid spread of COVID-19 and its variants have devastated communities worldwide, and as the highly transmissible Omicron variant becomes the dominant strain of the virus in late 2021, the need to characterize and understand the difference between the new variant and its predecessors has been an increasing priority for public health authorities. Artificial Intelligence has played a significant role in the analysis of various facets of COVID-19 since the early stages of the pandemic. This study proposes the use of AI, specifically an XGBoost model, to quantify the impact of various medical risk factors (or \"population features\") on the possibility of a patient outcome resulting in hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. The results are compared between the Delta and Omicron COVID-19 variants. Results indicated that older age and an unvaccinated patient status most consistently correspond as the most significant population features contributing to all three scenarios (hospitalization, ICU, death). The top 15 features for each variant-outcome scenario were determined, which most frequently included diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and complications of pneumonia as highly significant population features contributing to serious illness outcomes. The Delta/Hospitalization model returned the highest performance metric scores for the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), F1, and Recall, while Omicron/ICU and Omicron/Hospitalization had the highest accuracy and precision values, respectively. The recall was found to be above 0.60 in most cases (with only two exceptions), indicating that the total number of false positives was generally minimized (accounting for more of the people who would theoretically require medical care).", "Traditional drug development is a tedious process with involvement of enormous cost and a high attrition rate. Outsourcing drug development services to contract research organizations (CROs) has become an important strategy for cost and risk reduction, capacity building, and data generation. The therapeutic and operational expertise of these CROs has allowed pharmaceutical industry to reduce in-house infrastructure as well as research capacity. Working with specialized CROs has not only increased the rate of success but also the speed of drug discovery process. Small firms with promising molecules but limited resources and large firms interested in diversifying their dimensions are utilizing the services of efficient CROs. Globally, approximately one-third of the drug development processes are now being outsourced and the data generated by the independent third party are well appreciated during regulatory submissions. In this article, we discuss the international and national trends, outsourcing services and models, key considerations while selecting CRO, and benefits and challenges of outsourcing. Further, we discuss how the technical expertise of competent CROs was utilized when traditional ways of conducting clinical trials were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Taken together, the increasing health-care demands, COVID-19 pandemic or any other such upcoming health crisis, and recent advances in advanced technologies (machine learning and artificial intelligence, etc.) are likely to fuel global CRO market in the coming years.", "Sciatica is a pain disorder often caused by the herniated disk compressing the lumbosacral nerve roots. Neuroimaging studies have identified functional abnormalities in patients with chronic sciatica (CS). However, few studies have investigated the neural marker of CS using brain structure and the classification value of multidimensional neuroimaging features in CS patients is unclear.\nHere, structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was acquired for 34 CS patients and 36 matched healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed cortical surface area, cortical thickness, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (REHO), between-regions functional connectivity (FC), and assessed the correlation between neuroimaging measures and clinical scores. Finally, the multimodal neuroimaging features were used to differentiate the CS patients and HC individuals by support vector machine (SVM) algorithm.\nCompared to HC, CS patients had a larger cortical surface area in the right banks of the superior temporal sulcus and rostral anterior cingulate; higher ALFF value in the left inferior frontal gyrus; enhanced FCs between somatomotor and ventral attention network. Three FCs values were associated with clinical pain scores. Furthermore, the three multimodal neuroimaging features with significant differences between groups and the SVM algorithm could classify CS patients and HC with an accuracy of 90.00%.\nTogether, our findings revealed extensive reorganization of local functional properties, surface area, and network metrics in CS patients. The success of patient identification highlights the potential of using artificial intelligence and multimodal neuroimaging markers in chronic pain research.", "Dialysis machines are used regularly in healthcare practice. They are classified as a type of medical device with moderate and high risk therefore significant requirements are placed on their safety and performance every time they are used on patients. The new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) defines medical device post-market surveillance (PMS) as performed by independent, third-party, notified bodies more strategically in hope to improve traceability of device performance. However, there is still an apparent gap in terms of standardised conformity assessment testing methods.\nThis paper proposes a novel evidence-based method for conformity assessment testing of dialysis machines for post-market surveillance purposes.\nThe novel method is developed according to the International Organisation of Legal Metrology (OIML) guidelines and is to be used for the purpose of conformity assessment testing of Dialysis machines with respect to their metrological characteristics during PMS.\nThe developed method was validated between 2018 and 2021 in healthcare institutions of all levels. The results obtained during validation suggest that conformity assessment testing of dialysis machines as a method used during PMS contributes to significant improvement in devices' accuracy and reliability.\nA standardized approach in conformity assessment testing of dialysis machines during PMS, besides increasing reliability of the devices, is the first step in digital transformation of management of these devices in healthcare institutions opening possibility for use of artificial intelligence.", "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a prime health concern globally. These bacteria are found in hospital areas where they are regularly dealing with antibiotics. This brings many possibilities for its mutation, so drug resistance occurs.\nNowadays, these nosocomial MRSA strains spread into the community and live stocks. Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus is due to mutations in their genetic elements.\nAs the bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, new approaches like antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a vital role and are more efficacious, economical, time, and energy saviours.\nMachine learning approaches of Artificial Intelligence are the in silico technique which has their importance in better prediction, analysis, and fetching of important details regarding AMPs.\nAnti-microbial peptides could be the next-generation solution to combat drug resistance among Superbugs. For better prediction and analysis, implementing the in silico technique is beneficial for fast and more accurate results.", "In assessing food microbial safety, the presence of Escherichia coli is a critical indicator of fecal contamination. However, conventional detection methods require the isolation of bacterial macrocolonies for biochemical or genetic characterization, which takes a few days and is labor-intensive. In this study, we show that the real-time object detection and classification algorithm You Only Look Once version 4 (YOLOv4) can accurately identify the presence of E. coli at the microcolony stage after a 3-h cultivation. Integrating with phase-contrast microscopic imaging, YOLOv4 discriminated E. coli from seven other common foodborne bacterial species with an average precision of 94%. This approach also enabled the rapid quantification of E. coli concentrations over 3 orders of magnitude with an R2 of 0.995. For romaine lettuce spiked with E. coli (10 to 103 CFU/g), the trained YOLOv4 detector had a false-negative rate of less than 10%. This approach accelerates analysis and avoids manual result determination, which has the potential to be applied as a rapid and user-friendly bacterial sensing approach in food industries. IMPORTANCE A simple, cost-effective, and rapid method is desired to identify potential pathogen contamination in food products and thus prevent foodborne illnesses and outbreaks. This study combined artificial intelligence (AI) and optical imaging to detect bacteria at the microcolony stage within 3 h of inoculation. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming culture-based colony isolation and resource-intensive molecular approaches for bacterial identification. The approach developed in this study is broadly applicable for the identification of diverse bacterial species. In addition, this approach can be implemented in resource-limited areas, as it does not require expensive instruments and significantly trained human resources. This AI-assisted detection not only achieves high accuracy in bacterial classification but also provides the potential for automated bacterial detection, reducing labor workloads in food industries, environmental monitoring, and clinical settings.", "Previous studies on intelligence have demonstrated that higher abilities are associated with lower brain activation, indicating a higher neural efficiency. In other words, more able individuals use fewer brain resources. However, it is unclear whether the neural efficiency phenomenon also appears for mathematical performance, which is influenced by both domain-general giftedness and domain-specific competencies. Therefore, this study examined the effects of general giftedness (G) and excellence in mathematics (EM) on performance and brain activation while solving learning-based mathematical tasks that required translation from graphical to symbolic representations of functions. Overall, 118 high school students (aged 16-18) participated in the present study and were divided according to G and EM using a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 study design. Participants worked on a function task requiring translation between symbolic and graphical representations of functions. Analyses of the behavioral data revealed positive effects of both G and EM on the accuracy of solutions and an interaction effect of both factors on reaction times, reflecting a positive effect of EM only among the gifted individuals. EEG analyses focused on oscillatory activity in the theta and alpha frequency bands and showed a significant effect of EM in the upper alpha band (10-12\u00a0Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) for both graphical and symbolic representations. Specifically, higher (compared to lower) EM was associated with a larger alpha ERD, indicating a higher level of brain activity. This stands in contrast with the neural efficiency phenomenon. These findings suggest that the neural efficiency phenomenon cannot be generalized to higher-order mathematical demands in high-performing individuals. Several explanations for this limitation are offered.", "The curation of images using human resources is time intensive but an essential step for developing artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Our goal was to develop and implement an AI algorithm for image curation in a high-volume setting. We also explored AI tools that will assist in deploying a tiered approach, in which the AI model labels images and flags potential mislabels for human review.\nImplementation of an AI algorithm.\nSeven-field stereoscopic images from multiple clinical trials.\nThe 7-field stereoscopic image protocol includes 7 pairs of images from various parts of the central retina along with images of the anterior part of the eye. All images were labeled for field number by reading center graders. The model output included classification of the retinal images into 8 field numbers. Probability scores (0-1) were generated to identify misclassified images, with 1 indicating a high probability of a correct label.\nAgreement of AI prediction with grader classification of field number and the use of probability scores to identify mislabeled images.\nThe AI model was trained and validated on 17 529 images and tested on 3004 images. The pooled agreement of field numbers between grader classification and the AI model was 88.3% (kappa, 0.87). The pooled mean probability score was 0.97 (standard deviation [SD], 0.08) for images for which the graders agreed with the AI-generated labels and 0.77 (SD, 0.19) for images for which the graders disagreed with the AI-generated labels (P\u00a0< 0.0001). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, a probability score of 0.99 was identified as a cutoff for distinguishing mislabeled images. A tiered workflow using a probability score of < 0.99 as a cutoff would include 27.6% of the 3004 images for human review and reduce the error rate from 11.7% to 1.5%.\nThe implementation of AI algorithms requires measures in addition to model validation. Tools to flag potential errors in the labels generated by AI models will reduce inaccuracies, increase trust in the system, and provide data for continuous model development.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has grown tremendously in the past decade. The application of AI in teledentistry can reform the way dental care, dental education, research, and subsequent innovations can happen remotely. Machine learning including deep learning-based algorithms can be developed to create predictive models of risk assessment for oral health related conditions, consequent complications, and patient stratification. Patients can be empowered to self-diagnose and apply preventive measures or self-manage some early stages of dental diseases. Applications of AI in teledentistry can be beneficial for both, the dental surgeon and the patient. AI enables better remote screening, diagnosis, record keeping, triaging, and monitoring of dental patients based on smart devices. This will take away rudimentary cases requiring run-of-the-mill treatments from dentists and enable them to concentrate on highly complex cases. This would also enable the dentists to serve a larger and deprived population in inaccessible areas. Its usage in teledentistry can bring a paradigm shift from curative to preventive personalised approach in dentistry. A strong asset to teledentistry could be a robust and comprehensive feedback mechanism routed through various channels proposed in this paper. This paper discusses the application of AI in teledentistry and proposes a feedback mechanism to enhance performance in teledentistry.", "Established guidelines describe minimum requirements for reporting algorithms in healthcare; it is equally important to objectify the characteristics of ideal algorithms that confer maximum potential benefits to patients, clinicians, and investigators. We propose a framework for ideal algorithms, including 6 desiderata: explainable (convey the relative importance of features in determining outputs), dynamic (capture temporal changes in physiologic signals and clinical events), precise (use high-resolution, multimodal data and aptly complex architecture), autonomous (learn with minimal supervision and execute without human input), fair (evaluate and mitigate implicit bias and social inequity), and reproducible (validated externally and prospectively and shared with academic communities). We present an ideal algorithms checklist and apply it to highly cited algorithms. Strategies and tools such as the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework, the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence (SPIRIT-AI) extension, sparse regression methods, and minimizing concept drift can help healthcare algorithms achieve these objectives, toward ideal algorithms in healthcare.", "The Kenyan government has successfully been implementing sector specific and multisectoral projects aligned to the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). For operational readiness and to enhance the effective planning and implementation of Global Health Security Programs (GHSP) at national and subnational level, there is an urgent need for stakeholders' engagement process to seek input in identifying challenges, prioritise activities for field implementation, and identify applied research and development questions, that should be addressed in the next five years.\nThe modified Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method was used to identify global health security related priorities for multisectoral implementation in Kenya. Subject matter experts from human, animal and environmental health sectors at national and subnational level contributed to predefined research questions from a number of sources and activities for consideration for implementation using a One Health approach. Sixty-two experts scored the 193 questions based on five pre-defined criteria: 1) feasibility and answerability; 2) potential for burden reduction; 3) potential for a paradigm shift; 4) potential for translation and implementation; and 5) impact on equity. Data resulting from this process was then analysed in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to determine the research priorities and experts' agreements.\nAmong the priority activities identified for implementation research were; strengthening One Health governance and legal frameworks; integration of ecosystem health into One Health programming; strengthening disease reporting, integrated data collection, information sharing and joint outbreak response; socio-anthropological and gender-based approaches in improving risk and behavioural change communication and community engagement; and one health workforce development. In addition, the potentials to invest in collaborative predictive risk modelling to enhance epidemic intelligence systems, while strengthening the One Health approach in the food safety incident and emergency response plans are feasible.\nSuccessful multisectoral implementation of global health security program in Kenya calls for a whole of society approach that will harness community and private sector knowledge to build preparedness and response capacities while targeting neglected and marginalised populations. This research provides a framework that is worth emulating for cost-effective planning and implementation of overarching One Health programs.", "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections result in a series of ophthalmic complications. Clinically, we also discover that the proportion of dry eye symptoms was significantly higher in patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) than in healthy individuals. Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is one of the main reasons for dry eye. Therefore, we hypothesize that HZO may associate with MGD, affecting the morphology of meibomian gland (MG) because of immune response and inflammation. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze the effect of HZO with craniofacial herpes zoster on dry eye and MG morphology based on an Artificial intelligence (AI) MG morphology analytic system. In this study, 26 patients were diagnosed as HZO based on a history of craniofacial herpes zoster accompanied by abnormal ocular signs. We found that the average height of all MGs of the upper eyelid and both eyelids were significantly lower in the research group than in the normal control group (p < 0.05 for all). The average width and tortuosity of all MGs for both upper and lower eyelids were not significantly different between the two groups. The MG density of the upper eyelid and both eyelids were significantly lower in the HZO group than in the normal control group (p = 0.020 and p = 0.022). Therefore, HZO may lead to dry eye, coupled with the morphological changes of MGs, mainly including a reduction in MG density and height. Moreover, it is important to control HZO early and timely, which could prevent potential long-term severe ocular surface injury.", "This trial was designed to determine if artificial intelligence (AI)-supported diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening improved referral uptake in Rwanda.\nThe Rwanda Artificial Intelligence for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening (RAIDERS) study was an investigator-masked, parallel-group randomized controlled trial.\nPatients \u2265 18 years of age with known diabetes who required referral for DR based on AI interpretation.\nThe RAIDERS study screened for DR using retinal imaging with AI interpretation implemented at 4 facilities from March 2021 through July 2021. Eligible participants were assigned randomly (1:1) to immediate feedback of AI grading (intervention) or communication of referral advice after human grading was completed 3 to 5 days after the initial screening (control).\nDifference between study groups in the rate of presentation for referral services within 30 days of being informed of the need for a referral visit.\nOf the 823 clinic patients who met inclusion criteria, 275 participants (33.4%) showed positive findings for referable DR based on AI screening and were randomized for inclusion in the trial. Study participants (mean age, 50.7 years; 58.2% women) were randomized to the intervention (n\u00a0= 136 [49.5%]) or control (n\u00a0= 139 [50.5%]) groups. No significant intergroup differences were found at baseline, and main outcome data were available for analyses for 100% of participants. Referral adherence was statistically significantly higher in the intervention group (70/136 [51.5%]) versus the control group (55/139 [39.6%]; P\u00a0= 0.048), a 30.1% increase. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.05; P < 0.0001), male sex (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.22-3.51; P\u00a0= 0.007), rural residence (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.07-3.01; P\u00a0= 0.027), and intervention group (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.88; P\u00a0= 0.031) were statistically significantly associated with acceptance of referral in multivariate analyses.\nImmediate feedback on referral status based on AI-supported screening was associated with statistically significantly higher referral adherence compared with delayed communications of results from human graders. These results provide evidence for an important benefit of AI screening in promoting adherence to prescribed treatment for diabetic eye care in sub-Saharan Africa.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced explosive growth in oncology and related specialties in recent years. The improved expertise in data capture, the increased capacity for data aggregation and analytic power, along with decreasing costs of genome sequencing and related biologic \"omics\", set the foundation and need for novel tools that can meaningfully process these data from multiple sources and of varying types. These advances provide value across biomedical discovery, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention, in a multimodal fashion. However, while big data and AI tools have already revolutionized many fields, medicine has partially lagged due to its complexity and multi-dimensionality, leading to technical challenges in developing and validating solutions that generalize to diverse populations. Indeed, inner biases and miseducation of algorithms, in view of their implementation in daily clinical practice, are increasingly relevant concerns; critically, it is possible for AI to mirror the unconscious biases of the humans who generated these algorithms. Therefore, to avoid worsening existing health disparities, it is critical to employ a thoughtful, transparent, and inclusive approach that involves addressing bias in algorithm design and implementation along the cancer care continuum. In this review, a broad landscape of major applications of AI in cancer care is provided, with a focus on cancer research and precision medicine. Major challenges posed by the implementation of AI in the clinical setting will be discussed. Potentially feasible solutions for mitigating bias are provided, in the light of promoting cancer health equity.", "The nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) is one of NMR spectroscopy's most important and versatile parameters. NOE is routinely utilized to determine the structures of medium-to-large size biomolecules and characterize protein-protein, protein-RNA, protein-DNA, and protein-ligand interactions in aqueous solutions. Typical [1H,1H] NOESY pulse sequences incorporate water suppression schemes to reduce the water signal that dominates 1H-detected spectra and minimize NOE intensity losses due to unwanted polarization exchange between water and labile protons. However, at high- and ultra-high magnetic fields, the excitation of the water signal during the execution of the NOESY pulse sequences may cause significant attenuation of NOE cross-peak intensities. Using an evolutionary algorithm coupled with artificial intelligence, we recently designed high-fidelity pulses [Water irrAdiation DEvoid (WADE) pulses] that elude water excitation and irradiate broader bandwidths relative to commonly used pulses. Here, we demonstrate that WADE pulses, implemented into the 2D [1H,1H] NOESY experiments, increase the intensity of the NOE cross-peaks for labile and, to a lesser extent, non-exchangeable protons. We applied the new 2D [1H,1H] WADE-NOESY pulse sequence to two well-folded, medium-size proteins, i.e., the K48C mutant of ubiquitin and the Raf kinase inhibitor protein. We observed a net increase of the NOE intensities varying from 30 to 170% compared to the commonly used NOESY experiments. The new WADE pulses can be easily engineered into 2D and 3D homo- and hetero-nuclear NOESY pulse sequences to boost their sensitivity.", "During hospital relocations, it is important to support healthcare professionals becoming familiar with new settings. Simulation-based training seems promising and in situ simulation has been suggested as a beneficial educational tool to prepare healthcare professionals for relocation. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a simulation-based training intervention on health professionals\u00b4 readiness to work in their new environment, as well as investigate sick leave before and after relocation.\nThe study was a controlled intervention study implemented at a university hospital in Denmark. Simulation was used to prepare employees for workflows prior to relocation. Before relocation, 1199 healthcare professionals participated in the in situ simulation-based training program. Questionnaires on readiness to perform were distributed to participants at pre-, post-, and follow-up (6 months) measurement. In addition, data on participants' sick leave was gathered from a business intelligence portal. To compare dependent and independent groups, paired and unpaired t tests were performed on mean score of readiness to perform and sick leave.\nCompared to the control group, healthcare professionals participating in the intervention felt significantly more ready to work in a new hospital environment. As a measure of psychological wellbeing, register data indicated no difference in sick leave, when comparing intervention and control groups before and after participating in the in situ simulation-based training program.\nHealthcare professionals felt significantly more ready to work in a new environment, after participating in the in situ simulation-based training program, indicating that the intervention supported healthcare professionals during relocations. This may mitigate feelings of uncertainty; however, further research is needed to explore such effects.\nThe study was approved by The Regional Ethics Committee (no. 1-16-02-222-22).", "Artificial intelligence (AI) will affect almost every aspect of our lives and replace many of our jobs. On one view, machines are well suited to take over automated tasks and humans would remain important to creative endeavors. In this essay, I examine this view critically and consider the possibility that AI will play a significant role in a quintessential creative activity, the appreciation and production of visual art. This possibility is likely even though attributes typically important to viewers-the agency of the artist, the uniqueness of the art and its purpose might not be relevant to AI art. Additionally, despite the fact that art at its most powerful communicates abstract ideas and nuanced emotions, I argue that AI need not understand ideas or experience emotions to produce meaningful and evocative art. AI is and will increasingly be a powerful tool for artists. The continuing development of aesthetically sensitive machines will challenge our notions of beauty, creativity, and the nature of art.", "Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia, and impairments are present in groups at-risk for psychosis. Most at-risk studies include young adults and not younger age-groups, such as adolescents. Participants are usually help-seeking individuals, even though risk factors may also be present in non-help seeking adolescents. We aim to explore cognitive functions in a group of non-help-seeking 15-year-old adolescents at risk for psychosis compared to age- and gender matched controls, including particular focus on specific cognitive domains. Hundred participants (mean age = 15.3) were invited after completing the 14-year-old survey distributed by the Norwegian Mother-, Father- and Child Study. At-risk adolescents were selected based on high scores on 19 items assessing both psychotic experiences and anomalous self-experiences. Matched controls were selected from the same sample. Cognitive functioning was assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery and IQ using Wechsler's Abbreviated Test of Intelligence. We found that the adolescents at-risk for psychosis had significantly poorer scores than controls on the composite score of the MCCB. IQ scores were also significantly lower in the at-risk group. The results highlight general cognitive deficits as central in a group of non-help-seeking adolescents at-risk for psychosis. Results indicate that the development of cognitive impairments starts early in life in at-risk groups. It is still unclear whether specific cognitive domains, such as verbal learning, are related to psychotic symptoms or may be specifically vulnerable to symptoms of depression and anxiety.", "Future societal systems will be characterized by heterogeneous human behaviors and data-driven collective action. Complexity will arise as a consequence of the 5th Industrial Revolution and 2nd Data Revolution possible, thanks to a new generation of digital systems and the Metaverse. These technologies will enable new computational methods to tackle inequality while preserving individual rights and self-development. In this context, we do not only need data innovation and computational science, but also new forms of digital policy and governance. The emerging fragility or robustness of the system will depend on how complexity and governance are developed. Through data, humanity has been able to study a number of multi-scale systems from biological to migratory. Multi-scale governance is the new paradigm that feeds the Data Revolution in a world that would be highly digitalized. In the social dimension, we will encounter meta-populations sharing economy and human values. In the temporal dimension, we still need to make all real-time response, evaluation, and mitigation systems a standard integrated system into policy and governance to build up a resilient digital society. Top-down governance is not sufficient to manage all the complexities and exploit all the data available. Coordinating top-down agencies with bottom-up digital platforms will be the design principle. Digital platforms have to be built on top of data innovation and implement Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven systems to connect, compute, collaborate, and curate data to implement data-driven policy for sustainable development based on Collective Intelligence.", "Artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram has become a substitute tool for echocardiography in left ventricular ejection fraction estimation. However, the direct use of artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram may be not trustable due to the uncertainty of the prediction.\nThe study aimed to establish an artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram with a degree of confidence to identify left ventricular dysfunction.\nThe study collected 76,081 and 11,771 electrocardiograms from an academic medical center and a community hospital to establish and validate the deep learning model, respectively. The proposed deep learning model provided the point estimation of the actual ejection fraction and its standard deviation derived from the maximum probability density function of a normal distribution. The primary analysis focused on the accuracy of identifying patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction \u2264 40%). Since the standard deviation was an uncertainty indicator in a normal distribution, we used it as a degree of confidence in the artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram. We further explored the clinical application of estimated standard deviation and followed up on the new-onset left ventricular dysfunction in patients with initially normal ejection fraction.\nThe area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of detecting left ventricular dysfunction were 0.9549 and 0.9365 in internal and external validation sets. After excluding the cases with a lower degree of confidence, the artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram performed better in the remaining cases in internal (AUC\u2009=\u20090.9759) and external (AUC\u2009=\u20090.9653) validation sets. For the application of future left ventricular dysfunction risk stratification in patients with initially normal ejection fraction, a 4.57-fold risk of future left ventricular dysfunction when the artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram is positive in the internal validation set. The hazard ratio was increased to 8.67 after excluding the cases with a lower degree of confidence. This trend was also validated in the external validation set.\nThe deep learning model with a degree of confidence can provide advanced improvements in identifying left ventricular dysfunction and serve as a decision support and management-guided screening tool for prognosis.", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that affects millions of individuals around the world and for which there are few effective therapies. Dementia is characterized by the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which is followed by neurotoxicity, which results in memory loss and mortality. Pathogenesis occurs several years before the onset of disease. As the disease-modifying drugs are most effective in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, biomarkers for early detection of disease and their development are crucial. This review discusses the diagnostic utility, benefits, and limitations of traditional techniques such as neuroimaging, cognitive testing, positron emission tomography, and biomarkers, as well as the novel techniques such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, immunotherapy, and blood test approaches for early detection, understanding, and treatment of AD.", "To evaluate the performance of a deep learning (DL) algorithm for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening in Nepal and Mongolia.\nRetrospective analysis of prospectively collected clinical data.\nClinical information and fundus images were obtained from infants in 2 ROP screening programs in Nepal and Mongolia.\nFundus images were obtained using the Forus 3nethra neo (Forus Health) in Nepal and the RetCam Portable (Natus Medical, Inc.) in Mongolia. The overall severity of ROP was determined from the medical record using the International Classification of ROP (ICROP). The presence of plus disease was determined independently in each image using a reference standard diagnosis. The Imaging and Informatics for ROP (i-ROP) DL algorithm was trained on images from the RetCam to classify plus disease and to assign a vascular severity score (VSS) from 1 through\u00a09.\nArea under the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve for the presence of plus disease or type 1 ROP and association between VSS and ICROP disease category.\nThe prevalence of type 1 ROP was found to be higher in Mongolia (14.0%) than in Nepal (2.2%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in these data sets. In Mongolia (RetCam images), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for examination-level plus disease detection was 0.968, and the area under the precision-recall curve was 0.823. In Nepal (Forus images), these values were 0.999 and 0.993, respectively. The ROP VSS was associated with ICROP classification in both datasets (P < 0.001). At the population level, the median VSS was found to be higher in Mongolia (2.7; interquartile range [IQR], 1.3-5.4]) as compared with Nepal (1.9; IQR, 1.2-3.4; P < 0.001).\nThese data provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of the i-ROP DL algorithm for ROP screening in neonatal populations in Nepal and Mongolia using multiple camera systems and are useful for consideration in future clinical implementation of artificial intelligence-based ROP screening in low- and middle-income countries.", "Microbial-based strategy in nanotechnology offers economic, eco-friendly, and biosafety advantages over traditional chemical and physical protocols. The current study describes a novel biosynthesis protocol for chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs), employing a pioneer Streptomyces sp. strain NEAE-83, which exhibited a significant potential for CNPs biosynthesis. It was identified as Streptomyces microflavus strain NEAE-83 based on morphological, and physiological properties as well as the 16S rRNA sequence (GenBank accession number: MG384964). CNPs were characterized by SEM, TEM, EDXS, zeta potential, FTIR, XRD, TGA, and DSC. CNPs biosynthesis was maximized using a\u00a0mathematical\u00a0model, face-centered central composite design (CCFCD). The highest yield of CNPs (9.41 mg/mL) was obtained in run no. 27, using an\u00a0initial pH\u00a0of 5.5,\u00a01% chitosan, 40\u00a0\u00b0C, and a\u00a012\u00a0h incubation period. Innovatively, the artificial neural network (ANN), was used\u00a0for validating and predicting CNPs biosynthesis based on the trials data of CCFCD. Despite the high precision degree of both models, ANN was supreme in the prediction of CNPs biosynthesis compared to CCFCD. ANN had a higher prediction efficacy and, lower error values (RMSE, MDA, and SSE). CNPs biosynthesized by Streptomyces microflavus strain NEAE-83 showed in-vitro antibacterial activity against Pectobacterium carotovorum, which causes the potato soft rot. These results suggested its potential application for controlling the destructive potato soft rot diseases. This is the first report on the biosynthesis of CNPs using a\u00a0newly isolated; Streptomyces microflavus strain NEAE-83 as an eco-friendly approach and optimization of the biosynthesis process by artificial intelligence.", "With advances in next-generation sequencing technology, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has been widely implemented to detect fetal aneuploidies, including trisomy 21, 18, and 13 (T21, T18, and T13). Most NIPT methods use cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragment count (FC) in maternal blood. In this study, we developed a novel NIPT method using cfDNA fragment distance (FD) and convolutional neural network-based artificial intelligence algorithm (aiD-NIPT). Four types of aiD-NIPT algorithm (mean, median, interquartile range, and its ensemble) were developed using 2,215 samples. In an analysis of 17,678 clinical samples, all algorithms showed >99.40% accuracy for T21/T18/T13, and the ensemble algorithm showed the best performance (sensitivity: 99.07%, positive predictive value (PPV): 88.43%); the FC-based conventional Z-score and normalized chromosomal value showed 98.15% sensitivity, with 40.77% and 36.81% PPV, respectively. In conclusion, FD-based aiD-NIPT was successfully developed, and it showed better performance than FC-based NIPT methods.", "The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) are both widely used global classification systems. In 2018, the initial release of the ICD-11 was published by the World Health Organization (WHO), integrating the morphology section of the ICD-O.\nThis paper aims to provide potential ICD-11 users with a profound understanding of the neoplasm classifications of the ICD-11 by analysing the differences and relationships between the ICD-11 and ICD-O in terms of the coding framework, compatibility and intelligence level.\nThe ICD-11 and ICD-O have remarkable differences in coding structure. Compared to the ICD-O, the ICD-11 has the following advantages: adding histopathology to the stem codes, obtaining a meaningful minimum amount of information through stem codes for statistics, supporting the usage of ICD-O morphology categories and capturing clinical details via extension codes for multiaxial coding. In addition, the rich Foundation Component, linearization derived from the Foundation Component and updating mechanism all support the compatibility of the ICD-11 with other classification systems. Notably, the WHO provides terminology coding with a smart coding tool, and coding\u00a0in the ICD-11 can draw on statistical codes and uniform resource identifiers (URIs) simultaneously.\nThe ICD-11 represents a novel classification system with distinguishing features that include facilitating statistics, multiaxial coding, coding granularity, compatibility and intelligence. These features enable the ICD-11 to be more powerful for neoplasm coding than the ICD-O and basically meet the needs of stakeholders.", "Several studies have used artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze cytology images, but AI has yet to be adopted in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the accuracy of AI-based image analysis for thyroid fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and to propose its application in clinical practice.\nIn total, 148,395 microscopic images of FNAC were obtained from 393 thyroid nodules to train and validate the data, and EfficientNetV2-L was used as the image-classification model. The 35 nodules that were classified as atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) were predicted using AI training.\nThe precision-recall area under the curve (PR AUC) was >0.95, except for poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PR AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.49) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (PR AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.91). Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma had the lowest recall (35.4%) and was difficult to distinguish from papillary thyroid carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and follicular thyroid carcinoma. Follicular adenomas and follicular thyroid carcinomas were distinguished from each other by 86.7% and 93.9% recall, respectively. For two-dimensional mapping of the data using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, the lymphomas, follicular adenomas, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas were divided into three, two, and two groups, respectively. Analysis of the AUS nodules showed 94.7% sensitivity, 14.4% specificity, 56.3% positive predictive value, and 66.7% negative predictive value.\nThe authors developed an AI-based approach to analyze thyroid FNAC cases encountered in routine practice. This analysis could be useful for the clinical management of AUS and follicular neoplasm nodules (e.g., an online AI platform for thyroid cytology consultations).", "The Ulaanbaatar Gestation and Air Pollution Research (UGAAR) study is a randomized controlled trial of the effects of portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air cleaner use during pregnancy on fetal growth and child health outcomes. A challenge with the study is that the outcome variables cannot be measured in the absence of a live birth. Thus pregnancy loss is a competing event for the outcome variables that can obscure the intervention-outcome relationship. This phenomenon is called \"live birth bias\" in the epidemiological literature, and it is an example of selection bias due to adjustment for variables affected by previous exposure.\nIn this investigation, we reanalyzed data from the UGAAR study and examined the impacts of the intervention on three health outcomes: preterm birth (PTB), birth weight, and full-scale IQ (FSIQ) measured with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence III when children were four years old, while accounting for live birth bias. Specifically, we used a novel multiple imputation approach to simulate scenarios in which pregnancy losses had instead been born alive and experienced a range of health outcomes.\nAfter accounting for live birth bias, the association between the intervention and PTB diminished. Additionally, the magnitude of intervention effect on birth weight and FSIQ increased. FSIQ was less sensitive to live birth bias than birth weight.\nWe introduced a novel analysis approach to examine the role of live birth bias, and the findings will be useful in environmental epidemiology studies of birth cohorts.", "Safety training enhances hazard awareness in the construction industry. Its effectiveness is a component of occupational safety and health. While face-to-face safety training has dominated in the past, the frequent lockdowns during COVID-19 have led us to rethink new solutions. A chatbot is messaging software that allows people to interact, obtain answers, and handle sales and inquiries through a computer algorithm. While chatbots have been used for language education, no study has investigated their usefulness for hazard awareness enhancement after chatbot training. In this regard, we developed four Telegram chatbots for construction safety training and designed the experiment as the treatment factor. Previous researchers utilized eye-tracking in the laboratory for construction safety research; most have adopted it for qualitative analyses such as heat maps or gaze plots to study visual paths or search strategies via eye-trackers, which only studied the impact of one factor. Our research has utilized an artificial intelligence-based eye-tracking tool. As hazard awareness can be affected by several factors, we filled this research void using 2-way interaction terms using the design of experiment (DOE) model. We designed an eye-tracking experiment to study the impact of site experience, Telegram chatbot safety training, and task complexity on hazard awareness, which is the first of its kind. The results showed that Telegram chatbot training enhanced the hazard awareness of participants with less onsite experience and in less complex scenarios. Low-cost chatbot safety training could improve site workers' danger awareness, but the design needs to be adjusted according to participants' experience. Our results offer insights to construction safety managers in safety knowledge sharing and safety training.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have demonstrated impressive performance across a variety of clinical tasks. However, notoriously, sometimes these systems are \"black boxes.\" The initial response in the literature was a demand for \"explainable AI.\" However, recently, several authors have suggested that making AI more explainable or \"interpretable\" is likely to be at the cost of the accuracy of these systems and that prioritizing interpretability in medical AI may constitute a \"lethal prejudice.\" In this article, we defend the value of interpretability in the context of the use of AI in medicine. Clinicians may prefer interpretable systems over more accurate black boxes, which in turn is sufficient to give designers of AI reason to prefer more interpretable systems in order to ensure that AI is adopted and its benefits realized. Moreover, clinicians may be justified in this preference. Achieving the downstream benefits from AI is critically dependent on how the outputs of these systems are interpreted by physicians and patients. A preference for the use of highly accurate black box AI systems, over less accurate but more interpretable systems, may itself constitute a form of lethal prejudice that may diminish the benefits of AI to-and perhaps even harm-patients.", "Premature born infants or infants born sick require immediate medical attention and decreasing the stress imposed onto their body by the environment. Infant incubators provide an enclosed environment that can be controlled to fit the needs of the infant. As such, their performance must be consistent and without significant deviations. The only manner to ensure this is by post-market surveillance (PMS) focused on evaluation of both safety and performance.

Four hundred and thirty-one AI research related to the field of nursing was published by 855 institutions from 54 countries. CIN-Computers Informatics Nursing was the top productive journal. The United States was the dominant country. The transnational cooperation between authors from developed countries was closer than that between authors from developing countries. The main hot topics included nurse rostering, nursing diagnosis, nursing decision support, disease risk factor prediction, nursing big data management, expert system, support vector machine, decision tree, deep learning, natural language processing, and nursing education. Machine learning represented one of the cutting-edge and most applicable branches of artificial intelligence in the field of nursing, and deep learning was the hottest technology among many machine learning methods in recent years. One of the most cited papers was published by Burke in 2004 and cited 500 times, which critically evaluated AI methods to deal with nurse scheduling problems.\nAlthough AI has been paid more and more attention to the field of nursing, there is still a lack of high-yielding authors who have been engaged in this field for a long time. Most of the high contribution authors and institutions came from developed countries; therefore, more transnational and multi-disciplinary cooperation is needed to promote the development of AI in the nursing field. This bibliometric analysis not only provided a comprehensive overview to help researchers to understand the important articles, journals, potential collaborators, and institutions in this field but also analyzed the history, hot spots, and future trends of the research topic to provide inspiration for researchers to choose research directions.", "Defibrillators are medical devices (MDs) used in the most critical situations, hence their performance must be ensured at all times.

High expectations surround the use of AI technologies, such as improvements for diagnosis and increases in the quality of care with reductions in health care costs. The successful development and testing of new AI algorithms require large amounts of high-quality data. Academic hospitals could provide the data needed for AI development, but granting legal, controlled, and regulated access to these data for developers and researchers is difficult. Therefore, the German Federal Ministry of Health supports the Protected Artificial Intelligence Innovation Environment for Patient-Oriented Digital Health Solutions for Developing, Testing, and Evidence-Based Evaluation of Clinical Value (pAItient) project, aiming to install the AI Innovation Environment at the Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany. The AI Innovation Environment was designed as a proof-of-concept extension of the already existing Medical Data Integration Center. It will establish a process to support every step of developing and testing AI-based technologies.\nThe first part of the pAItient project, as presented in this research protocol, aims to explore stakeholders' requirements for developing AI in partnership with an academic hospital and granting AI experts access to anonymized personal health data.\nWe planned a multistep mixed methods approach. In the first step, researchers and employees from stakeholder organizations were invited to participate in semistructured interviews. In the following step, questionnaires were developed based on the participants' answers and distributed among the stakeholders' organizations to quantify qualitative findings and discover important aspects that were not mentioned by the interviewees. The questionnaires will be analyzed descriptively. In addition, patients and physicians were interviewed as well. No survey questionnaires were developed for this second group of participants. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Heidelberg University Hospital (approval number: S-241/2021).\nData collection concluded in summer 2022. Data analysis is planned to start in fall 2022. We plan to publish the results in winter 2022 to 2023.\nThe results of our study will help in shaping the AI Innovation Environment at our academic hospital according to stakeholder requirements. With this approach, in turn, we aim to shape an AI environment that is effective and is deemed acceptable by all parties.\nDERR1-10.2196/42208.", "The predominant oncologist-led model in many countries is unsustainable to meet the needs of a growing cohort of breast cancer survivors (BCS). Despite available alternative models, adoption rates have been poor. To help BCS navigate survivorship care, we aimed to systematically develop a decision aid (DA) to guide their choice of follow-up care model and evaluate its acceptability and usability among BCS and health care providers (HCPs).\nWe recruited BCS aged\u2009\u2265\u200921\u00a0years who have completed primary treatment and understand English. BCS receiving palliative care or with cognitive impairment were excluded. HCPs who routinely discussed post-treatment care with BCS were purposively sampled based on disciplines. Each participant reviewed the DA during a semi-structured interview using the 'think aloud' approach and completed an acceptability questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and directed content analysis were used.\nWe conducted three rounds of alpha testing with 15 BCS and 8 HCPs. All BCS found the final DA prototype easy to navigate with sufficient interactivity. The information imbalance favouring the shared care option perceived by 60% of BCS in early rounds was rectified. The length of DA was optimized to be 'just right'. Key revisions made included (1) presenting care options side-by-side to improve perceived information balance, (2) creating dedicated sections explaining HCPs' care roles to address gaps in health system contextual knowledge, and (3) employing a multicriteria decision analysis method for preference clarification exercise to reflect the user's openness towards shared care. Most BCS (73%) found the DA useful for decision-making, and 93% were willing to discuss the DA with their HCPs. Most HCPs (88%) agreed that the DA was a reliable tool and would be easily integrated into routine care.\nOur experience highlighted the need to provide contextual information on the health care system for decisions related to care delivery. Developers should address potential variability within the care model and clarify inherent biases, such as low confidence levels in primary care. Future work could expand on the developed DA's informational structure to apply to other care models and leverage artificial intelligence to optimize information delivery.", "Embracing a growth mindset is essential to students' academic improvement. This manuscript aims to better understand the existing literature on the role and effects of the growth mindset in mathematics teaching and learning. It provides an updated perspective on the research regarding the growth mindset in mathematics education. The dataset comprises 85 journal articles published from 2012 to 2022 retrieved from the Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus databases. The current study applies a methodology based on bibliometric analysis techniques. The analysis reveals and corroborates several patterns from the research trends, journals, countries, and authors that have significant impacts on the research field. The findings show that USA, UK, and Norway are the most productive countries in publishing research on the topic. Moreover, the results of the thematic analysis indicate that the topics discussed among most of the articles in the dataset include engagement, implementation, persistence, children, fluid intelligence, and skills. The longitudinal trends in research themes based on study keywords illustrate an evolution in the research from the concept of mindsets to implicit theories on the growth mindset alongside academic achievement. Lastly, this study also provides an overview of the conceptual structure underlying studies on the growth mindset, which offers valuable insights into potential research topics for academics and practitioners seeking to explore the growth mindset in the future.", "Since 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an extremely high impact on all facets of the society and will potentially have an everlasting impact for years to come. In response to this, over the past years, there have been a significant number of research efforts on exploring approaches to combat COVID-19. In this paper, we present a survey of the current research efforts on using mobile Internet of Thing (IoT) devices, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and telemedicine for COVID-19 detection and prediction. We first present the background and then present current research in this field. Specifically, we present the research on COVID-19 monitoring and detection, contact tracing, machine learning based approaches, telemedicine, and security. We finally discuss the challenges and the future work that lay ahead in this field before concluding this paper.", "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a routinely used technique to quantify the gene expression profile of thousands of single cells simultaneously. Analysis of scRNA-seq data plays an important role in the study of cell states and phenotypes, and has helped elucidate biological processes, such as those occurring during the development of complex organisms, and improved our understanding of disease states, such as cancer, diabetes, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Deep learning, a recent advance of artificial intelligence that has been used to address many problems involving large datasets, has also emerged as a promising tool for scRNA-seq data analysis, as it has a capacity to extract informative and compact features from noisy, heterogeneous, and high-dimensional scRNA-seq data to improve downstream analysis. The present review aims at surveying recently developed deep learning techniques in scRNA-seq data analysis, identifying key steps within the scRNA-seq data analysis pipeline that have been advanced by deep learning, and explaining the benefits of deep learning over more conventional analytic tools. Finally, we summarize the challenges in current deep learning approaches faced within scRNA-seq data and discuss potential directions for improvements in deep learning algorithms for scRNA-seq data analysis.", "Massively parallel sequencing can provide genetic data for hundreds to thousands of loci in a single assay for various types of forensic testing. However, available commercial kits require an initial PCR amplification of short-to-medium sized targets which limits their application for highly degraded DNA. Development and optimisation of large PCR multiplexes also prevents creation of custom panels that target different suites of markers for identity, biogeographic ancestry, phenotype, and lineage markers (Y-chromosome and mtDNA). Hybridisation enrichment, an alternative approach for target enrichment prior to sequencing, uses biotinylated probes to bind to target DNA and has proven successful on degraded and ancient DNA. We developed a customisable hybridisation capture method, that uses individually mixed baits to allow tailored and targeted enrichment to specific forensic questions of interest. To allow collection of forensic intelligence data, we assembled and tested a custom panel of hybridisation baits to infer biogeographic ancestry, hair and eye colour, and paternal lineage (and sex) on modern male and female samples with a range of self-declared ancestries and hair/eye colour combinations. The panel correctly estimated biogeographic ancestry in 9/12 samples (75%) but detected European admixture in three individuals from regions with admixed demographic history. Hair and eye colour were predicted correctly in 83% and 92% of samples respectively, where intermediate eye colour and blond hair were problematic to predict. Analysis of Y-chromosome SNPs correctly assigned sex and paternal haplogroups, the latter complementing and supporting biogeographic ancestry predictions. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of this hybridisation enrichment approach to forensic intelligence testing using a combined suite of biogeographic ancestry, phenotype, and Y-chromosome SNPs for comprehensive biological profiling.", "A long standing challenge in biological and artificial intelligence is to understand how new knowledge can be constructed from known building blocks in a way that is amenable for computation by neuronal circuits. Here we focus on the task of storage and recall of structured knowledge in long-term memory. Specifically, we ask how recurrent neuronal networks can store and retrieve multiple knowledge structures. We model each structure as a set of binary relations between events and attributes (attributes may represent e.g., temporal order, spatial location, role in semantic structure), and map each structure to a distributed neuronal activity pattern using a vector symbolic architecture scheme.We then use associative memory plasticity rules to store the binarized patterns as fixed points in a recurrent network. By a combination of signal-to-noise analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our model allows for efficient storage of these knowledge structures, such that the memorized structures as well as their individual building blocks (e.g., events and attributes) can be subsequently retrieved from partial retrieving cues. We show that long-term memory of structured knowledge relies on a new principle of computation beyond the memory basins. Finally, we show that our model can be extended to store sequences of memories as single attractors.", "Therapeutic ultrasounds are medical devices used for treatment of conditions such muscle spasms, joint contractures or general muscle pain. Their function relies in the delivery of ultrasonic pulses that generate heat in tissue thus relieving the symptoms of aforementioned conditions. Accuracy of the delivered pulses directly affects the quality and effectiveness of the treatment and has to be ensured throughout the utilization of the therapeutic ultrasound in practice. The new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) defines medical device post-market surveillance (PMS) as performed by independent, third-party, notified bodies more strategically in hope to improve traceability of device performance. However, there is still an apparent gap in terms of standardised conformity assessment testing methods.\nThis paper proposes a novel method for conformity assessment testing of therapeutic ultrasounds for post-market surveillance purposes.\nThe method was developed based on metrology characteristics of therapeutic ultrasounds and includes visual, electrical safety and performance inspections of therapeutic ultrasounds to ensure that both safety and treatment reliability are achieved.\nThe developed method was validated between 2018 and 2021 in healthcare institutions of all levels. The results obtained during validation suggest that conformity assessment testing of therapeutic ultrasounds as a method used during PMS contributes to significant improvement in devices' accuracy and reliability.\nA standardized approach in conformity assessment testing of therapeutic ultrasounds during PMS, besides increasing reliability of the devices, is the first step in digital transformation of management of these devices in healthcare institutions opening possibility for use of artificial intelligence.", "Protocolling, the process of determining the most appropriate acquisition parameters for an imaging study, is time-consuming and produces variable results depending on the performing physician. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of an artificial intelligence-based semiautomated tool in reducing the workload and decreasing unwarranted variation in the protocolling process.\nWe collected 19,721 MR imaging brain examinations at a large academic medical center. Criterion standard labels were created using physician consensus. A model based on the Long Short-Term Memory network was trained to predict the most appropriate protocol for any imaging request. The model was modified into a clinical decision support tool in which high-confidence predictions, determined by the values the model assigns to each possible choice, produced the best protocol automatically and low confidence predictions provided a shortened list of protocol choices for review.\nThe model achieved 90.5% accuracy in predicting the criterion standard labels and demonstrated higher agreement than the original protocol assignments, which achieved 85.9% accuracy (\u03ba = 0.84 versus 0.72, P value < .001). As a clinical decision support tool, the model automatically assigned 70% of protocols with 97.3% accuracy and, for the remaining 30% of examinations, achieved 94.7% accuracy when providing the top 2 protocols.\nOur model achieved high accuracy on a standard based on physician consensus. It showed promise as a clinical decision support tool to reduce the workload by automating the protocolling of a sizeable portion of examinations while maintaining high accuracy for the remaining examinations.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are currently used in several areas. The applications of AI and ML based models are also reported for monitoring and design of biological wastewater treatment systems (WWTS). The available information is reviewed and presented in terms of bibliometric analysis, model's description, specific applications, and major findings for investigated WWTS. Among the applied models, artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL) algorithms, random forest (RF), and long short-term memory (LSTM) were predominantly used in the biological wastewater treatment. These models are tested by predictive control of effluent parameters such as biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), nutrient parameters, solids, and metallic substances. Following model performance indicators were mainly used for the accuracy analysis in most of the studies: root mean squared error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), and determination coefficient (DC). Besides, outcomes of various models are also summarized in this study.", "Deep learning models are currently the cornerstone of artificial intelligence in medical imaging. While progress is still being made, the generic technological core of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has had only modest innovations over the last several years, if at all. There is thus a need for improvement. More recently, transformer networks have emerged that replace convolutions with a complex attention mechanism, and they have already matched or exceeded the performance of CNNs in many tasks. Transformers need very large amounts of training data, even more than CNNs, but obtaining well-curated labeled data is expensive and difficult. A possible solution to this issue would be transfer learning with pretraining on a self-supervised task using very large amounts of unlabeled medical data. This pretrained network could then be fine-tuned on specific medical imaging tasks with relatively modest data requirements. The authors believe that the availability of a large-scale, three-dimension-capable, and extensively pretrained transformer model would be highly beneficial to the medical imaging and research community. In this article, authors discuss the challenges and obstacles of training a very large medical imaging transformer, including data needs, biases, training tasks, network architecture, privacy concerns, and computational requirements. The obstacles are substantial but not insurmountable for resourceful collaborative teams that may include academia and information technology industry partners. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022 Keywords: Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD), Informatics, Transfer Learning, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).", "Digital health solutions that operate with or without artificial intelligence (D/AI) raise several responsibility challenges. Though many frameworks and tools have been developed, determining what principles should be translated into practice remains under debate. This scoping review aims to provide policymakers with a rigorous body of knowledge by asking: 1) what kinds of practice-oriented tools are available?; 2) on what principles do they predominantly rely?; and 3) what are their limitations?\nWe searched six academic and three grey literature databases for practice-oriented tools, defined as frameworks and/or sets of principles with clear operational explanations, published in English or French from 2015 to 2021. Characteristics of the tools were qualitatively coded and variations across the dataset identified through descriptive statistics and a network analysis.\nA total of 56 tools met our inclusion criteria: 19 health-specific tools (33.9%) and 37 generic tools (66.1%). They adopt a normative (57.1%), reflective (35.7%), operational (3.6%), or mixed approach (3.6%) to guide developers (14.3%), managers (16.1%), end users (10.7%), policymakers (5.4%) or multiple groups (53.6%). The frequency of 40 principles varies greatly across tools (from 0% for 'environmental sustainability' to 83.8% for 'transparency'). While 50% or more of the generic tools promote up to 19 principles, 50% or more of the health-specific tools promote 10 principles, and 50% or more of all tools disregard 21 principles. In contrast to the scattered network of principles proposed by academia, the business sector emphasizes closely connected principles. Few tools rely on a formal methodology (17.9%).\nDespite a lack of consensus, there is a solid knowledge-basis for policymakers to anchor their role in such a dynamic field. Because several tools lack rigour and ignore key social, economic, and environmental issues, an integrated and methodologically sound approach to responsibility in D/AI solutions is warranted.", "Artificial intelligence could enhance the use of disparate risk factors (crude method) for better stratification of patients to be screened for oral cancer. This study aims to construct a meta-classifier that considers diverse risk factors to identify patients at risk of oral cancer and other suspicious oral diseases for targeted screening.\nA retrospective dataset from a community oral cancer screening program was used to construct and train the novel voting meta-classifier. Comprehensive risk factor information from this dataset was used as input features for eleven supervised learning algorithms which served as base learners and provided predicted probabilities that are weighted and aggregated by the meta-classifier. Training dataset was augmented using SMOTE-ENN. Additionally, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values were generated to implement the explainability of the model and display the important risk factors.\nOur meta-classifier had an internal validation recall, specificity, and AUROC of 0.83, 0.86, and 0.85 for identifying the risk of oral cancer and 0.92, 0.60, and 0.76 for identifying suspicious oral mucosal disease respectively. Upon external validation, the meta-classifier had a significantly higher AUROC than the crude/current method used for identifying the risk of oral cancer (0.78 vs 0.46; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) Also, the meta-classifier had better recall than the crude method for predicting the risk of suspicious oral mucosal diseases (0.78 vs 0.47).\nOverall, these findings showcase that our approach optimizes the use of risk factors in identifying patients for oral screening which suggests potential clinical application.", "Colorectal and gastric cancer are major causes of cancer-related deaths. In Korea, gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic biopsy specimens account for a high percentage of histopathologic examinations. Lack of a sufficient pathologist workforce can cause an increase in human errors, threatening patient safety. Therefore, we developed a digital pathology total solution combining artificial intelligence (AI) classifier models and pathology laboratory information system for GI endoscopic biopsy specimens to establish a post-analytic daily fast quality control (QC) system, which was applied in clinical practice for a 3-month trial run by four pathologists.\nOur whole slide image (WSI) classification framework comprised patch-generator, patch-level classifier, and WSI-level classifier. The classifiers were both based on DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network). In laboratory tests, the WSI classifier achieved accuracy rates of 95.8% and 96.0% in classifying histopathological WSIs of colorectal and gastric endoscopic biopsy specimens, respectively, into three classes (Negative for dysplasia, Dysplasia, and Malignant). Classification by pathologic diagnosis and AI prediction were compared and daily reviews were conducted, focusing on discordant cases for early detection of potential human errors by the pathologists, allowing immediate correction, before the pathology report error is conveyed to the patients. During the 3-month AI-assisted daily QC trial run period, approximately 7-10 times the number of slides compared to that in the conventional monthly QC (33 months) were reviewed by pathologists; nearly 100% of GI endoscopy biopsy slides were double-checked by the AI models. Further, approximately 17-30 times the number of potential human errors were detected within an average of 1.2 days.\nThe AI-assisted daily QC system that we developed and established demonstrated notable improvements in QC, in quantitative, qualitative, and time utility aspects. Ultimately, we developed an independent AI-assisted post-analytic daily fast QC system that was clinically applicable and influential, which could enhance patient safety.", "Cerebral cortical representation of motor kinematics is crucial for understanding human motor behavior, potentially extending to efficient control of the brain-computer interface. Numerous single-neuron studies have found the existence of a relationship between neuronal activity and motor kinematics such as acceleration, velocity, and position. Despite differences between kinematic characteristics, it is hard to distinguish neural representations of these kinematic characteristics with macroscopic functional images such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The reason might be because cortical signals are not sensitive enough to segregate kinematic characteristics due to their limited spatial and temporal resolution. Considering different roles of each cortical area in producing movement, there might be a specific cortical representation depending on characteristics of acceleration, velocity, and position. Recently, neural network modeling has been actively pursued in the field of decoding. We hypothesized that neural features of each kinematic parameter could be identified with a high-performing model for decoding with an explainable AI method. Time-series deep neural network (DNN) models were used to measure the relationship between cortical activity and motor kinematics during reaching movement. With DNN models, kinematic parameters of reaching movement in a 3D space were decoded based on cortical source activity obtained from MEG data. An explainable artificial intelligence (AI) method was then adopted to extract the map of cortical areas, which strongly contributed to decoding each kinematics from DNN models. We found that there existed differed as well as shared cortical areas for decoding each kinematic attribute. Shared areas included bilateral supramarginal gyri and superior parietal lobules known to be related to the goal of movement and sensory integration. On the other hand, dominant areas for each kinematic parameter (the contralateral motor cortex for acceleration, the contralateral parieto-frontal network for velocity, and bilateral visuomotor areas for position) were mutually exclusive. Regarding the visuomotor reaching movement, the motor cortex was found to control the muscle force, the parieto-frontal network encoded reaching movement from sensory information, and visuomotor areas computed limb and gaze coordination in the action space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to discriminate kinematic cortical areas using DNN models and explainable AI.", "Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) sustained during contact sports like amateur boxing are found to have long-term sequelae, being linked to an increased risk of developing neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease. The aim of this study was to assess differences in volume of anatomical brain structures between amateur boxers and control subjects with a\u00a0special interest in the affection of deep grey matter structures.\nA total of 19 amateur boxers and 19\u00a0healthy controls (HC), matched for age and intelligence quotient (IQ), underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as neuropsychological testing. Body mass index (BMI) was evaluated for every subject and data about years of boxing training and number of fights were collected for each boxer. The acquired 3D high resolution T1 weighted MR images were analyzed to measure the volumes of cortical grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and deep grey matter structures. Multivariate analysis was applied to reveal differences between groups referencing deep grey matter structures to normalized brain volume (NBV) to adjust for differences in head size and brain volume as well as adding BMI as cofactor.\nTotal intracranial volume (TIV), comprising GM, WM and CSF, was lower in boxers compared to controls (by 7.1%, P\u202f=\u20090.009). Accordingly, GM (by 5.5%, P\u202f=\u20090.038) and WM (by 8.4%, P\u202f=\u20090.009) were reduced in boxers. Deep grey matter showed statistically lower volumes of the thalamus (by 8.1%, P\u202f=\u20090.006), caudate nucleus (by 11.1%, P\u202f=\u20090.004), putamen (by 8.1%, P\u202f=\u20090.011), globus pallidus (by 9.6%, P\u202f=\u20090.017) and nucleus accumbens (by 13.9%, P\u202f=\u20090.007) but not the amygdala (by 5.5%, P\u202f=\u20090.221), in boxers compared to HC.\nSeveral deep grey matter structures were reduced in volume in the amateur boxer group. Furthermore, longitudinal studies are needed to determine the damage pattern affecting deep grey matter structures and its neuropsychological relevance.", "Unreliable predictions can occur when an artificial intelligence (AI) system is presented with data it has not been exposed to during training. We demonstrate the use of conformal prediction to detect unreliable predictions, using histopathological diagnosis and grading of prostate biopsies as example. We digitized 7788 prostate biopsies from 1192 men in the STHLM3 diagnostic study, used for training, and 3059 biopsies from 676 men used for testing. With conformal prediction, 1 in 794 (0.1%) predictions is incorrect for cancer diagnosis (compared to 14 errors [2%] without conformal prediction) while 175 (22%) of the predictions are flagged as unreliable when the AI-system is presented with new data from the same lab and scanner that it was trained on. Conformal prediction could with small samples (N\u2009=\u200949 for external scanner, N\u2009=\u200910 for external lab and scanner, and N\u2009=\u200912 for external lab, scanner and pathology assessment) detect systematic differences in external data leading to worse predictive performance. The AI-system with conformal prediction commits 3 (2%) errors for cancer detection in cases of atypical prostate tissue compared to 44 (25%) without conformal prediction, while the system flags 143 (80%) unreliable predictions. We conclude that conformal prediction can increase patient safety of AI-systems.", "Bronchoscopy is a key step in the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory diseases. However, the level of expertise varies among different bronchoscopists. Artificial intelligence (AI) may help them identify bronchial lumens. Thus, a bronchoscopy quality-control system based on AI was built to improve the performance of bronchoscopists.\nThis single-center observational study consecutively collected bronchoscopy videos from Shanghai Chest Hospital and segmented each video into 31 different anatomical locations to develop an AI-assisted system based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. We then designed a single-center trial to compare the accuracy of lumen recognition by bronchoscopists with and without the assistance of the AI system.\nA total of 28,441 qualified images of bronchial lumen were used to train the CNNs. In the cross-validation set, the optimal accuracy of the six models was between 91.83% and 96.62%. In the test set, the visual geometry group 16 (VGG-16) achieved optimal performance with an accuracy of 91.88%, and an area under the curve of 0.995. In the clinical evaluation, the accuracy rate of the AI system alone was 54.30% (202/372). For the identification of bronchi except for segmental bronchi, the accuracy was 82.69% (129/156). In group 1, the recognition accuracy rates of doctors A, B, a and b alone were 42.47%, 34.68%, 28.76%, and 29.57%, respectively, but increased to 57.53%, 54.57%, 54.57%, and 46.24% respectively when combined with the AI system. Similarly, in group 2, the recognition accuracy rates of doctors C, D, c, and d were 37.90%, 41.40%, 30.91%, and 33.60% respectively, but increased to 51.61%, 47.85%, 53.49%, and 54.30% respectively, when combined with the AI system. Except for doctor D, the accuracy of doctors in recognizing lumen was significantly higher with AI assistance than without AI assistance, regardless of their experience (P<0.001).\nOur AI system could better recognize bronchial lumen and reduce differences in the operation levels of different bronchoscopists. It could be used to improve the quality of everyday bronchoscopies.", "A majority of BCI systems, enabling communication with patients with locked-in syndrome, are based on electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency analysis (e.g., linked to motor imagery) or P300 detection. Only recently, the use of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) has received much attention, especially for face or music recognition, but neuro-engineering research into this new approach has not been carried out yet. The aim of this study was to provide a variety of reliable ERP markers of visual and auditory perception for the development of new and more complex mind-reading systems for reconstructing the mental content from brain activity.\nA total of 30 participants were shown 280 color pictures (adult, infant, and animal faces; human bodies; written words; checkerboards; and objects) and 120 auditory files (speech, music, and affective vocalizations). This paradigm did not involve target selection to avoid artifactual waves linked to decision-making and response preparation (e.g., P300 and motor potentials), masking the neural signature of semantic representation. Overall, 12,000 ERP waveforms \u00d7 126 electrode channels (1 million 512,000 ERP waveforms) were processed and artifact-rejected.\nClear and distinct category-dependent markers of perceptual and cognitive processing were identified through statistical analyses, some of which were novel to the literature. Results are discussed from the view of current knowledge of ERP functional properties and with respect to machine learning classification methods previously applied to similar data.\nThe data showed a high level of accuracy (p \u2264 0.01) in the discriminating the perceptual categories eliciting the various electrical potentials by statistical analyses. Therefore, the ERP markers identified in this study could be significant tools for optimizing BCI systems [pattern recognition or artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms] applied to EEG/ERP signals.", "Loss of adipose tissue in vertebrate wildlife species is indicative of decreased nutritional and health status and is linked to environmental stress and diseases. Body condition indices (BCI) are commonly used in ecological studies to estimate adipose tissue mass across wildlife populations. However, these indices have poor predictive power, which poses the need for quantitative methods for improved population assessments. Here, we calibrate bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) as an alternative approach for assessing the nutritional status of vertebrate wildlife in ecological studies. BIS is a portable technology that can estimate body composition from measurements of body impedance and is widely used in humans. BIS is a predictive technique that requires calibration using a reference body composition method. Using sea turtles as model organisms, we propose a calibration protocol using computed tomography (CT) scans, with the prediction equation being: adipose tissue mass (kg)\u00a0=\u00a0body mass\u2009-\u2009(-0.03 [intercept]\u2009-\u00a00.29 * length2/resistance at 50\u2009kHz\u2009+\u00a01.07 * body mass\u2009-\u00a00.11 * time after capture). CT imaging allows for the quantification of body fat. However, processing the images manually is prohibitive due to the extensive time requirement. Using a form of artificial intelligence (AI), we trained a computer model to identify and quantify nonadipose tissue from the CT images, and adipose tissue was determined by the difference in body mass. This process enabled estimating adipose tissue mass from bioelectrical impedance measurements. The predictive performance of the model was built on 2/3 samples and tested against 1/3 samples. Prediction of adipose tissue percentage had greater accuracy when including impedance parameters (mean bias\u00a0=\u00a00.11%-0.61%) as predictor variables, compared with using body mass alone (mean bias\u00a0=\u00a06.35%). Our standardized BIS protocol improves on conventional body composition assessment methods (e.g., BCI) by quantifying adipose tissue mass. The protocol can be applied to other species for the validation of BIS and to provide robust information on the nutritional and health status of wildlife, which, in turn, can be used to inform conservation decisions at the management level.", "To explore the impact of artificial-intelligence perceptual learning when performing the ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic block.\nThis simulation-based randomized study enrolled residents who underwent ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block training at the Department of Anesthesiology of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital between January 2022 and February 2022. Residents were randomly divided into a traditional teaching group and an AI teaching group. All residents attended the same nerve block theory courses, while those in the AI teaching group participated in training course using an AI-assisted nerve identification system based on a convolutional neural network instead of traditional training.\nA total of 40 residents were included. The complication rates of paresthesia during puncture in the first month of clinical sciatic nerve block practice after training were significantly lower in the AI teaching group than in the traditional teaching group [11 (4.12%) vs. 36 (14.06%), P\u2009=\u20090.000093]. The rates of paresthesia/pain during injection were significantly lower in the AI teaching group than in the traditional teaching group [6 (2.25%) vs. 17 (6.64%), P\u2009=\u20090.025]. The Assessment Checklist for Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia (32\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8 vs. 29.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9, P\u2009=\u20090.001) and nerve block self-rating scores (7.53\u2009\u00b1\u20091.62 vs. 6.49\u2009\u00b1\u20091.85, P\u2009<\u20090.001) were significantly higher in the AI teaching group than in the traditional teaching group. There were no significant differences in the remaining indicators.\nThe inclusion of an AI-assisted nerve identification system based on convolutional neural network as part of the training program for ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block via the popliteal approach may reduce the incidence of nerve paresthesia and this might be related to improved perceptual learning.\nCHiCTR2200055115 , registered on 1/ January /2022.", "The advent of whole-slide imaging, faster image data generation, and cheaper forms of data storage have made it easier for pathologists to manipulate digital slide images and interpret more detailed biological processes in conjunction with clinical samples. In parallel, with continuous breakthroughs in object detection, image feature extraction, image classification and image segmentation, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming the most beneficial technology for high-throughput analysis of image data in various biomedical imaging disciplines. Integrating digital images into biological workflows, advanced algorithms, and computer vision techniques expands the biologist's horizons beyond the microscope slide. Here, we introduce recent developments in AI applied to microscopy in hematopathology. We give an overview of its concepts and present its applications in normal or abnormal hematopoietic cells identification. We discuss how AI shows great potential to push the limits of microscopy and enhance the resolution, signal and information content of acquired data. Its shortcomings are discussed, as well as future directions for the field.", "Digital Health Solutions (DHS) approved under the Medical Device Directive (MDD) in the European Union may be used until May 27, 2025. The regulation provides appropriate requirements for the products but lack the evaluation by an external independent organization. For many DHS, the company can make a self-certification that the requirements have been fulfilled. As demonstrated in the evaluation of smartphone-based apps for skin cancer risk assessment such products may expose the public to undue risks. The new Medical Device Regulation provides adequate control of DHS through evaluation of independent organization prior to allowing the product on the market. HTA-evaluators and those who make decisions regarding the use of DHS need to understand the associated risks with the use of products approved according to the MDD and ensure appropriate risk mitigations to ensure that the public is not exposed to undue risk. This perspective aims to inform decisionmakers about the risks associated with the delayed requirement to transition to the new MDR regulation. There is a gap in the current guidance regarding the evolving use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. With the evolving use of DHS, it is important that industry, regulators and HTA evaluators work jointly to establish the safe and effective use of DHS.", "Potential benefits of decision aids and technology, such as artificial intelligence, used at the bedside are many and significant. Like any tools, they must be used appropriately for specific tasks, since even validated decision aids have limited utility when they are misapplied, overly relied upon, or used as a substitute for thinking carefully about clinically and ethically relevant questions. Patients are more than data points in human form, as they come to emergency departments with stories. As technology casts ever-lengthening shadows over patient-clinician interactions, a key question is: How should clinicians cultivate relationships with technology so it functions in solidarity with patients?", "Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria, the current standard-of-care tests that predict risk of kidney function decline in early-stage diabetic kidney disease (DKD), are only modestly useful. We evaluated the decision-making impact of an artificial intelligence-enabled prognostic test, KidneyIntelX, in the management of DKD by primary care physicians (PCPs).\nThis was a prospective web-based survey administered among PCPs in the United States.\nWe used conjoint analysis with multivariable logit models to estimate PCP preferences. The survey included hypothetical patient profiles with 6 attributes: albuminuria, eGFR, age, blood pressure (BP), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and KidneyIntelX result. Each PCP viewed 8 patient profiles randomly selected from 42 unique profiles having 1 level from each attribute. For each patient, PCPs were asked to indicate whether they would prescribe a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, increase angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) dose, and/or refer to a nephrologist.\nA total of 401 PCPs completed the survey (response rate, 8.8%). The relative importance of the top 2 attributes for each decision were HbA1c (52%) and KidneyIntelX result (23%) for prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors, BP (62%) and KidneyIntelX result (13%) for increasing ARB dose, and eGFR (42%) and KidneyIntelX result (27%) for nephrologist referral. A high-risk KidneyIntelX result was associated with significantly higher odds of PCPs prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% CI, 1.29-2.08), increasing ARB dose (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.17-1.89), and referring to a nephrologist (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.99-3.08) compared with no test.\nThe KidneyIntelX test had greater relative importance than albuminuria and eGFR to PCPs in making treatment decisions and was second only to eGFR for nephrologist referrals. Because of its significant impact on decision-making, KidneyIntelX has high clinical utility in DKD management.", "Computed tomography (CT) is important in the diagnosing of lung cancer. The combination of CT features and artificial intelligence algorithm have been used in the diagnosis of various lung diseases. However, limited studies focused on the relationship between the combination of CT features and artificial intelligence algorithm and lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study developed an algorithm for lung cancer CT image segmentation based on an artificial neural network model and investigated the role of a nomogram model based on CT images for predicting lymph node metastasis in lung cancer.\nWiener filtering and fuzzy enhancement were first used to suppress image noise and improve image contrast. Next, texture features and fractal features were extracted. In the third step, the artificial neural network model was trained and tested according to the best parameters of the network.\nThe area under the curve (AUC) of the constructed nomogram model on the training set and the test set were 0.859 (sensitivity, 0.810; specificity, 0.773) and 0.864 (sensitivity, 0.820; specificity, 0.753), respectively. The decision curve indicated that the model had good clinical application value. The lung cancer CT images contained 13 significant regional features of cancer. The best classification function obtained from training and testing data was Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the training stage could reach 98.4%, 100%, and 98.6%, respectively, and the corresponding indexes in the test stage reached 90.9%, 100%, and 95.1%, respectively.\nThe image segmentation algorithm based on the artificial neural network model could extract CT lung cancer lesions efficiently and quasi-determinately, which could be used as an effective tool for radiologists to diagnose lung cancer. The nomogram model based on CT image features and related clinical indicators was an effective method for noninvasive prediction of lymph node metastasis in lung cancer.", "This expert group consensus statement emphasises the need for standardising the definition of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (F-ILDs), with an accurate initial diagnosis being of paramount importance in ensuring appropriate initial management. Equally, case-by-case decisions on monitoring and management are essential, given the varying presentations of F-ILDs and the varying rates of progression. The value of diagnostic tests in risk stratification at presentation and, separately, the importance of a logical monitoring strategy, tailored to manage the risk of progression, are also stressed. The term \"progressive pulmonary fibrosis\" (PPF) exactly describes the entity that clinicians often face in practice. The importance of using antifibrotic therapy early in PPF (once initial management has failed to prevent progression) is increasingly supported by evidence. Artificial intelligence software for high-resolution computed tomography analysis, although an exciting tool for the future, awaits validation. Guidance is provided on pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen and the use of non-invasive ventilation focused specifically on the needs of ILD patients with progressive disease. PPF should be differentiated from acute deterioration due to drug-induced lung toxicity or other forms of acute exacerbations. Referral criteria for a lung transplant are discussed and applied to patient needs in severe diseases where transplantation is not realistic, either due to access limitations or transplantation contraindications. In conclusion, expert group consensus guidance is provided on the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of F-ILDs with specific focus on the recognition of PPF and the management of pulmonary fibrosis progressing despite initial management.", "Learning from a limited number of experiences requires suitable inductive biases. To identify how inductive biases are implemented in and shaped by neural codes, we analyze sample-efficient learning of arbitrary stimulus-response maps from arbitrary neural codes with biologically-plausible readouts. We develop an analytical theory that predicts the generalization error of the readout as a function of the number of observed examples. Our theory illustrates in a mathematically precise way how the structure of population codes shapes inductive bias, and how a match between the code and the task is crucial for sample-efficient learning. It elucidates a bias to explain observed data with simple stimulus-response maps. Using recordings from the mouse primary visual cortex, we demonstrate the existence of an efficiency bias towards low-frequency orientation discrimination tasks for grating stimuli and low spatial frequency reconstruction tasks for natural images. We reproduce the discrimination bias in a simple model of primary visual cortex, and further show how invariances in the code to certain stimulus variations alter learning performance. We extend our methods to time-dependent neural codes and predict the sample efficiency of readouts from recurrent networks. We observe that many different codes can support the same inductive bias. By analyzing recordings from the mouse primary visual cortex, we demonstrate that biological codes have lower total activity than other codes with identical bias. Finally, we discuss implications of our theory in the context of recent developments in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Overall, our study provides a concrete method for elucidating inductive biases of the brain and promotes sample-efficient learning as a general normative coding principle.", "Coeliac disease (CD) is a topic that has gained momentum in recent years due to an increase in the rates of diagnosis and a rise in the number of people following a gluten-free diet (GFD). Previous studies have shown the ability of the media to influence the behavior of the public, particularly in relation to healthcare. The media portrayal of CD, and its significance, has not yet been explored.\nThis study aims to describe and analyze the nature of the media coverage of CD. The implications of the nature of messages should be considered, and any temporal change in content explored.\nA document analysis of local and national UK newspaper articles over three weeks, from May 2nd to May 22nd, 2016, was conducted, ensuring coverage of articles from Coeliac Awareness Week (commencing May 9th). Articles containing instances of CD-related language were collected by Kantar Media\u00a0([London, UK] a media intelligence company) for their client - Coeliac UK\u00a0(Buckinghamshire, UK), and analyzed using a combination of thematic and content analysis techniques. An inductive approach was used to code articles into themes, with frequency data also presented.\nFour hundred eighty-eight articles were included in the analysis, with 233, 117, and 138 articles in weeks one, two, and three, respectively. Six overarching themes were identified: events around Awareness Week and food content noted as gluten-free (GF), as well as raising awareness, encouraging people to seek help, and other health implications and perceptions of CD and the GFD, of which a significant proportion consisted of articles by Coeliac UK. The increasing popularity of the GFD emerged as a theme, encompassing the growth of the GF industry and celebrity endorsements. Notably, positively and negatively framed articles were identified, with most instances of negative articles occurring in week three.\nCoeliac Awareness Week was found to have had an influence on the content of newspaper articles, given the increase in the number of negative articles in week three\u00a0and the significantly higher number of articles in week one. This mixed messaging was considered to negatively impact the potential and current patients with CD, especially in relation to GFD adherence and diagnosis rates.", "An important step towards the development of treatments for cognitive impairment in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases is to identify genetic and environmental modifiers of cognitive function and understand the mechanism by which they exert an effect. In Huntington's disease, the most common autosomal dominant dementia, a small number of studies have identified intellectual enrichment, i.e. a cognitively stimulating lifestyle and genetic polymorphisms as potential modifiers of cognitive function. The aim of our study was to further investigate the relationship and interaction between genetic factors and intellectual enrichment on cognitive function and brain atrophy in Huntington's disease. For this purpose, we analysed data from Track-HD, a multi-centre longitudinal study in Huntington's disease gene carriers and focused on the role of intellectual enrichment (estimated at baseline) and the genes FAN1, MSH3, BDNF, COMT and MAPT in predicting cognitive decline and brain atrophy. We found that carrying the 3a allele in the MSH3 gene had a positive effect on global cognitive function and brain atrophy in multiple cortical regions, such that 3a allele carriers had a slower rate of cognitive decline and atrophy compared with non-carriers, in agreement with its role in somatic instability. No other genetic predictor had a significant effect on cognitive function and the effect of MSH3 was independent of intellectual enrichment. Intellectual enrichment also had a positive effect on cognitive function; participants with higher intellectual enrichment, i.e. those who were better educated, had higher verbal intelligence and performed an occupation that was intellectually engaging, had better cognitive function overall, in agreement with previous studies in Huntington's disease and other dementias. We also found that intellectual enrichment interacted with the BDNF gene, such that the positive effect of intellectual enrichment was greater in Met66 allele carriers than non-carriers. A similar relationship was also identified for changes in whole brain and caudate volume; the positive effect of intellectual enrichment was greater for Met66 allele carriers, rather than for non-carriers. In summary, our study provides additional evidence for the beneficial role of intellectual enrichment and carrying the 3a allele in MSH3 in cognitive function in Huntington's disease and their effect on brain structure.", "Recyclable/reversible adhesives have attracted growing attention for sustainability and intelligence but suffer from low adhesion strength and poor durability in complex conditions. Here, we demonstrate an aromatic siloxane adhesive that exploits stimuli-responsive reversible assembly driven by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, allowing for elimination and activation of interfacial interactions via infiltration-volatilization of ethanol. The robust cohesive energy from water-insensitive siloxane assembly enables durable strong adhesion (3.5 MPa shear strength on glasses) on diverse surfaces. Long-term adhesion performances are realized in underwater, salt, and acid/alkali solutions (pH 1-14) and at low/high temperatures (-10-90\u00b0C). With reversible assembly/disassembly, the adhesive is closed-loop recycled (~100%) and reused over 100 times without adhesion loss. Furthermore, the adhesive has unique combinations of high transparency (~98% in the visible light region of 400-800 nm) and flame retardancy. The experiments and theoretical calculations reveal the corresponding mechanism at the molecular level. This \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking-driven siloxane assembly strategy opens up an avenue for high-performance adhesives with circular life and multifunctional integration.", "Artificial Intelligence is a tool poised to transform healthcare, with use in diagnostics and therapeutics. The widespread use of digital pathology has been due to the advent of whole slide imaging. Cheaper storage for digital images, along with unprecedented progress in artificial intelligence, have paved the synergy of these two fields. This has pushed the limits of traditional diagnosis using light microscopy, from a more subjective to a more objective method of looking at cases, incorporating grading too. The grading of histopathological images of urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder is important with direct implications for surgical management and prognosis. In this study, the aim is to classify urothelial carcinoma into low and high grade based on the WHO 2016 classification. The hematoxylin and eosin-stained transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) samples of both low and high grade non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma were digitally scanned. Patches were extracted from these whole slide images to feed into a deep learning (Convolution Neural Network: CNN) model. Patches were segregated if they had tumor tissue and only included for model training if a threshold of 90% of tumor tissue per patch was seen. Various parameters of the deep learning model, known as hyperparameters, were optimized to get the best accuracy for grading or classification into low- and high-grade urothelial carcinoma. The model was robust with an overall accuracy of 90% after hyperparameter tuning. Visualization in the form of a class activation map using Grad-CAM was done. This indicates that such a model can be used as a companion diagnostic tool for grading of urothelial carcinoma. The probable causes of this accuracy are summarized along with the limitations of this study and future work possible.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as machine learning and natural language processing, have the potential to provide new insights into complex health data. Although powerful, these algorithms rarely move from experimental studies to direct clinical care implementation.\nWe aimed to describe the key components for successful development and integration of two AI technology-based research pipelines for clinical practice.\nWe summarized the approach, results, and key learnings from the implementation of the following two systems implemented at a large, tertiary care children's hospital: (1) epilepsy surgical candidate identification (or epilepsy ID) in an ambulatory neurology clinic; and (2) an automated clinical trial eligibility screener (ACTES) for the real-time identification of patients for research studies in a pediatric emergency department.\nThe epilepsy ID system performed as well as board-certified neurologists in identifying surgical candidates (with a sensitivity of 71% and positive predictive value of 77%). The ACTES system decreased coordinator screening time by 12.9%. The success of each project was largely dependent upon the collaboration between machine learning experts, research and operational information technology professionals, longitudinal support from clinical providers, and institutional leadership.\nThese projects showcase novel interactions between machine learning recommendations and providers during clinical care. Our deployment provides seamless, real-time integration of AI technology to provide decision support and improve patient care.", "Despite the knowledge that mutation, multiplication, and anomalous function of \u03b1-synuclein cause progressive transformation of \u03b1-synuclein monomers into toxic amyloid fibrils in neurodegenerative diseases, the understanding of canonical signaling, interaction network molecules, biological functions, and role of \u03b1-synuclein remains ambiguous. The evolution of artificial intelligence and Bioinformatics tools have enabled us to analyze a vast pool of data to draw meaningful conclusions about the events occurring in complex biological systems. We have taken the advantage of such a Bioinformatics tool, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) to decipher the signaling pathways, interactome, biological functions, and role of \u03b1-synuclein. IPA of the \u03b1-synuclein NCBI gene dataset revealed neuroinflammation, Huntington's disease, TREM1, phagosome maturation, and sirtuin signaling as the key canonical signaling pathways. IPA further revealed Parkinson's disease (PD), sumoylation, and SNARE signaling pathways specific to the toxicity of \u03b1-synuclein. A frequency distribution analysis of \u03b1-synuclein-associated genes from the NCBI dataset that appeared in the predicted canonical pathways revealed that NFKB1 was the most populated gene across the predicted pathways followed by FOS, PRKCD, TNF, GSK3B, CDC42, IL6, MTOR, PLCB1, and IL1B. Overlapping of the predicted top-five canonical signaling pathways and the \u03b1-synuclein NCBI gene dataset divulged that neuroinflammation signaling was the most overlapped pathway, while NFKB1, TNF, and CASP1 were the most shared molecules among the pathways. The major diseases associated with \u03b1-synuclein were predicted to be neurological diseases, organismal injury and abnormalities, skeletal and muscular disorders, psychological disorders, and hereditary disorders. The molecule activity predictor (MAP) analysis of the principal interaction network of \u03b1-synuclein gene SNCA revealed that SNCA directly interacts with APP, CLU, and NEDD4, whereas it indirectly communicates with CALCA and SOD1. Besides, IPA also predicted amyloid plaque forming APP, cytokines/inflammatory mediators IL1B, TNF, MIF, PTGS2, TP53, and CCL2, and kinases of MAPK family Mek, ERK, and P38 MAPK as the top upstream regulators of \u03b1-synuclein signaling cascades. Taken together, the first IPA analysis of \u03b1-synuclein predicted PD as the key toxicity pathway, neurodegeneration as the major pathological outcome, and inflammatory mediators as the critical interacting partners of \u03b1-synuclein.", "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is essential for enabling clinical users to get informed decision support from AI and comply with evidence-based medical practice. Applying XAI in clinical settings requires proper evaluation criteria to ensure the explanation technique is both technically sound and clinically useful, but specific support is lacking to achieve this goal. To bridge the research gap, we propose the Clinical XAI Guidelines that consist of five criteria a clinical XAI needs to be optimized for. The guidelines recommend choosing an explanation form based on Guideline 1 (G1) Understandability and G2 Clinical relevance. For the chosen explanation form, its specific XAI technique should be optimized for G3 Truthfulness, G4 Informative plausibility, and G5 Computational efficiency. Following the guidelines, we conducted a systematic evaluation on a novel problem of multi-modal medical image explanation with two clinical tasks, and proposed new evaluation metrics accordingly. Sixteen commonly-used heatmap XAI techniques were evaluated and found to be insufficient for clinical use due to their failure in G3 and G4. Our evaluation demonstrated the use of Clinical XAI Guidelines to support the design and evaluation of clinically viable XAI.", "The development of increasingly more complex computer and electromotor technologies enables the increasing use and expansion of robot-assisted systems in trauma surgery rehabilitation; however, the currently available devices are rarely comprehensively applied but are often used within pilot projects and studies. Different technological approaches, such as exoskeletal systems, functional electrical stimulation, soft robotics, neurorobotics and brain-machine interfaces are used and combined to read and process the communication between, e.g., residual musculature or brain waves, to transfer them to the executing device and to enable the desired execution.Currently, the greatest amount of evidence exists for the use of exoskeletal systems with different modes of action in the context of gait and stance rehabilitation in paraplegic patients; however, their use also plays a role in the rehabilitation of fractures close to the hip joint and endoprosthetic care. So-called single joint systems are also being tested in the rehabilitation of functionally impaired extremities, e.g., after knee prosthesis implantation. At this point, however, the current data situation is still too limited to be able to make a\u00a0clear statement about the use of these technologies in the trauma surgery \"core business\" of rehabilitation after fractures and other joint injuries.For rehabilitation after limb amputation, in addition to the further development of myoelectric prostheses, the current development of \"sentient\" prostheses is of great interest.

Big Data and artificial intelligence can be used to analyze previous disasters, examine lessons learned, and evaluate other data resources, such as remote sensors, to provide a foundation for predicting future events, resulting in more effective planning and cost-effective disaster response. This article examines the role of Big Data and artificial intelligence in building community resilience, so communities have the ability/capacity to adapt and recover effectively from disasters.", "In this article, we argue that the government's post 9-11 torture program was a big lie, in that the designers, executors and enablers knew all along that torture does not elicit reliable information. We review the government's own research on the matter, and we discuss the ways in which methods known to be unreliable were implemented, most saliently at the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. We review the secrecy and propaganda surrounding the scope and horror of the torture program at Guant\u00e1namo and black sites around the world, and the painful truth of how the government knowingly adopted the terror policies of the torture program, against their own knowledge, against international human rights, and against the law. On January 20, 2021, Joseph R. Biden, Jr. became the 46th President of the United States, following what might very well have been the most chaotic election in the recent history of the United States. The turmoil reached a peak on Jan 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington, DC. At the center of this extended and ongoing political upheaval is what has been labeled \"The Big Lie\" - the completely disproven notion that Biden's win was based on fraudulent grounds, and that the election was stolen from Trump because of a corrupted voting process. President Biden has consistently rejected reality warping and presents himself on the national stage as a man of reason, and a strong supporter of science. He has proclaimed \"Science is discovery. It's not fiction\", as he announced that his team of scientific advisors would summon \"science and truth\" to combat climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges facing his new administration, adding \"The same laws apply, the same evidence holds true regardless of whether you accept them.\" President Biden can show his self-proclaimed commitment to truth by following through on his words with action. In particular, he can fulfil the task which his two predecessors, Trump and Obama, both failed to do: Closing the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The same United States law and international law apply; the same evidence, or lack thereof holds true for those remaining 38 prisoners being held within the confines of a US-run concentration camp in the Caribbean. The laws of science apply, the rules of evidence apply, and the rule of law applies. Science and truth cannot be situationally applied to suit political agendas, especially not within the confines of a facility once called a \"Battle Lab\" (Leopold, 2015), where the military touts phrases like \"honor bound\" and \"defend freedom\" at the entrance, yet the truths of what goes on inside are withheld from the public record, via the government's complex layers of secrecy, including classification, redactions, and obfuscations. There can be no justice without truth. The system has derailed every effort to bring the suspected 9/11 terrorists to justice before tribunals that have failed and have been derailed by torture. While President Biden can't remove the stain of the national torture policies, he can show that the Constitution endures; that the rule of law prevails, by illuminating the shadowland of the torture regime. Joe Biden needs to demonstrate that truth matters - even painful truths. In this article, we will describe that through a painstaking and laborious process of discovery, we now know that behind the gates of Guant\u00e1namo Bay and its related archipelago of black sites there were prisoners, often held on dubious grounds or no reasonable grounds at all. We know that these prisoners were submitted to treatments aimed squarely at generating complete psychological disintegration. As we will lay out in the article, prisoners captured during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom were subjected to physical violence, sexual violence, and an astonishing array of psychologically abusive tactics under the misnomer 'interrogation'. We also know that the torture program metastasized into a monster, as if lifted from the pages of the most absurd of postmodern fictions, and that the United States has never held anyone accountable, nor faced any reckoning for this disaster of human rights (Senate Select Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency Detention and Interrogation Program, 2014). And we know that the disaster that was the torture program was all based on lies, one big lie in particular - that torture worked to break through to truth. The chief argument, which we will defend below, is that the schemers behind the system of torture knew all along that this was bogus; that torture does nothing to produce truth, that what it breaks is a person's autonomy and very selfhood, rendering them compliant in the extreme. Indeed, the CIA and United States military, who both committed war crimes, knew all along that they propagated falsehoods - our main argument is that the historical record shows that the CIA itself has a long history of studying precisely the effect of techniques like those employed post 9/11. As we shall see, the so called architects had no interrogation experience, but were well-versed in communist-based methodologies known to produce false information.", "As the worldwide spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues for a long time, early prediction of the maximum severity is required for effective treatment of each patient.\nThis study aimed to develop predictive models for the maximum severity of hospitalized COVID-19 patients using artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) algorithms.\nThe medical records of 2,263 COVID-19 patients admitted to 10 hospitals in Daegu, Korea, from February 18, 2020, to May 19, 2020, were comprehensively reviewed. The maximum severity during hospitalization was divided into four groups according to the severity level: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. The patient's initial hospitalization records were used as predictors. The total dataset was randomly split into a training set and a testing set in a 2:1 ratio, taking into account the four maximum severity groups. Predictive models were developed using the training set and were evaluated using the testing set. Two approaches were performed: using four groups based on original severity levels groups (i.e., 4-group classification) and using two groups after regrouping the four severity level into two (i.e., binary classification). Three variable selection methods including randomForestSRC were performed. As AI/ML algorithms for 4-group classification, GUIDE and proportional odds model were used. For binary classification, we used five AI/ML algorithms, including deep neural network and GUIDE.\nOf the four maximum severity groups, the moderate group had the highest percentage (1,115 patients; 49.5%). As factors contributing to exacerbation of maximum severity, there were 25 statistically significant predictors through simple analysis of linear trends. As a result of model development, the following three models based on binary classification showed high predictive performance: (1) Mild vs. Above Moderate, (2) Below Moderate vs. Above Severe, and (3) Below Severe vs. Critical. The performance of these three binary models was evaluated using AUC values 0.883, 0.879, and, 0.887, respectively. Based on results for each of the three predictive models, we developed web-based nomograms for clinical use (http://statgen.snu.ac.kr/software/nomogramDaeguCovid/).\nWe successfully developed web-based nomograms predicting the maximum severity. These nomograms are expected to help plan an effective treatment for each patient in the clinical field.", "Ni-rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high-energy Li-ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in situ co-precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super-dispersed Nb-doped Ni-rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super-dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C with much better retention at 55 \u00b0C and 5 C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb-doped Ni-rich cathodes. In a pouch-type full cell, it exhibits exceptionally long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1 C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5 C after 2000 cycles within 3.0-4.2\u00a0V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater to the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.", "The last two years have taught us that we need to change the way we practice medicine. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, obstetrics and gynecology setting has changed enormously. Monitoring pregnant women prevents deaths and complications. Doctors and computer data scientists must learn to communicate and work together to improve patients' health. In this paper we present a good practice example of a competitive/collaborative communication model for doctors, computer scientists and artificial intelligence systems, for signaling fetal congenital anomalies in the second trimester morphology scan.", "Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is essential for diagnostic workup of patients with neurological diseases and includes differential cell typing. The current gold standard is based on microscopic examination by specialised technicians and neuropathologists, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive and subjective.\nWe, therefore, developed an image analysis approach based on expert annotations of 123,181 digitised CSF objects from 78 patients corresponding to 15 clinically relevant categories and trained a multiclass convolutional neural network (CNN).\nThe CNN classified the 15 categories with high accuracy (mean AUC 97.3%). By using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), we demonstrate that the CNN identified meaningful cellular substructures in CSF cells recapitulating human pattern recognition. Based on the evaluation of 511 cells selected from 12 different CSF samples, we validated the CNN by comparing it with seven board-certified neuropathologists blinded for clinical information. Inter-rater agreement between the CNN and the ground truth was non-inferior (Krippendorff's alpha 0.79) compared with the agreement of seven human raters and the ground truth (mean Krippendorff's alpha 0.72, range 0.56-0.81). The CNN assigned the correct diagnostic label (inflammatory, haemorrhagic or neoplastic) in 10 out of 11 clinical samples, compared with 7-11 out of 11 by human raters.\nOur approach provides the basis to overcome current limitations in automated cell classification for routine diagnostics and demonstrates how a visual explanation framework can connect machine decision-making with cell properties and thus provide a novel versatile and quantitative method for investigating CSF manifestations of various neurological diseases.", "Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used for applications in veterinary radiology, including detection of abnormalities and automated measurements. Unlike human radiology, there is no formal regulation or validation of AI algorithms for veterinary medicine and both general practitioner and specialist veterinarians must rely on their own judgment when deciding whether or not to incorporate AI algorithms to aid their clinical decision-making. The benefits and challenges to developing clinically useful and diagnostically accurate AI algorithms are discussed. Considerations for the development of AI research projects are also addressed. A framework is suggested to help veterinarians, in both research and clinical practice contexts, assess AI algorithms for veterinary radiology.", "Over the past 4 decades our ability to maintain a viable human embryo in\u00a0vitro has improved dramatically, leading to higher implantation rates. This has led to a notable shift to single blastocyst transfer and the ensuing elimination of high order multiple gestations. Future improvements to embryo culture systems will not only come from new improved innovative media formulations (such as the inclusion of antioxidants), but plausibly by moving away from static culture to more dynamic perfusion-based systems now made a reality owing to the breakthroughs in three-dimensional printing technology and micro fabrication. Such an approach has already made it feasible to create high resolution devices for intracytoplasmic sperm injection, culture, and cryopreservation, paving the way not only for improvements in outcomes but also automation of assisted reproductive technology. Although improvements in culture systems can lead to further increases in pregnancy outcomes, the ability to quantitate biomarkers of embryo health and viability will reduce time to pregnancy and decrease pregnancy loss. Currently artificial intelligence is being used to assess embryo development through image analysis, but we predict its power will be realized through the creation of selection algorithms based on the integration of information related to metabolic functions, cell-free DNA, and morphokinetics, thereby using vast amounts of different data types obtained for each embryo to predict outcomes. All of this will not only make assisted reproductive technology more effective, but it will also make it more cost effective, thereby increasing patient access to infertility treatment worldwide.", "Despite broad interest of the Syrian refugee plight in the academic and media circles, there are still limited studies analyzing the lived experiences of torture survivors under the Syrian regime. This qualitative study interviewed torture survivors to examine the form and function of the Syrian regime's security apparatus, and the personal aftermath of survivors.\nThirteen in-depth interviews were conducted in Arabic with Syrian refugees who endured torture. Study participants were at least 19\u00a0years of age, resided as refugees in Jordan, and voluntarily agreed to participate in the study. Participation was anonymous and no incentives were provided. Only oral consent was required. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and translated to English, and then analyzed for repetitive themes utilizing the narrative approach.\nMajor themes were observed across three experience-phases: pre-captivity, during captivity, and post-captivity. The pre-captivity phase included two sub-themes: the Syrian regime's initial detection and arrest system, and the intelligence system. The captivity phase was also divided into two sub-themes: environmental conditions in detention facilities, and torture methods including physical and psychological torture. Some of the environmental conditions in detention facilities included lack of sanitation, crowding, starvation, and withholding of medical care. Torture methods encompassed beatings, electric shocks, nail-pulling, hanging, drowning, suffocation, rape, and the witnessing of killing, sexual assault, or torture of others. The post-captivity phase included their release from captivity, escaping Syria, and post-displacement conditions and activism.\nThe Syrian regime employs a vast security apparatus to track, detain, interrogate, torture, and subjugate its civilian population. A systematic mechanism commences even before captivity and continues for years after release, with negative implications on the well-being of survivors, their families, and the Syrian people as a collective community. The Syrian war saw a shift toward mass detention, torture as a form of social punishment, subjugation, and indeterminate imprisonment. Intervention agencies, host countries, and policymakers must be informed of survivors' experiences to better address their needs. Moreover, the international community must advocate for a firm stance against torture, demand justice, and prosecute all parties engaged in perpetuating such extreme forms of suffering and trauma.", "The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the diagnostic performance, in independent test cohorts, of artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms aimed at characterizing/detecting prostate cancer on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nMedline, Embase and Web of Science were searched for studies published between January 2018 and September 2022, using a histological reference standard, and assessing prostate cancer characterization/detection by AI-based MRI algorithms in test cohorts composed of more than 40 patients and with at least one of the following independency criteria as compared to the training cohort: different institution, different population type, different MRI vendor, different magnetic field strength or strict temporal splitting.\nThirty-five studies were selected. The overall risk of bias was low. However, 23 studies did not use predefined diagnostic thresholds, which may have optimistically biased the results. Test cohorts fulfilled one to three of the five independency criteria. The diagnostic performance of the algorithms used as standalones was good, challenging that of human reading. In the 12 studies with predefined diagnostic thresholds, radiomics-based computer-aided diagnosis systems (assessing regions-of-interest drawn by the radiologist) tended to provide more robust results than deep learning-based computer-aided detection systems (providing probability maps). Two of the six studies comparing unassisted and assisted reading showed significant improvement due to the algorithm, mostly by reducing false positive findings.\nProstate MRI AI-based algorithms showed promising results, especially for the relatively simple task of characterizing predefined lesions. The best management of discrepancies between human reading and algorithm findings still needs to be defined.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad concept that usually refers to computer programs that can learn from data and perform certain specific tasks. In the recent years, the growth of deep learning, a successful technique for computer vision tasks that does not require explicit programming, coupled with the availability of large imaging databases fostered the development of multiple applications in the medical imaging field, especially for lung nodules and lung cancer, mostly through convolutional neural networks (CNN). Some of the first applications of AI is this field were dedicated to automated detection of lung nodules on X-ray and computed tomography (CT) examinations, with performances now reaching or exceeding those of radiologists. For lung nodule segmentation, CNN-based algorithms applied to CT images show excellent spatial overlap index with manual segmentation, even for irregular and ground glass nodules. A third application of AI is the classification of lung nodules between malignant and benign, which could limit the number of follow-up CT examinations for less suspicious lesions. Several algorithms have demonstrated excellent capabilities for the prediction of the malignancy risk when a nodule is discovered. These different applications of AI for lung nodules are particularly appealing in the context of lung cancer screening. In the field of lung cancer, AI tools applied to lung imaging have been investigated for distinct aims. First, they could play a role for the non-invasive characterization of tumors, especially for histological subtype and somatic mutation predictions, with a potential therapeutic impact. Additionally, they could help predict the patient prognosis, in combination to clinical data. Despite these encouraging perspectives, clinical implementation of AI tools is only beginning because of the lack of generalizability of published studies, of an inner obscure working and because of limited data about the impact of such tools on the radiologists' decision and on the patient outcome. Radiologists must be active participants in the process of evaluating AI tools, as such tools could support their daily work and offer them more time for high added value tasks.", "Wildlife and wildlife interfaces with people and livestock are essential surveillance targets to monitor emergent or endemic pathogens or new threats affecting wildlife, livestock, and human health. However, limitations of previous investments in scope and duration have resulted in a neglect of wildlife health surveillance (WHS) systems at national and global scales, particularly in lower and middle income countries (LMICs). Building on decades of wildlife health activities in LMICs, we demonstrate the implementation of a locally-driven multi-pronged One Health approach to establishing WHS in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam under the WildHealthNet initiative. WildHealthNet utilizes existing local capacity in the animal, public health, and environmental sectors for event based or targeted surveillance and disease detection. To scale up surveillance systems to the national level, WildHealthNet relies on iterative field implementation and policy development, capacity bridging, improving data collection and management systems, and implementing context specific responses to wildlife health intelligence. National WHS systems piloted in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam engaged protected area rangers, wildlife rescue centers, community members, and livestock and human health sector staff and laboratories. Surveillance activities detected outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds, African swine fever in wild boar (Sus scrofa), Lumpy skin disease in banteng (Bos javanicus), and other endemic zoonotic pathogens identified as surveillance priorities by local stakeholders. In Cambodia and Lao PDR, national plans for wildlife disease surveillance are being signed into legislation. Cross-sectoral and trans-disciplinary approaches are needed to implement effective WHS systems. Long-term commitment, and paralleled implementation and policy development are key to sustainable WHS networks. WildHealthNet offers a roadmap to aid in the development of locally-relevant and locally-led WHS systems that support the global objectives of the World Organization for Animal Health's Wildlife Health Framework and other international agendas.", "Anorectal manometry (ARM) is the gold standard for the evaluation of anorectal functional disorders, prevalent in the population. Nevertheless, the accessibility to this examination is limited, and the complexity of data analysis and report is a significant drawback. This pilot study aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence model to automatically differentiate motility patterns of fecal incontinence (FI) from obstructed defecation (OD) using ARM data.\nWe developed and tested multiple machine learning algorithms for the automatic interpretation of ARM data. Four models were tested: k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosting (xGB). These models were trained using a stratified 5-fold strategy. Their performance was assessed after fine-tuning of each model's hyperparameters, using 90% of data for training and 10% of data for testing.\nA total of 827 ARM examinations were used in this study. After fine-tuning, the xGB model presented an overall accuracy (84.6% \u00b1 2.9%), similar to that of random forests (82.7% \u00b1 4.8%) and support vector machines (81.0% \u00b1 8.0%) and higher that of k-nearest neighbors (74.4% \u00b1 3.8%). The xGB models showed the highest discriminating performance between OD and FI, with an area under the curve of 0.939.\nThe tested machine learning algorithms, particularly the xGB model, accurately differentiated between FI and OD manometric patterns. Subsequent development of these tools may optimize the access to ARM studies, which may have a significant impact on the management of patients with anorectal functional diseases.", "The consolidation of Telepharmacy during the COVID-19\u00a0pandemic\u00a0 has raised the need for managing large volumes of real-time\u00a0activity data\u00a0 through data analysis.

Functional neuroimaging may enable direct and accurate measurement of cognitive reserve which could have considerable clinical potential. The present study aimed to develop and validate a measure of cognitive reserve using task-based fMRI data that could then be applied to independent resting-state data. Connectome-based predictive modelling with leave-one-out cross-validation was applied to predict a residual measure of cognitive reserve using task-based functional connectivity from the Cognitive Reserve/Reference Ability Neural Network studies (n\u2009=\u2009220, mean age\u2009=\u200951.91\u2009years, SD\u2009=\u200917.04\u2009years). This model generated summary measures of connectivity strength that accurately predicted a residual measure of cognitive reserve in unseen participants. The theoretical validity of these measures was established via a positive correlation with a socio-behavioural proxy of cognitive reserve (verbal intelligence) and a positive correlation with global cognition, independent of brain structure. This fitted model was then applied to external test data: resting-state functional connectivity data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA, n\u2009=\u2009294, mean age\u2009=\u200968.3\u2009years, SD\u2009=\u20097.18\u2009years). The network-strength predicted measures were not positively associated with a residual measure of cognitive reserve nor with measures of verbal intelligence and global cognition. The present study demonstrated that task-based functional connectivity data can be used to generate theoretically valid measures of cognitive reserve. Further work is needed to establish if, and how, measures of cognitive reserve derived from task-based functional connectivity can be applied to independent resting-state data.", "Early detection of pneumothorax, most often via chest radiography, can help determine need for emergent clinical intervention. The ability to accurately detect and rapidly triage pneumothorax with an artificial intelligence (AI) model could assist with earlier identification and improve care.\nTo compare the accuracy of an AI model vs consensus thoracic radiologist interpretations in detecting any pneumothorax (incorporating both nontension and tension pneumothorax) and tension pneumothorax.\nThis diagnostic study was a retrospective standalone performance assessment using a data set of 1000 chest radiographs captured between June 1, 2015, and May 31, 2021. The radiographs were obtained from patients aged at least 18 years at 4 hospitals in the Mass General Brigham hospital network in the United States. Included radiographs were selected using 2 strategies from all chest radiography performed at the hospitals, including inpatient and outpatient. The first strategy identified consecutive radiographs with pneumothorax through a manual review of radiology reports, and the second strategy identified consecutive radiographs with tension pneumothorax using natural language processing. For both strategies, negative radiographs were selected by taking the next negative radiograph acquired from the same radiography machine as each positive radiograph. The final data set was an amalgamation of these processes. Each radiograph was interpreted independently by up to 3 radiologists to establish consensus ground-truth interpretations. Each radiograph was then interpreted by the AI model for the presence of pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax. This study was conducted between July and October 2021, with the primary analysis performed between October and November 2021.\nThe primary end points were the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for the detection of pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax. The secondary end points were the sensitivities and specificities for the detection of pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax.\nThe final analysis included radiographs from 985 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.8 [19.0] years; 436 [44.3%] female patients), including 307 patients with nontension pneumothorax, 128 patients with tension pneumothorax, and 550 patients without pneumothorax. The AI model detected any pneumothorax with an AUC of 0.979 (95% CI, 0.970-0.987), sensitivity of 94.3% (95% CI, 92.0%-96.3%), and specificity of 92.0% (95% CI, 89.6%-94.2%) and tension pneumothorax with an AUC of 0.987 (95% CI, 0.980-0.992), sensitivity of 94.5% (95% CI, 90.6%-97.7%), and specificity of 95.3% (95% CI, 93.9%-96.6%).\nThese findings suggest that the assessed AI model accurately detected pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax in this chest radiograph data set. The model's use in the clinical workflow could lead to earlier identification and improved care for patients with pneumothorax.", "Aim: To explore the ability of You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) to detect and classify breast lesions on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Methods: Four YOLOv5 submodels were examined. A total of 2124 and 2226 images of benign and malignant lesions were obtained, respectively. Precision, recall rate and mean average precision were used to evaluate model performance. Results: The precision (0.916) and mean average precision _0.5 (0.894) of YOLOv5s were higher than those of YOLOv5m (0.832, 0.794), YOLOv5l (0.843, 0.803) and YOLOv5x (0.854, 0.821). In the validation set, YOLOv5s required 1.1\u00a0ms to detect lesions per image. Conclusion: YOLOv5s was the fastest and had the highest precision among the four YOLOv5 submodels for the detection and classification of breast lesions on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. It has a greater clinical application value.\nYou Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) is the latest YOLO series, which may be a useful tool for detecting and classifying breast lesions on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and help clinicians make a rapid, accurate diagnosis and provide treatment. Data were retrospectively collected from a single-center study. The performances of the four submodels (YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l and YOLOv5x) were compared. The diagnostic performances of YOLOv5s were comparable with some convolutional neural network models for breast lesion identification in breast ultrasonography and mammography. This study may provide novel insights into the detection and classification of breast lesions on DCE-MRI. Thus, a sufficiently large series of data and high-quality DCE-MRIs are warranted. Owing to its applications in artificial intelligence-assisted imaging diagnosis, this method has promising prospects.", "The present study referred to the technology-based learning model to conduct a systematic review of the dimensions of nursing activities, research samples, research methods, roles of artificial intelligence, applied artificial intelligence algorithms, evaluation measure of algorithms, and research foci. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedure, this study obtained and analyzed a total of 102 high-quality artificial intelligence-associated nursing activities studies published from 2001 to 2020 in the Web of Science database. The results showed: (1) In terms of nursing activities, nursing management was explored the most, followed by nursing assessment; (2) quantitative methods were most frequently adopted in artificial intelligence-associated nursing activities studies to investigate issues related to patients, followed by nursing staff; (3) the most adopted roles of artificial intelligence in artificial intelligence-associated nursing activities studies were profiling and prediction, followed by assessment and evaluation; (4) artificial intelligence-associated nursing activities studies frequently mixed applied artificial intelligence algorithms and evaluation measure of algorithms; (5) in the dimension of research foci, most studies mainly paid attention to the design or evaluation of the artificial intelligence systems/instruments, followed by investigating the correlation and affect issues. Based on the findings, several recommendations are raised as a reference for future researchers, educators, and policy makers.", "Riboflavin is an essential water-soluble vitamin that needs to be provided through the diet because of the conversion into flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), important cofactors in hundreds of flavoenzymes. The adsorption and distribution of riboflavin is mediated by transmembrane transporters of the SLC52 family, namely RFVT1-3, whose mutations are mainly associated with two diseases, MADD and the Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome. Interest in RFVTs as pharmacological targets has increased in the last few years due to their overexpression in several cancer cells, which can be exploited both by blocking the uptake of riboflavin into the cancerous cells, and by performing cancer targeted delivery of drugs with a high affinity for RFVTs. In this work, we propose three-dimensional structural models for all three human riboflavin transporters obtained by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-based methods, which were then further refined with molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, two of the most notable mutations concerning RFVT2 and RFVT3 (W31S and N21S, respectively) were investigated studying the interactions between the wild-type and mutated transporters with riboflavin.", "Chemical synthesis always plays an irreplaceable role in chemical, materials, and pharmacological fields. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) is causing a rapid technological revolution in many fields by replacing manual chemical synthesis and has exhibited a much more economical and time-efficient manner. However, the rate-determining step of AI-controlled synthesis systems is rarely mentioned, which makes it difficult to apply them in general laboratories. Here, the history of developing AI-aided synthesis has been overviewed and summarized. We propose that the hardware of AI-controlled synthesis systems should be more adaptive to execute reactions with different phase reagents and under different reaction conditions, and the software of AI-controlled synthesis systems should have richer kinds of reaction prediction modules. An updated system will better address more different kinds of syntheses. Our viewpoint could help scientists advance the revolution that combines AI and synthesis to achieve more progress in complicated systems.", "The expeditious transmission of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a strain of COVID-19, crumbled the global economic strength and caused a veritable collapse in health infrastructure. The molecular modeling of the novel coronavirus research sounds promising and equips more evidence about the pragmatic therapeutic options. This article proposes a machine-learning framework for identifying potential COVID-19 transcriptomic signatures. The transcriptomics data contains immune-related genes collected from multiple tissues (blood, nasal, and buccal) with accession number: GSE183071. Extensive bioinformatics work was carried out to identify the potential candidate markers, including differential expression analysis, protein interactions, gene ontology, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)\u00a0pathway enrichment studies. The overlapping investigation found SERPING1, the gene that encodes a glycosylated plasma protein C1-INH, in all three datasets. Furthermore, the immuno-informatics study was conducted on the C1-INH protein. 5DU3, the protein identifier of C1-INH, was fetched to identify the antigenicity, major histocompatibility\u00a0(MHC) Class I and II binding epitopes, allergenicity, toxicity, and immunogenicity. The screening of peptides satisfying the vaccine-design criteria based on the metrics mentioned above is performed. The drug-gene interaction study reported that Rhucin is strongly associated with SERPING1. HSIC-Lasso (Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion-least absolute\u00a0shrinkage and selection operator), a model-free biomarker selection technique, was employed to identify the genes having a nonlinear relationship with the target class. The gene subset is trained with supervised machine learning models by a leave-one-out cross-validation method. Explainable artificial intelligence\u00a0techniques perform the model interpretation analysis.", "In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has created a new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunity for colorectal cancer (CRC). Numerous academic and clinical studies have demonstrated that high-level auxiliary diagnosis and treatment systems based on AI technology can significantly improve the readability of medical data, objectively provide a reliable and comprehensive reference for physicians, reduce the experience gap between physicians, and aid physicians in making more accurate diagnosis decisions. In this study, we used bibliometric techniques to visually analyze the literature about AI in the CRC field and summarize the current situation and research hotspots in this field.\nThe relevant literature on AI in the field of CRC research was obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The software CiteSpace was utilized to analyze the number of papers, countries, institutions, authors, journals, cited literature, and keywords of the included literature and generate a visual knowledge map. The present study aims to evaluate the origin, current hotspots, and research trends of AI in CRC using bibliometric analysis.\nAs of March 2022, 64 nations/regions, 230 institutions, 245 journals, and 300 authors had published 562 AI-related articles in the field of CRC. Since 2016, each year has seen an exponential increase. China and the United States were the largest contributors, with the largest number of beneficial research institutions and the closest collaboration relationship. The World Journal of Gastroenterology is this field's most widely published journal. Diagnosis and treatment research, gene and immunology research, intestinal polyp research, tumor grading research, gastrointestinal endoscopy research, and prognosis research comprised the six topics derived from high-frequency keyword cluster analysis.\nIn recent years, field research has been a popular topic of discussion. The results of our bibliometric analysis allow us to comprehend better the current situation and trend of this research field, and the quantitative data indicators can serve as a guide for the research and application of global scholars.", "Bacterial-infected wounds are a serious threat to public health. Bacterial invasion can easily delay the wound healing process and even cause more serious damage. Therefore, effective new methods or drugs are needed to treat wounds. Nanozyme is an artificial enzyme that mimics the activity of a natural enzyme, and a substitute for natural enzymes by mimicking the coordination environment of the catalytic site. Due to the numerous excellent properties of nanozymes, the generation of drug-resistant bacteria can be avoided while treating bacterial infection wounds by catalyzing the sterilization mechanism of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Notably, there are still some defects in the nanozyme antibacterial agents, and the design direction is to realize the multifunctionalization and intelligence of a single system. In this review, we first discuss the pathophysiology of bacteria infected wound healing, the formation of bacterial infection wounds, and the strategies for treating bacterially infected wounds. In addition, the antibacterial advantages and mechanism of nanozymes for bacteria-infected wounds are also described. Importantly, a series of nanomaterials based on nanozyme synthesis for the treatment of infected wounds are emphasized. Finally, the challenges and prospects of nanozymes for treating bacterial infection wounds are proposed for future research in this field.", "The use of abbreviations in patient records in Danish hospitals is extensive. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of abbreviations, how they affect the comprehension, and how much time was saved writing abbreviations.\nThe study consisted of four sub-studies. First, a prospective collection of abbreviations from patient records. From these, three sentences were constructed and used in the other three sub-studies: a questionnaire for doctors concerning the use of abbreviations, an evaluation of time used to understand abbreviated versus non-abbreviated sentences, and a theoretical analysis of time saved by reducing the number of written characters.\nWe found several abbreviations with multiple meanings. Writing a sentence with abbreviations saved 20 seconds. Comprehension of an abbreviated sentence took an extra 12-85 seconds. There was no difference in comprehension of abbreviations based on medical experience. Finally, data showed that neurologists' self-rated comprehension of complicated abbreviated sentences was very good.\nNumerous abbreviations were used in Danish patient records, many which could not be looked up. The use of abbreviations in patient records might not live up to the Danish record-keeping order, and we proposed four solutions to overcome the problem: more bureaucracy and administration; embrace and expand use of abbreviations; introduction of artificial intelligence to interpret abbreviations; or usage of speech recognition software in all Danish hospitals.\nnone.\nnone.", "Herein, a robust and reproducible eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach is presented, which allows prediction of developmental toxicity, a challenging human-health endpoint in toxicology. The application of XAI as an alternative method is of the utmost importance with developmental toxicity being one of the most animal-intensive areas of regulatory toxicology. In this work, the established CAESAR (Computer Assisted Evaluation of industrial chemical Substances According to Regulations) training set made of 234 chemicals for model learning is employed. Two test sets, including as a whole 585 chemicals, were instead used for validation and generalization purposes. The proposed framework favorably compares with the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, thus resulting in a reliable support system for developmental toxicity ensuring informativeness, uncertainty estimation, generalization, and transparency. Based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm, our predictive model provides easy interpretative keys based on specific molecular descriptors and structural alerts enabling one to distinguish toxic and nontoxic chemicals. Inspired by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) principles for the validation of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) for regulatory purposes, the results are summarized in a standard report in portable document format, enclosing also details concerned with a density-based model applicability domain and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) explainability, the latter particularly useful to better understand the effective roles played by molecular features. Notably, our model has been implemented in TIRESIA (Toxicology Intelligence and Regulatory Evaluations for Scientific and Industry Applications), a free of charge web platform available at http://tiresia.uniba.it.", "Recent decades have witnessed the growing importance of human motion detection systems based on artificial intelligence (AI). The growing interest in human motion detection systems is the advantages of automation in the monitoring of patients remotely and giving warnings to doctors promptly. Currently, wearable devices are frequently used for human motion detection systems. However, such devices have several limitations, such as the elderly not wearing devices due to lack of comfort or forgetfulness and/or battery limitations. To overcome the problems of wearable devices, we propose an AI-driven human motion detection system (deep learning-based system) using channel state information (CSI) extracted from Radio Frequency (RF) signals. The main contribution of this paper is to improve the performance of the deep learning models through techniques, including structure modification and dimension reduction of the original data. In this work, We firstly collected the CSI data with the center frequency 5.32 GHz and implemented the structure of the basic deep learning network in our previous work. After that, we changed the basic deep learning network by increasing the depth, increasing the width, adapting some advanced network structures, and reducing dimensions. After finishing those modifications, we observed the results and analyzed how to further improve the deep learning performance of this contactless AI-enabled human motion detection system. It can be found that reducing the dimension of the original data can work better than modifying the structure of the deep learning model.", "The hype around artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology continues and the number of approved AI tools is growing steadily. Despite the great potential, integration into clinical routine in radiology remains limited. In addition, the large number of individual applications poses a\u00a0challenge for clinical routine, as individual applications have to be selected for different questions and organ systems, which increases the complexity and time required.\nThis review will discuss the current status of validation and implementation of AI tools in clinical routine, and identify possible approaches for an improved assessment of the generalizability of results of AI tools.\nA literature search in various literature and product databases as well as publications, position papers, and reports from various stakeholders was conducted for this review.\nScientific evidence and independent validation studies are available for only a\u00a0few commercial AI tools and the generalizability of the results often remains questionable.\nOne challenge is the multitude of offerings for individual, specific application areas by a\u00a0large number of manufacturers, making integration into the existing site-specific IT infrastructure more difficult. Furthermore, remuneration for the use of AI tools in clinical routine by health insurance companies in Germany is lacking. But in order for reimbursement to be granted, the clinical utility of new applications must first be proven. Such proof, however, is lacking for most applications.\nHINTERGRUND: Der Hype um k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz (KI) in der Radiologie ist ungebrochen, und die Anzahl an zugelassenen KI-Tools w\u00e4chst stetig.

Here we review recent advances applicable to the care of bladder cancer, with an eye towards studies that may suggest next steps in clinical implementation. Algorithms have been applied to clinical records, pathology, and radiology data to generate accurate predictive models for prognosis and clinical outcomes. AI has also shown increasing utility for auto-contouring and efficient creation of workflows involving multiple treatment plans. As technologies progress towards routine clinical use for bladder cancer patients, we also discuss emerging methods to improve interpretability and reliability of algorithms.", "Ventricular premature complex (VPC) is a common arrhythmia\u00a0in clinical practice. VPC could trigger ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation or VPC-induced cardiomyopathy in susceptible patients. Existing screening methods require prolonged monitoring and are limited by cost and low yield when the frequency of VPC is low. Twelve-lead\u00a0electrocardiogram (ECG) is low cost and widely used. We aimed to identify patients with VPC during normal sinus rhythm (NSR) using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-based ECG reading.\nWe developed AI-enabled ECG algorithm using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the ECG signature of VPC presented during NSR using standard 12-lead ECGs. A total of 2515 ECG records from 398 patients with VPC were collected. Among them, only ECG records of NSR without VPC (1617 ECG records) were parsed.\nA total of 753 normal ECG records from 387 patients under NSR were used for comparison. Both image and time-series datasets were parsed for the training process by the CNN models. The computer architectures were optimized to select the best model for the training process. Both the single-input image model (InceptionV3, accuracy: 0.895, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.683-0.937) and multi-input time-series model (ResNet50V2, accuracy: 0.880, 95% CI 0.646-0.943) yielded satisfactory results for VPC prediction, both of which were better than the single-input time-series model (ResNet50V2, accuracy: 0.840, 95% CI 0.629-0.952).\nAI-enabled ECG acquired during NSR permits rapid identification at point of care of individuals with VPC and has the potential to predict VPC episodes automatically rather than traditional long-time monitoring.", "Cognitive science has been traditionally organized around the individual as the basic unit of cognition. Despite developments in areas such as communication, human-machine interaction, group behavior, and community organization, the individual-centric approach heavily dominates both cognitive research and its application. A promising direction for cognitive science is the study of augmented intelligence, or the way social and technological systems interact with and extend individual cognition. The cognitive science of augmented intelligence holds promise in helping society tackle major real-world challenges that can only be discovered and solved by teams made of individuals and machines with complementary skills who can productively collaborate with each other.", "Shock management requires quick and reliable means to monitor the hemodynamic effects of fluid resuscitation. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a relatively quick and non-invasive imaging technique capable of capturing cardiac output (CO) variations in acute settings. However, POCUS is plagued by variable operator skill and interpretation. Artificial intelligence may assist healthcare professionals obtain more objective and precise measurements during ultrasound imaging, thus increasing usability among users with varying experience. In this feasibility study, we compared the performance of novice POCUS users in measuring CO with manual techniques to a novel automation-assisted technique that provides real-time feedback to correct image acquisition for optimal aortic outflow velocity measurement.\n28 junior critical care trainees with limited experience in POCUS performed manual and automation-assisted CO measurements on a single healthy volunteer. CO measurements were obtained using left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocity time integral (VTI) and LVOT diameter. Measurements obtained by study subjects were compared to those taken by board-certified echocardiographers. Comparative analyses were performed using Spearman's rank correlation and Bland-Altman matched-pairs analysis.\nAdequate image acquisition was 100% feasible. The correlation between manual and automated VTI values was not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.11) and means from both groups underestimated the mean values obtained by board-certified echocardiographers. Automated measurements of VTI in the trainee cohort were found to have more reproducibility, narrower measurement range (6.2 vs. 10.3\u00a0cm), and reduced standard deviation (1.98 vs. 2.33\u00a0cm) compared to manual measurements. The coefficient of variation across raters was 11.5%, 13.6% and 15.4% for board-certified echocardiographers, automated, and manual VTI tracing, respectively.\nOur study demonstrates that novel automation-assisted VTI is feasible and can decrease variability while increasing precision in CO measurement. These results support the use of artificial intelligence-augmented image acquisition in routine critical care ultrasound and may have a role for evaluating the response of CO to hemodynamic interventions. Further investigations into artificial intelligence-assisted ultrasound systems in clinical settings are warranted.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) facilitates scientists to devise intelligent machines that work and behave like humans to resolve difficulties and problems by utilizing minimal resources. The Healthcare sector has benefited due to this. Mosquito-transmitted diseases pose a significant health risk. Despite all advances, present strategies for curbing these diseases still depend largely on controlling the mosquito vectors. This strategy demands an army of entomology experts for thorough monitoring, determining, and finally eradicating the targeted mosquito population. Deep learning (DL) algorithms may substitute such unmanageable processes. The current review focuses on how AI, with particular emphasis on deep learning, demonstrates effectiveness in quick detection, identification, monitoring, and finally controlling the target mosquito populations with minimal resources. It accelerates the pace of operation and data exploration on ongoing evolutionary status, tendency to feed blood, and age grading of mosquitoes.

Mobile apps based on predictive machine learning models have the potential to improve health outcomes, but there is still no consensus on how to inform doctors about their results. The aim of this study was to investigate how healthcare professionals prefer to receive predictions generated by machine learning algorithms. A systematic search in MEDLINE, via PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science was first performed. We developed a mobile app, RandomIA, to predict the occurrence of clinical outcomes, initially for COVID-19 and later expected to be expanded to other diseases. A questionnaire called System Usability Scale (SUS) was selected to assess the usability of the mobile app. A total of 69 doctors from the five regions of Brazil tested RandomIA and evaluated three different ways to visualize the predictions. For prognostic outcomes (mechanical ventilation, admission to an intensive care unit, and death), most doctors (62.9%) preferred a more complex visualization, represented by a bar graph with three categories (low, medium, and high probability) and a probability density graph for each outcome. For the diagnostic prediction of COVID-19, there was also a majority preference (65.4%) for the same option. Our results indicate that doctors could be more inclined to prefer receiving detailed results from predictive machine learning algorithms.", "Due to the coronavirus pandemic international conflicts, dramatic changes of daily living have been enforced, including new ways of providing patient assistance, based on artificial intelligence.

These achievements led us to develop a new application, being still in the testing phase, which has a positive impact on mental healthcare issues. It is a conversational system capable to diagnose people's negative, depressive, and anxious emotions during chatting, and to act as a psychological therapist and virtual friend. The proposed system, throughout the conversation, succeeds to decrease the patient's insecurity sentiments, by comforting their mood. In fact, an intelligent assistant for different mental health issues like stress, anxiety and depression, could become a very helpful information system.", "To compare the performances of artificial intelligence (AI) to those of radiologists in wrist fracture detection on radiographs.\nThis retrospective study included 637 patients (1917 radiographs) with wrist trauma between January 2017 and December 2019. The AI software used was a deep neuronal network algorithm. Ground truth was established by three senior musculoskeletal radiologists who compared the initial radiology reports (IRR) made by non-specialized radiologists, the results of AI, and the combination of AI and IRR (IR+AI) RESULTS: A total of 318 fractures were reported by the senior radiologists in 247 patients. Sensitivity of AI (83%; 95% CI: 78-87%) was significantly greater than that of IRR (76%; 95% CI: 70-81%) (p < 0.001). Specificities were similar for AI (96%; 95% CI: 93-97%) and for IRR (96%; 95% CI: 94-98%) (p = 0.80). The combination of AI+IRR had a significantly greater sensitivity (88%; 95% CI: 84-92%) compared to AI and IRR (p < 0.001) and a lower specificity (92%; 95% CI: 89-95%) (p < 0.001). The sensitivity for scaphoid fracture detection was acceptable for AI (84%) and IRR (80%) but poor for the detection of other carpal bones fracture (41% for AI and 26% for IRR).\nPerformance of AI in wrist fracture detection on radiographs is better than that of non-specialized radiologists. The combination of AI and radiologist's analysis yields best performances.\n\u2022 Artificial intelligence has better performances for wrist fracture detection compared to non-expert radiologists in daily practice. \u2022 Performance of artificial intelligence greatly differs depending on the anatomical area. \u2022 Sensitivity of artificial intelligence for the detection of carpal bones fractures is 56%.", "Massive transfusion is essential to prevent complications during uncontrolled intraoperative hemorrhage. As massive transfusion requires time for blood product preparation and additional medical personnel for a team-based approach, early prediction of massive transfusion is crucial for appropriate management.\nTo evaluate a real-time prediction model for massive transfusion during surgery based on the incorporation of preoperative data and intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring data.\nThis prognostic study used data sets from patients who underwent surgery with invasive blood pressure monitoring at Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) from 2016 to 2019 and Boramae Medical Center (BMC) from 2020 to 2021. SNUH represented the development and internal validation data sets (n\u2009=\u200917\u202f986 patients), and BMC represented the external validation data sets (n\u2009=\u2009494 patients). Data were analyzed from November 2020 to December 2021.\nA deep learning-based real-time prediction model for massive transfusion.\nMassive transfusion was defined as a transfusion of 3 or more units of red blood cells over an hour. A preoperative prediction model for massive transfusion was developed using preoperative variables. Subsequently, a real-time prediction model using preoperative and intraoperative parameters was constructed to predict massive transfusion 10 minutes in advance. A prediction model, the massive transfusion index, calculated the risk of massive transfusion in real time.\nAmong 17\u202f986 patients at SNUH (mean [SD] age, 58.65 [14.81] years; 9036 [50.2%] female), 416 patients (2.3%) underwent massive transfusion during the operation (mean [SD] duration of operation, 170.99 [105.03] minutes). The real-time prediction model constructed with the use of preoperative and intraoperative parameters significantly outperformed the preoperative prediction model (area under the receiver characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.972; 95% CI, 0.968-0.976 vs AUROC, 0.824; 95% CI, 0.813-0.834 in the SNUH internal validation data set; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Patients with the highest massive transfusion index (ie, >90th percentile) had a 47.5-fold increased risk for a massive transfusion compared with those with a lower massive transfusion index (ie, <80th percentile). The real-time prediction model also showed excellent performance in the external validation data set (AUROC of 0.943 [95% CI, 0.919-0.961] in BMC).\nThe findings of this prognostic study suggest that the real-time prediction model for massive transfusion showed high accuracy of prediction performance, enabling early intervention for high-risk patients. It suggests strong confidence in artificial intelligence-assisted clinical decision support systems in the operating field.", "Genitourinary (GU) system is among the most commonly involved malignancy sites in the human body. Imaging plays a crucial role not only in diagnosis of cancer but also in disease management and its prognosis.

The quality of studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 table of diagnostic test quality evaluation criteria. The random-effects model was calculated using Meta-DISC 1.4 and RevMan 5.3.\nA total of 16 studies were included for meta-analysis. Only one study (1/16) presented externally validated results. The area under the curve (AUC) of AI group, expert group and non-expert group for detection and classification of colonic polyps were 0.940, 0.918, and 0.871, respectively. AI group had slightly lower pooled specificity than the expert group (79% vs. 86%, P\u2009<\u20090.05), but the pooled sensitivity was higher than the expert group (88% vs. 80%, P\u2009<\u20090.05). While the non-experts had less pooled specificity in polyp recognition than the experts (81% vs. 86%, P\u2009<\u20090.05), and higher pooled sensitivity than the experts (85% vs. 80%, P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nThe performance of AI in polyp detection and classification is similar to that of human experts, with high sensitivity and moderate specificity.

However, the therapeutic efficiency of inorganic nanoparticles is greatly hampered by the complex tumor microenvironment, patient heterogeneity, and systemic nonspecific toxicity. The biomimetic technology based on biological membranes (cell- or bacteria-derived membranes) is a promising strategy to confer unique characteristics to inorganic nanoparticles, such as superior biocompatibility, prolonged circulation time, immunogenicity, homologous tumor targeting, and flexible engineering approaches on the surface, resulting in the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of inorganic nanoparticles against cancer. Therefore, a greater push toward developing biomimetic-based nanotechnology could increase the specificity and potency of inorganic nanoparticles for effective cancer treatment. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in biological membrane-coated inorganic nanoparticles in cancer precise therapy and highlight the different types of engineered approaches, applications, mechanisms, and future perspectives. The surface engineering of biological membrane can greatly enhance their targeting, intelligence, and functionality, thereby realizing stronger tumor therapy effects. Further advances in materials science, biomedicine, and oncology can facilitate the clinical translation of biological membrane-coated inorganic nanoparticles.", "Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are novel technologies that will change the way veterinary medicine is practiced. Exactly how this change will occur is yet to be determined, and, as is the nature with disruptive technologies, will be difficult to predict. Ushering in this new tool in a conscientious way will require knowledge of the terminology and types of AI as well as forward thinking regarding the ethical and legal implications within the profession. Developers as well as end users will need to consider the ethical and legal components alongside functional creation of algorithms in order to foster acceptance and adoption, and most importantly to prevent patient harm. There are key differences in deployment of these technologies in veterinary medicine relative to human healthcare, namely our ability to perform euthanasia, and the lack of regulatory validation to bring these technologies to market. These differences along with others create a much different landscape than AI use in human medicine, and necessitate proactive planning in order to prevent catastrophic outcomes, encourage development and adoption, and protect the profession from unnecessary liability. The authors offer that deploying these technologies prior to considering the larger ethical and legal implications and without stringent validation is putting the AI cart before the horse, and risks putting patients and the profession in harm's way.", "Nuclear energy plays an important role in global energy supply, especially as a key low-carbon source of power. However, safe operation is very critical in nuclear power plants (NPPs). Given the significant impact of human-caused errors on three serious nuclear accidents in history, artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly been used in assisting operators with regard to making various decisions. In particular, data-driven AI algorithms have been used to identify the presence of accidents and their root causes. However, there is a lack of an open NPP accident dataset for measuring the performance of various algorithms, which is very challenging. This paper presents a first-of-its-kind open dataset created using PCTRAN, a pre-developed and widely used simulator for NPPs. The dataset, namely nuclear power plant accident data (NPPAD), basically covers the common types of accidents in typical pressurised water reactor NPPs, and it contains time-series data on the status or actions of various subsystems, accident types, and severity information. Moreover, the dataset incorporates other simulation data (e.g., radionuclide data) for conducting research beyond accident diagnosis.", "To develop an artificial intelligence-based model to predict recurrence after curative resection for stage I-III colorectal cancer from digitized pathological slides.\nIn this retrospective study, 471 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for stage I-III colorectal cancer at our institution from 2004 to 2015 were enrolled, and 512 randomly selected tiles from digitally scanned images of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tumor tissue sections were used to train a convolutional neural network. Five-fold cross-validation was used to validate the model. The association between recurrence and the model's output scores were analyzed in the test cohorts.\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the cross-validation was 0.7245 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6707-0.7783; P\u2009<\u20090.0001]. The score successfully classified patients into those with better and worse recurrence free survival (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that a high score was significantly associated with worse recurrence free survival [odds ratio (OR) 1.857; 95% CI 1.248-2.805; P\u2009=\u20090.0021], which was independent from other predictive factors: male sex (P\u2009=\u20090.0238), rectal cancer (P\u2009=\u20090.0396), preoperative abnormal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (P\u2009=\u20090.0216), pathological T3/T4 stage (P\u2009=\u20090.0162), and pathological positive lymph node metastasis (P\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nThe artificial intelligence-based prediction model discriminated patients with a high risk of recurrence. This approach could help decision-makers consider the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy.", "Near-infrared (NIR) synaptic devices integrate NIR optical sensitivity and synaptic plasticity, emulating the basic biomimetic function of the human visual system and showing great potential in NIR artificial vision systems. However, the lack of semiconductor materials with appropriate band gaps for NIR photodetection and effective strategies for fabricating devices with synaptic behaviors limit the further development of NIR synaptic devices. Here, a two-terminal NIR synaptic device consisting of the In2Se3/MoS2 heterojunction has been constructed, and it exhibits fundamental synaptic functions. The reduced band gap and potential barrier of In2Se3/MoS2 heterojunctions are essential for NIR synaptic plasticity. In addition, the NIR synaptic properties of In2Se3/MoS2 heterojunctions under strain have been studied systematically. The \u0394EPSC of the In2Se3/MoS2 synaptic device can be improved from 38.4% under no strain to 49.0% under a 0.54% strain with a 1060 nm illumination for 1 s at 100 mV. Furthermore, the artificial NIR vision system consisting of a 10 \u00d7 10 In2Se3/MoS2 device array has been fabricated, exhibiting image sensing, learning, and storage functions under NIR illumination. This research provides new ideas for the design of flexible NIR synaptic devices based on 2D materials and presents many opportunities in artificial intelligence and NIR vision systems.", "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that predominantly affects the synovial joints, causing joint destruction, pain, and disability. Historically, the standard for measuring the long-term efficacy of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs has been the assessment of plain radiographs with scoring techniques that quantify joint damage. However, with significant improvements in therapy, current radiographic scoring systems may no longer be fit for purpose for the milder spectrum of disease seen today. We argue that artificial intelligence is an apt solution to further improve upon radiographic scoring, as it can readily learn to recognize subtle patterns in imaging data to not only improve efficiency, but can also increase the sensitivity to variation in mild disease. Current work in the area demonstrates the feasibility of automating scoring but is yet to take full advantage of the strengths of artificial intelligence. By fully leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, faster and more sensitive scoring could enable the ongoing development of effective treatments for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.", "Researchers across cognitive, neuro- and computer sciences increasingly reference 'human-like' artificial intelligence and 'neuroAI'. However, the scope and use of the terms are often inconsistent. Contributed research ranges widely from mimicking behaviour, to testing machine learning methods as neurally plausible hypotheses at the cellular or functional levels, or solving engineering problems. However, it cannot be assumed nor expected that progress on one of these three goals will automatically translate to progress in others. Here, a simple rubric is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility or benchmark/engineering/computer science goals. This is clarified using examples of weak and strong neuroAI and human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate and corrective ways in which the three dimensions interact with one another. The author maintains that future progress in artificial intelligence will need strong interactions across the disciplines, with iterative feedback loops and meticulous validity tests-leading to both known and yet-unknown advances that may span decades to come. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'New approaches to 3D vision'.", "Healthcare has well-known challenges with safety, quality, and effectiveness, and many see artificial intelligence (AI) as essential to any solution. Emerging applications include the automated synthesis of best-practice research evidence including systematic reviews, which would ultimately see all clinical trial data published in a computational form for immediate synthesis. Digital scribes embed themselves in the process of care to detect, record, and summarize events and conversations for the electronic record. However, three persistent translational challenges must be addressed before AI is widely deployed. First, little effort is spent replicating AI trials, exposing patients to risks of methodological error and biases. Next, there is little reporting of patient harms from trials. Finally, AI built using machine learning may perform less effectively in different clinical settings.", "The aim of this study is to check the practical feasibility of artificial intelligence for day-to-day operations and how it generalizes when the data have considerable interobserver variability.\nAutomated delineation of organ at risk (OAR) using a deep learning model is reasonably accurate. This will considerably reduce the medical professional time in manually contouring the OAR and also reduce the interobserver variation among radiation oncologists. It allows for quick radiation planning which helps in adaptive radiotherapy planning.\nHead and neck (HN) computed tomography (CT) scan data of 113 patients were used in this study. CT scan was done as per the institute protocol. Each patient had about 100-300 slices in Dicom format. A total number of 19,240 images were used as the data set. The OARs were delineated by the radiation oncologist in the contouring system. Of the 113 patient records, 13 records were kept aside as test dataset and the remaining 100 records were used for training the UNet 2D model. The study was performed on the spinal cord and left and right parotids as OARs on HN CT images. The model performance was quantified using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) score.\nThe trained model is used to predict three OARs, spinal cord and left and right parotids. The DSC score of 84% and above could be achieved using the UNet 2D Convolutional Neural Network.\nThis study showed that the accuracy of predicted organs was within acceptable DSC scores, even when the underlying dataset has significant interobserver variability.", "In the last couple of years, videoconferencing platforms have become very popular and have captured the attention of researchers and the public, particularly due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Immediately after the pandemic started in the spring of 2020, demand for video conferencing apps has grown exponentially. This demand, and the emergence of new needs, have forced manufacturers to adapt to the new context by improving the services offered and adding new features to existing applications. Many new video conferencing applications have also emerged with this demand. This paper presents a series of statistics on the evolution during the pandemic and the current status of the main video conferencing systems. The different ways in which these systems have integrated artificial intelligence technologies to address different identified problems and user needs are also presented.", "The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of three models for detecting hydronephrosis through ultrasound images using state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. The diagnosis of hydronephrosis is challenging because of varying and non-specific presentations. With the characteristics of ready accessibility, no radiation exposure and repeated assessments, point-of-care ultrasound becomes a complementary diagnostic tool for hydronephrosis; however, inter-observer variability still exists after time-consuming training. Artificial intelligence has the potential to overcome the human limitations. A total of 3462 ultrasound frames for 97 patients with hydronephrosis confirmed by the expert nephrologists were included. One thousand six hundred twenty-eight ultrasound frames were also extracted from the 265 controls who had normal renal ultrasonography. We built three deep learning models based on U-Net, Res-UNet and UNet++ and compared their performance. We applied pre-processing techniques including wiping the background to lessen interference by YOLOv4 and standardizing image sizes. Also, post-processing techniques such as adding filter for filtering the small effusion areas were used. The Res-UNet algorithm had the best performance with an accuracy of 94.6% for moderate/severe hydronephrosis with substantial recall rate, specificity, precision, F1 measure and intersection over union. The Res-UNet algorithm has the best performance in detection of moderate/severe hydronephrosis. It would decrease variability among sonographers and improve efficiency under clinical conditions.", "The visual classification of cell images according to differences in the spatial patterns of subcellular structure is an important methodology in cell and developmental biology. Experimental perturbation of cell function can induce changes in the spatial distribution of organelles and their associated markers or labels. Here, we demonstrate how to achieve accurate, unbiased, high-throughput image classification using an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. We show that a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm can classify distinct patterns of Golgi images after drug or siRNA treatments, and we review our methods from cell preparation to image acquisition and CNN analysis.", "New technologies enable the creation of digital twin systems (DTS) combining continuous data collection from children's home and artificial intelligence (AI)-based recommendations to adapt their care in real time. The objective was to assess whether children and adolescents with asthma would be ready to use such DTS. A mixed-method study was conducted with 104 asthma patients aged 8 to 17\u00a0years. The potential advantages and disadvantages associated with AI and the use of DTS were collected in semi-structured interviews. Children were then asked whether they would agree to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma. The strength of their decision was assessed as well as the factors determining their choice. The main advantages of DTS identified by children were the possibility to be (i) supported in managing their asthma (ii) from home and (iii) in real time. Technical issues and the risk of loss of humanity were the main drawbacks reported. Half of the children (56%) were willing to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma if it was as effective as current care, and up to 93% if it was more effective. Those with the best computer skills were more likely to choose the DTS, while those who placed a high value on the physician-patient relationship were less likely to do so.\u00a0 \u00a0Conclusions: The majority of children were ready to use a DTS for the management of their asthma, particularly if it was more effective than current care. The results of this study support the development of DTS for childhood asthma and the evaluation of their effectiveness in clinical trials. What is Known: \u2022 New technologies enable the creation of digital twin systems (DTS) for children with asthma. \u2022 Acceptance of these DTSs by children with asthma is unknown. What is New: \u2022 Half of the children (56%) were willing to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma if it was as effective as current care, and up to 93% if it was more effective. \u2022Children identified the ability to be supported from home and in real time as the main benefits of DTS.", "Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide affecting mainly low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, the objective is to analyze the bibliometric characteristics of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in tuberculosis in Scopus.\nA bibliometric study, the Scopus database was used using a search strategy composed of controlled and free terms regarding tuberculosis and AI. The search fields \"TITLE,\" \"ABSTRACT,\" and \"AUTHKEY\" were used to find the terms. The collected data were analyzed with Scival software. Bibliometric data were described through the figures and tables summarized by absolute values and percentages.\nThousand and forty-one documents were collected and analyzed. Yudong Zhang was the author with the highest scientific production; however, K. C. Santosh had the greatest impact. Anna University (India) was the institution with the highest number of published papers. Most papers were published in the first quartile. The United States led the scientific production. Articles with international collaboration had the highest impact.\nArticles related to tuberculosis and AI are mostly published in first quartile journals, which would reflect the need and interest worldwide. Although countries with a high incidence of new cases of tuberculosis are among the most productive, those with the highest reported drug resistance need greater support and collaboration.", "The N7-methylguanosine modification (m7G) of the 5' cap structure in the mRNA plays a crucial role in gene expression. However, the relation between m7G and tumor immune remains unclear. Hence, we intended to perform a pan-cancer analysis of m7G which can help explore the underlying mechanism and contribute to predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM\u00a0/ 3PM).\nThe gene expression, genetic variation, clinical information, methylation, and digital pathological section from 33 cancer types were downloaded from the TCGA database. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to validate the expression of the m7G regulator genes (m7RGs) hub-gene. The m7G score was calculated by single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis. The association of m7RGs with copy number variation, clinical features, immune-related genes, TMB, MSI, and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) was comprehensively assessed. CellProfiler was used to extract pathological section characteristics. XGBoost and random forest were used to construct the m7G score prediction model. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to assess the activation state of the m7G in the tumor microenvironment.\nThe m7RGs were highly expressed in tumors and most of the m7RGs are risk factors for prognosis. Moreover, the cellular pathway enrichment analysis suggested that m7G score was closely associated with invasion, cell cycle, DNA damage, and repair. In several cancers, m7G score was significantly negatively correlated with MSI and TMB and positively correlated with TIDE, suggesting an ICB marker potential. XGBoost-based pathomics model accurately predicts m7G scores with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.97. Analysis of scRNA-seq suggests that m7G differs significantly among cells of the tumor microenvironment. IHC confirmed high expression of EIF4E in breast cancer. The m7G prognostic model can accurately assess the prognosis of tumor patients with an AUC of 0.81, which was publicly hosted at https://pan-cancer-m7g.shinyapps.io/Panca-m7g/.\nThe current study explored for the first time the m7G in pan-cancer and identified m7G as an innovative marker in predicting clinical outcomes and immunotherapeutic efficacy, with the potential for deeper integration with PPPM. Combining m7G within the framework of PPPM will provide a unique opportunity for clinical intelligence and new approaches.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13167-022-00305-1.", "Visualization techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) are currently used for intubation device. By providing airway visualization during tracheal intubation, the technologies provide safe and accurate access to the trachea. The ability of AI to automatically identify airways from images of intubation device makes it attractive for use in intubation devices. The purpose of this review is to introduce the state of application of visualization techniques and AI in certain intubation devices. We reviewed the evidence of clinical implications of the use of video-assisted intubation device in the intubation time, first attempt success rate, and intubation of the difficult airway. Especially, VivaSight single-lumen tube with an incorporated optics allows direct viewing of the airway. VivaSight single-lumen tube has more advantages in tracheal intubation. AI has been applied to fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) and video laryngoscope with automatic airway image recognition, and has achieved certain accomplishment. Further, we discussed the possibility of applying AI to the VivaSight single-lumen tube and proposed future directions of research and application.", "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a promising approach to improving fibromyalgia (FM) symptoms, including cognitive impairment. So, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of home-based tDCS in treating cognitive impairment. Besides, we explored if the severity of dysfunction of the Descendant Pain Modulation System (DPMS) predicts the tDCS effect and if its effect is linked to changes in neuroplasticity as measured by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).\nThis randomized, double-blind, parallel, sham-controlled clinical trial, single-center, included 36 women with FM, aged from 30 to 65 years old, assigned 2:1 to receive a-tDCS (n = 24) and s-tDCS (n = 12). The primary outcome was the Trail Making Test's assessment of executive attention, divided attention, working memory (WM), and cognitive flexibility (TMT-B-A). The secondary outcomes were the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), the WM by Digits subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III), and quality of life. Twenty-minute daily sessions of home-based tDCS for 4 weeks (total of 20 sessions), 2 mA anodal-left (F3) and cathodal-right (F4) prefrontal stimulation with 35 cm2 carbon electrodes.\nGLM showed a main effect for treatment in the TMT-B-A [Wald \u03c72 = 6.176; Df = 1; P = 0.03]. The a-tDCS improved cognitive performance. The effect size estimated by Cohen's d at treatment end in the TMT-B-A scores was large [-1.48, confidence interval (CI) 95% = -2.07 to-0.90]. Likewise, the a-tDCS effects compared to s-tDCS improved performance in the WM, verbal and phonemic fluency, and quality-of-life scale. The impact of a-tDCS on the cognitive tests was positively correlated with the reduction in serum BDNF from baseline to treatment end. Besides, the decrease in the serum BDNF was positively associated with improving the quality of life due to FM symptoms.\nThese findings revealed that daily treatment with a home-based tDCS device over l-DLPFC compared to sham stimulation over 4 weeks improved the cognitive impairment in FM. The a-tDCS at home was well-tolerated, underlining its potential as an alternative treatment for cognitive dysfunction. Besides, the a-tDCS effect is related to the severity of DPMS dysfunction and changes in neuroplasticity state.\n[www.ClinicalTrials.gov], identifier [NCT03843203].", "Rationale: Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis imparts high accuracy to chest radiography (CXR) interpretation; however, its benefit for nonradiologist physicians in detecting lung lesions on CXR remains unclear. Objectives: To investigate whether AI assistance improves the diagnostic performance of physicians for CXR interpretation and affects their clinical decisions in clinical practice. Methods: We randomly allocated eligible patients who visited an outpatient clinic to the intervention (with AI-assisted interpretation) and control (without AI-assisted interpretation) groups. Lung lesions on CXR were recorded by seven nonradiologists with or without AI assistance. The reference standard for lung lesions was established by three radiologists. The primary and secondary endpoints were the physicians' diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision, respectively. Results: Between October 2020 and May 2021, 162 and 161 patients were assigned to the intervention and control groups, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was significantly larger in the intervention group than in the control group for the CXR level (0.840 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.778-0.903] vs. 0.718 [95% CI, 0.640-0.796]; P\u2009=\u20090.017) and lung lesion level (0.800 [95% CI, 0.740-0.861] vs. 0.677 [95% CI, 0.605-0.750]; P\u2009=\u20090.011). The intervention group had higher sensitivity in terms of both CXR and lung lesion level and a lower false referral rate for the lung lesion level. AI-assisted CXR interpretation did not affect the physicians' clinical decisions. Conclusions: AI-assisted CXR interpretation improves the diagnostic performance of nonradiologist physicians in detecting abnormal lung findings. Clinical trial registered with Clinical Research Information Service of the Republic of Korea (KCT 0005466).", "Although automatic artificial intelligence (AI) coronary angiography (CAG) segmentation is arguably the first step toward future clinical application, it is underexplored. We aimed to (1) develop AI models for CAG segmentation and (2) assess the results using similarity scores and a set of criteria defined by expert physicians.\nPatients undergoing CAG were randomly selected in a retrospective study at a single center. Per incidence, an ideal frame was segmented, forming a baseline human dataset (BH), used for training a baseline AI model (BAI). Enhanced human segmentation (EH) was created by combining the best of both. An enhanced AI model (EAI) was trained using the EH. Results were assessed by experts using 11 weighted criteria, combined into a Global Segmentation Score (GSS: 0-100 points). Generalized Dice Score (GDS) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) were also used for AI models assessment.\n1664 processed images were generated. GSS for BH, EH, BAI and EAI were 96.9+/-5.7; 98.9+/-3.1; 86.1+/-10.1 and 90+/-7.6, respectively (95% confidence interval, p<0.001 for both paired and global differences). The GDS for the BAI and EAI was 0.9234\u00b10.0361 and 0.9348\u00b10.0284, respectively. The DSC for the coronary tree was 0.8904\u00b10.0464 and 0.9134\u00b10.0410 for the BAI and EAI, respectively. The EAI outperformed the BAI in all coronary segmentation tasks, but performed less well in some catheter segmentation tasks.\nWe successfully developed AI models capable of CAG segmentation, with good performance as assessed by all scores.", "Conversational agents (CAs; computer programs that use artificial intelligence to simulate a conversation with users through natural language) have evolved considerably in recent years to support healthcare by providing autonomous, interactive, and accessible services, making them potentially useful for supporting smoking cessation. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an overarching evaluation of their effectiveness and acceptability to inform future development and adoption.\nPsycInfo, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Medline, EMBASE, Communication and Mass Media Complete, and CINAHL Complete were searched for studies examining the use of CAs for smoking cessation. Data from eligible studies were extracted and used for random-effects meta-analyses.\nThe search yielded 1245 publications with 13 studies eligible for systematic review (total N\u2005=\u20058236) and six studies for random-effects meta-analyses. All studies reported positive effects on cessation-related outcomes. A meta-analysis with randomized controlled trials reporting on abstinence yielded a sample-weighted odds ratio of 1.66 (95% CI = 1.33% to 2.07%, p\u2005<\u2005.001), favoring CAs over comparison groups. A narrative synthesis of all included studies showed overall high acceptability, while some barriers were identified from user feedback. Overall, included studies were diverse in design with mixed quality, and evidence of publication bias was identified. A lack of theoretical foundations was noted, as well as a clear need for relational communication in future designs.\nThe effectiveness and acceptability of CAs for smoking cessation are promising. However, standardization of reporting and designing of the agents is warranted for a more comprehensive evaluation.\nThis is the first systematic review to provide insight into the use of CAs to support smoking cessation. Our findings demonstrated initial promise in the effectiveness and user acceptability of these agents. We also identified a lack of theoretical and methodological limitations to improve future study design and intervention delivery.", "Industry 4.0 technologies are expected to enhance healthcare quality at the minimum cost feasible by using innovative solutions based on a fruitful exchange of knowledge and resources among institutions, firms and academia. These collaborative mechanisms are likely to occur in an innovation ecosystem where different stakeholders and resources interact to provide ground-breaking solutions to the market. The paper proposes a framework for studying the creation and development of innovation ecosystems in the healthcare sector by using a set of interrelated dimensions including, technology, value, and capabilities within a Triple-Helix model guided by focal actors. The model is applied to an exemplary Italian innovation ecosystem providing cloud and artificial intelligence-based solutions to general practitioners (GPs) under the focal role of the Italian association of GPs. Primary and secondary data are examined starting from the innovation ecosystem's origins and continuing until the COVID-19 crisis. The findings show that the pandemic represented the turning point that altered the ecosystem's dimensions in order to find immediate solutions for monitoring health conditions and organizing the booking of swabs and vaccines. The data triangulation points out the technical, organizational, and administrative barriers hindering the widespread adoption of these solutions at the national and regional levels, revealing several implications for health policy.", "Shoulder instability is a common injury, with a reported incidence of 23.9 per 100\u2009000 person-years. There is still an ongoing debate on the most effective treatment strategy. Non-operative treatment has recurrence rates of up to 60%, whereas operative treatments such as the Bankart repair and bone block procedures show lower recurrence rates (16% and 2%, respectively) but higher complication rates (<2%\u2009and up to 30%, respectively). Methods to determine risk of recurrence have been developed; however, patient-specific decision-making tools are still lacking. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms use self-learning complex models that can be used to make patient-specific decision-making tools. The aim of the current study is to develop and train a machine learning algorithm to create a prediction model to be used in clinical practice-as an online prediction tool-to estimate recurrence rates following a Bankart repair.\nThis is a multicentre retrospective cohort study. Patients with traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations that were treated with an arthroscopic Bankart repair without remplissage will be included. This study includes two parts. Part 1, collecting all potential factors influencing the recurrence rate following an arthroscopic Bankart repair in patients using multicentre data, aiming to include data from >1000 patients worldwide. Part 2, the multicentre data will be re-evaluated (and where applicable complemented) using machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes. Recurrence will be the primary outcome measure.\nFor safe multicentre data exchange and analysis, our Machine Learning Consortium adhered to the WHO regulation 'Policy on Use and Sharing of Data Collected by WHO in Member States Outside the Context of Public Health Emergencies'. The study results will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal. No Institutional Review Board is required for this study.", "In this study, the enzyme consortium of endoglucanase, lipase, and amylase was obtained and optimized using artificial intelligence-based tools. After optimization using a multi-objective genetic algorithm and artificial neural network, the enzyme activity was 8.8\u00a0IU/g, 153.68 U/g, and 19.2\u00a0IU/g for endoglucanase, lipase, and amylase, respectively, using Thermomyces lanuginosus VAPS25. The highest enzyme activity was obtained at parameters 77.69% moisture content, 52.7\u00a0\u00b0C temperature, 98\u00a0h, and 3.1 eucalyptus leaves: wheat bran ratio. The endoglucanase-lipase-amylase (END-LIP-AMY) enzyme consortium showed reliable characteristics in terms of catalytic activity at 50-80\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 6.0-9.0. The increase in deinking efficiency of 27.8% and 11.1% were obtained compared to control for mixed office waste and old newspaper, respectively, using the enzyme consortium. The surface chemical composition and fiber morphology of deinked pulp was investigated using Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM).", "The last two decades have witnessed an extraordinary evolution of automation and artificial intelligence (AI), which has become an integral part of our daily lives. Lately, AI has also been assimilated in the field of medicine to upgrade overall healthcare system and encourage personalized treatment. Theranostics literally meaning combination of diagnosis and therapeutics, is a targeted pharmacotherapy, based on specific targeted diagnostic tests. Numerous theranostic agents/biomarkers are available which can identify the most beneficial treatment, correct dose or predict response to a medicine, thus, maximizing drug efficacy, minimizing toxicity and providing informed treatment choice. For instance, a statistics based Cluster-FLIM technology provides precise data on drug-receptor binding behavior in biological tissues using fluorescence real experimental imaging. Automated Idylla\u2122 qPCR System is another approach in oncology to determine the EGFR mutations at initial stage as well as during the treatment and also assists the oncologist in designing the treatment protocol. Recent incorporation of automation and AI in theranostics has brought a drastic change in early detection and treatment protocols for various diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Also, it leads to quick analysis of number of diverse experimental datum with accuracy. The approach mainly uses computer algorithms to unveil relevant and significant information from clinical data, thereby assisting in making accurate, logical and pertinent decisions. This review highlights the emerging uses/role of automation and AI in theranostics, technical difficulties and focuses on its future prospects to facilitate a patient specific, reliable and efficient pharmacotherapy.", "The need for precise and early diagnosis of malaria and its distinction from other febrile illnesses is no doubt a prerequisite, primarily when standard rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) cannot be totally relied upon. At the time of disease outbreaks, the pressure on hospital staff remains high and the chances of human error increase. Therefore, in the era of digitalisation of medicine as well as diagnostic approaches, various technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) should be deployed to further aid the diagnosis, especially in endemic and epidemic situations. Computational techniques are now more at the forefront than ever, and the interest in developing such efficient technologies is continuously increasing. A comprehensive understanding of these digital technologies is needed to maintain the scientific rigour in these attempts. This would enhance the implementation of these novel technologies for malaria diagnosis. This review highlights the progression, strengths, and limitations of various computing techniques so far employed to diagnose malaria.", "5D & 4D printings are an advanced version of 3D printing class and are one of the most revolutionary and powerful fabrication methods used for preparing innovative structures and solid substances using precise additive manufacturing technology. It captures the imagination of one with its potential to produce flexible designing and fabrication of innovative products with high complexity and speed. This technology with the assistance of AI (Artificial Intelligence) facilitates real-time sensing, adapting to change, and predicting the state of printing. 3D printing works by employing advanced materials utilizing a computer aided design with tomography scan under AI control which deposits printing material in accordance with the nature of a file usually in STL format, but it requires time for printing. This shortcoming can be overcome by 4D printing where smart materials are incorporated with time as 4th dimension. This technique has self-repair and self-assembly properties that will save around 80% of time. Some printed materials are made sensitive to temperature, humidity, light, and other parameters so that they can respond to stimulus, but it's one limitation of not being able to print complex shapes having curved surfaces can be overcome by utilising 5D printing where additive manufacturing is done by rotation of extruder head and rotation of print bed to print in 5 different axes. This review evaluates the prospective of these techniques with AI interference in medicine and pharmacy, with its effective and efficient production for the required design precision.", "At present, there are excessive fertilizer use and poor uniformity of fertilizer discharge in corn fertilizer planter. The key difficulty is that accurate perception and control of fertilizer amount has not been solved. Aiming at the above problems, a set of accurate perception and control system applied to corn fertilization planter was studied. According to the difference in dielectric properties between fertilizer and air, a sensor for online detection of fertilizer amount based on capacitance method was designed. And the relationship model of mass flow rate for N, P, K fertilizer and capacitance output was established. In order to reduce the influence of pulsation on fertilization flow, a high-precision fertilizer flow control system for fertilization planter based on the fertilizer flow feedback and PID control method was designed. The validated results showed that the maximum measurement error between the relationship model and capacitance output was 3.75%. As the temperature rises from room temperature to 55\u00b0C, the differential capacitance change rate of the sensor was less than 3%. The steady-state error of fertilizer discharge was less than 2%. The field experiment of the accurate perception and control system for corn fertilization amount show that the electric drive fertilization system has good consistency, the maximum and average variation coefficient of fertilization were 3.74%, 1.6%, respectively, and the variable control accuracy was greater than 97%. The control accuracy of the grain spacing control by electric drive seed metering was 98%. Therefore, the precision fertilization control system in this study can realize high-precision and on-demand fertilization. It is of great significance to realize the intelligence and precision for corn fertilization planter.", "Bioprocess control and optimization are crucial for tapping the metabolic potential of microorganisms, and which have made great progress in the past decades. Combination of the current control and optimization technologies with the latest computer-based strategies will be a worth expecting way to improve bioprocess further. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as a data-driven technique independent of the complex interactions used in mathematical models and has been gradually applied in bioprocess. In this review, firstly, AI-guided modeling approaches of bioprocess are discussed, which are widely applied to optimize critical process parameters (CPPs). Then, AI-assisted rapid detection and monitoring technologies employed in bioprocess are summarized. Next, control strategies according to the above two technologies in bioprocess are analyzed. Lastly, current research gaps and future perspectives on AI-guided optimization and control technologies are discussed. This review provides theoretical guidance for developing AI-guided bioprocess optimization and control technologies.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to countless deaths and widespread global disruptions. Acoustic-based artificial intelligence (AI) tools could provide a simple, scalable, and prompt method to screen for COVID-19 using easily acquirable physiological sounds. These systems have been demonstrated previously and have shown promise but lack robust analysis of their deployment in real-world settings when faced with diverse recording equipment, noise environments, and test subjects. The primary aim of this work is to begin to understand the impacts of these real-world deployment challenges on the system performance. Using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and RelAtive SpecTrAl-Perceptual Linear Prediction (RASTA-PLP) features extracted from cough, speech, and breathing sounds in a crowdsourced dataset, we present a baseline classification system that obtains an average receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.77 when discriminating between COVID-19 and non-COVID subjects. The classifier performance is then evaluated on four additional datasets, resulting in performance variations between 0.64 and 0.87 AUC-ROC, depending on the sound type. By analyzing subsets of the available recordings, it is noted that the system performance degrades with certain recording devices, noise contamination, and with symptom status. Furthermore, performance degrades when a uniform classification threshold from the training data is subsequently used across all datasets. However, the system performance is robust to confounding factors, such as gender, age group, and the presence of other respiratory conditions. Finally, when analyzing multiple speech recordings from the same subjects, the system achieves promising performance with an AUC-ROC of 0.78, though the classification does appear to be impacted by natural speech variations. Overall, the proposed system, and by extension other acoustic-based diagnostic aids in the literature, could provide comparable accuracy to rapid antigen testing but significant deployment challenges need to be understood and addressed prior to clinical use.", "The autonomous generation of routes is an important part of ship intelligence and it can be realized by deep learning of the big data of automatic identification system (AIS) ship trajectories. In this study, to make the routes generated by long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network more accurate and efficient, a ship route autonomous generation scheme is proposed based on AIS ship trajectory big data and improved multi-task LSTM artificial neural network. By introducing an unsupervised trajectory separation mechanism into LSTM, a fast and accurate separation of trajectories with similar paths is realized. In the process of route generation, first of all, a clustering algorithm is used to cluster the trajectories in massive AIS data according to the density of trajectory points, so as to eliminate the trajectories in the routes that do not belong to the target area. Furthermore, the routes are classified according to the type of ships, and then the classified trajectories are processed and used as datasets. Based on these datasets, an improved LSTM algorithm is used to generate ship routes autonomously. The results show the improved LSTM works better than LSTM when the generated route trajectories are short.", "Here is key intelligence on the recommended primary series, boosters, breakthrough infection, adverse events, special population vaccination, vaccine myths, and what the future might hold.", "The purpose of the paper is to create a multidimensional talent management model with embedded aspects of artificial intelligence in the human resource processes to increase employees' engagement and performance of the enterprise.

Specifically, AI technology has tried to overcome the human subjective bias limitations of the traditional approach of the forensic sciences, which include sex prediction and age estimation from morphometric measurements in forensic anthropology or evaluating the third molar stage of development in forensic odontology. Likewise, AI has been studied as an assisting tool in forensic pathology for a quick and easy identification of the taxonomy of diatoms. The present systematic review follows the PRISMA 2020 statements and aims to explore an emerging topic that has been poorly analyzed in the forensic literature. Benefits, limitations, and forensic implications concerning AI are therefore highlighted, by providing an extensive critical review of its current applications on forensic sciences as well as its future directions.

The system uses artificial intelligence to speed up the process of creating adapted plans, comes with its own software solutions and requires a substantially different workflow. A detailed analysis of possible risks of the associated workflow is presented.\nA prospective risk analysis of the adaptive workflow with the Ethos system was performed using Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). An interprofessional team collected possible adverse events and evaluated their severity as well as their chance of occurrence and detectability. Measures to reduce the risks were discussed.\nA total of 122 events were identified, and scored. Within the 20 events with the highest-ranked risks, the following were identified: Challenges due to the stand-alone software solution with very limited connectivity to the existing record and verify software and digital patient file, unfamiliarity with the new software and its limitations and the adaption process relying on results obtained by artificial intelligence. The risk analysis led to the implementation of additional quality assurance measures in the workflow.\nThe thorough analysis of the risks associated with the new treatment technique was the basis for designing details of the workflow. The analysis also revealed challenges to be addressed by both, the vendor and customers. On the vendor side, this includes improving communication between their different software solutions. On the customer side, this especially includes establishing validation strategies to monitor the results of the black box adaption process making use of artificial intelligence.", "Unilateral primary aldosteronism (UPA) and bilateral primary aldosteronism (BPA) are the two subtypes of PA. Discriminating UPA from BPA is of great significance. Although adrenal venous sampling (AVS) is the gold standard for diagnosis, it has shortcomings. Thus, improved methods are needed.\nThe original data were extracted from the public database \"Dryad\". Ten parameters were included to develop prediction models for PA subtype diagnosis using machine learning technology. Moreover, the optimal model was chose and validated in an external dataset.\nIn the modeling dataset, 165 patients (71 UPA, 94 BPA) were included, while in the external dataset, 43 consecutive patients (20 UPA, 23 BPA) were included. The ten parameters utilized in the prediction model include age, sex, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR), serum potassium, ARR after 50 mg captopril challenge test (CCT), primary aldosterone concentration (PAC) after saline infusion test (SIT), PAC reduction rate after SIT, and number of types of antihypertensive agents at diagnosis. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC for the optimal model using the random forest classifier were 90.0%, 81.8%, 96.4%, 0.878, and 0.938, respectively, in the testing dataset and 81.4%, 90.0%, 73.9%, 0.818 and 0.887, respectively, in the validating external dataset. The most important variables contributing to the prediction model were PAC after SIT, ARR, and ARR after CCT.\nWe developed a machine learning-based predictive model for PA subtype diagnosis based on ten clinical parameters without CT imaging. In the future, artificial intelligence-based prediction models might become a robust prediction tool for PA subtype diagnosis, thereby, might reducing at least some of the requests for CT or AVS and assisting clinical decision-making.", "Photodetection is one of the vital functions for the multifunctional \"More than Moore\" (MtM) microchips urgently required by Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The further improvement of the performance of photodetectors faces various challenges, including materials, fabrication processes, and device structures. We demonstrate in this work MoS2 photodetectors with a nanoscale channel length and a back-gate device structure. With the mechanically exfoliated six-monolayer-thick MoS2, a Schottky contact between source/drain electrodes and MoS2, a high responsivity of 4.1 \u00d7 103 A W-1, and a detectivity of 1.34 \u00d7 1013 cm Hz1/2 W-1 at 650 nm were achieved. The devices are also sensitive to multiwavelength lights, including 520 and 405 nm. The electrical and optoelectronic properties of the MoS2 photodetectors were studied in depth, and the working mechanism of the devices was analyzed. The photoinduced Schottky barrier lowering (PIBL) was found to be important for the high performance of the phototransistor.", "In the current era of medical revolution, genomic testing has guided the healthcare fraternity to develop predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine. Predictive screening involves sequencing a whole genome to comprehensively deliver patient care via enhanced diagnostic sensitivity and specific therapeutic targeting. The best example is the application of whole-exome sequencing when identifying aberrant fetuses with healthy karyotypes and chromosomal microarray analysis in complicated pregnancies. To fit into today's clinical practice needs, experimental system biology like genomic technologies, and system biology viz., the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is required to be attuned to the development of preventive and personalized medicine. As diagnostic techniques are advancing, the selection of medical intervention can gradually be influenced by a person's genetic composition or the cellular profiling of the affected tissue. Clinical genetic practitioners can learn a lot about several conditions from their distinct facial traits. Current research indicates that in terms of diagnosing syndromes, facial analysis techniques are on par with those of qualified therapists. Employing deep learning and computer vision techniques, the face image assessment software DeepGestalt measures resemblances to numerous of disorders. Biomarkers are essential for diagnostic, prognostic, and selection systems for developing personalized medicine viz. DNA from chromosome 21 is counted in prenatal blood as part of the Down's syndrome biomarker screening. This review is based on a detailed analysis of the scientific literature via a vigilant approach to highlight the applicability of predictive diagnostics for the development of preventive, targeted, personalized medicine for clinical application in the framework of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3 PM). Additionally, targeted prevention has also been elaborated in terms of gene-environment interactions and next-generation DNA sequencing. The application of 3 PM has been highlighted by an in-depth analysis of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The real-time challenges of genome sequencing and personalized medicine have also been discussed.", "People's commitment to moral principles affects how they self-regulate and directs people down different ethical paths. The Integrity Scale was designed to assess the strength of people's commitment to moral principles. Here, we sought to contribute to evaluating the construct validity of the Integrity Scale. We related the scale to various theoretically relevant criteria including low antagonism features, social-cognitive foundations for morality, self-control, rationality, and self-presentation behavior. Suggestive of the scale's construct validity, the present research showed that scores on the Integrity Scale related to (a) reduced antagonistic-personality features relevant to exploitation and dishonesty more so than immodesty, tough-heartedness, fearlessness, or cynicism; (b) enhanced social-cognitive skills (e.g., cognitive empathy processes); (c) enhanced self-control; (d) enhanced capacities for and reliance on rationality in decision making (e.g., intelligence and cognitive-reflection skill); and (e) enhanced reliance on self-presentation tactics that portray an identity based in high levels of integrity.", "To establish an automatic approach for the measurement of the Cobb angle and the diagnosis of scoliosis on chest radiograph.\nWe developed an artificial intelligence (AI) automatic program which contained a supervised learning module and an inference module. After the filtering and pre-processing process, 96 images from the Shenzhen chest X-ray set were used for training with the supervised learning module, and 491 test images were separately gauged by the AI and the corresponding manual methods. The results of the two methods were further compared through statistical analyses.\nAmong the test images, 6068 (99.49%) vertebral bodies were identified within the deviation of one vertebral segment. The value difference between the Cobb angle obtained by the AI program and that measured by specialists was 0.4020\u00b10.8703. The intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.915 indicated the strong agreement. AI scoliosis diagnosis achieved an accuracy of 98.37%, with a specificity of 98.73%, a sensitivity of 88.24% and a kappa coefficient of 0.781. And the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.979 confirmed the consistency of the two methods in diagnosis.\nWe developed a novel automatic AI method with the abilities to measure the Cobb angle, and to identify the approximate vertebral segment and diagnosis of scoliosis on chest radiograph. The results suggest that this method might be a promising alternative strategy for scoliosis screening on chest radiograph and worth further investigation.", "Deficient air quality in industrial environments creates a number of problems that affect both the staff and the ecosystems of a particular area. To address this, periodic measurements must be taken to monitor the pollutant substances discharged into the atmosphere. However, the deployed system should also be adapted to the specific requirements of the industry. This paper presents a complete air quality monitoring infrastructure based on the IoT paradigm that is fully integrable into current industrial systems. It includes the development of two highly precise compact devices to facilitate real-time monitoring of particulate matter concentrations and polluting gases in the air. These devices are able to collect other information of interest, such as the temperature and humidity of the environment or the Global Positioning System (GPS) location of the device. Furthermore, machine learning techniques have been applied to the Big Data collected by this system. The results identify that the Gaussian Process Regression is the technique with the highest accuracy among the air quality data sets gathered by the devices. This provides our solution with, for instance, the intelligence to predict when safety levels might be surpassed.", "The inception of Industry 4.0 (which includes smart digital technologies and intelligence), as well as the rapidly enforced adoption of the technological revolution due to the lockdown regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic, brought new situational demands, challenges and opportunities for both employees and organizations across the globe. Individuals are required to develop personal enablers (both intrapersonal and intradigital attributes) to optimize their psychological fortitude. Research on the intrapersonal resources needed by employees to have the fortitude to adapt to remote working conditions as a result of the digital era, is currently lacking. The igital era brought about the question of how individuals' career adaptability and career wellbeing (as a set of agile adaptable attributes) relate to their perceptions of the value-oriented psychological contract, and whether these intrapersonal resources can contribute to a psychological fortitude model for remote working employees.\nThis study utilized a survey method to investigate the correlations between agile adaptable attributes and the valueoriented psychological contract of global digital-mindset human resource and financial service organizations. Based on further canonical correlations, structural equation modeling was conducted to develop and recommend a psychological fortitude model for remote working adults in the digital age.\nClose theoretical and empirical associations were found between career adaptability and career wellbeing (as agile adaptable variables) and the perceived value-orientated psychological contract.\nThis study proposed a psychological fortitude model (consisting of intrapersonal resources) that organizations and career practitioners can use as a basis to enhance employees' psychological fortitude in the digital age, as well as for further career research.", "A few decades ago, porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) exerted a major economic impact on the global swine industry, particularly due to the adoption of intensive farming by the latter during the 1980's. Since then, the emerging of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) as major immunosuppressive viruses led to an interaction with other endemic pathogens (e.g., Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, etc.) in swine farms, thereby exacerbating the endemic clinical diseases. We herein, review and discuss various dynamic polymicrobial infections among selected swine pathogens. Traditional biosecurity management strategies through multisite production, parity segregation, batch production, the adoption of all-in all-out production systems, specific vaccination and medication protocols for the prevention and control (or even eradication) of swine diseases are also recommended. After the introduction of the African swine fever (ASF), particularly in Asian countries, new normal management strategies minimizing pig contact by employing automatic feeding systems, artificial intelligence, and robotic farming and reducing the numbers of vaccines are suggested. Re-emergence of existing swine pathogens such as PRRSV or PCV2, or elimination of some pathogens may occur after the ASF-induced depopulation. ASF-associated repopulating strategies are, therefore, essential for the establishment of food security. The \"repopulate swine farm\" policy and the strict biosecurity management (without the use of ASF vaccines) are, herein, discussed for the sustainable management of small-to-medium pig farms, as these happen to be the most potential sources of an ASF re-occurrence. Finally, the ASF disruption has caused the swine industry to rapidly transform itself. Artificial intelligence and smart farming have gained tremendous attention as promising tools capable of resolving challenges in intensive swine farming and enhancing the farms' productivity and efficiency without compromising the strict biosecurity required during the ongoing ASF era.", "Anastomotic leakage (AL) is a fatal complication in patients with rectal cancer after undergoing anterior resection. However, the role of abdominal composition in the development of AL has not been studied.\nTo investigate the relationship between abdominal composition and AL in rectal cancer patients after undergoing anterior resection.\nA retrospective case-matched cohort study was conducted. Complete data for 78 patients with AL were acquired and this cohort was defined as the AL group. The controls were matched for the same sex and body mass index (\u00b1 1 kg/m2). Parameters related to abdominal composition including visceral fat area (VFA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA), subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT), skeletal muscle area (SMA), skeletal muscle index (SMI), abdominal circumference (AC), anterior to posterior diameter of abdominal cavity (APD), and transverse diameter of abdominal cavity (TD) were evaluated based on computed tomography (CT) images using the following Hounsfield Unit (HU) thresholds: SFA: -190 to -30, SMA: -29 to 150, and VFA: -150 to -20. The significance of abdominal composition-related parameters was quantified using feature importance analysis; an artificial intelligence method was used to evaluate the contribution of each included variable.\nTwo thousand two hundred and thirty-eight rectal cancer patients who underwent anterior resection from 2010 to 2020 in a large academic hospital were investigated. Finally, 156 cases were enrolled in the study. Patients in the AL group showed longer operative time (225.03 \u00b1 55.29 vs 207.17 \u00b1 40.80, P = 0.023), lower levels of preoperative hemoglobin (123.32 \u00b1 21.17 vs 132.60 \u00b11 6.31, P = 0.003) and albumin (38.34 \u00b1 4.01 vs 40.52 \u00b1 3.97, P = 0.001), larger tumor size (4.07 \u00b1 1.36 vs 2.76 \u00b1 1.28, P < 0.001), and later cancer stage (P < 0.001) compared to the controls. Patients who developed AL exhibited a larger VFA (125.68 \u00b1 73.59 vs 97.03 \u00b1 57.66, P = 0.008) and a smaller APD (77.30 \u00b1 23.23 vs 92.09 \u00b1 26.40, P < 0.001) and TD (22.90 \u00b1 2.23 vs 24.21 \u00b1 2.90, P = 0.002) compared to their matched controls. Feature importance analysis revealed that TD, APD, and VFA were the three most important abdominal composition-related features.\nAL patients have a higher visceral fat content and a narrower abdominal structure compared to matched controls.", "Currently, the global spread of COVID-19 is taking a heavy toll on the lives of the global population. There is an urgent need to improve and strengthen the coordination of vaccine supply chains in response to this severe pandemic. In this study, we consider a vaccine supply chain based on a combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies and model the supply chain as a two-player dynamic game with inventory level as the dynamic equation of the system. The study focuses on the applicability and effectiveness of the two technologies in the vaccine supply chain and provides management insights. The impact of the application of the technologies on environmental performance is also considered in the model. We also examine factors such as the number of people vaccinated, positive and side effects of vaccines, vaccine decay rate, revenue-sharing/cost-sharing ratio, and commission ratio. The results are as follows: the correlation between the difficulty in obtaining certified vaccines and the profit of a vaccine manufacturer is not monotonous; the vaccine manufacturer is more sensitive to changes in the vaccine attenuation rate. The study's major conclusions are as follows: First, the vaccine supply chain should estimate the level of consumers' difficulty in obtaining a certified vaccine source and the magnitude of the production planning and demand forecasting error terms before adopting the two technologies. Second, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is meaningful in the vaccine supply chain when the error terms satisfy a particular interval condition.", "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients may have different specific neuropsychological deficits related to the location of the tubers. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are common in TSC patients but the relationship between these diagnoses has not been formally explored. In this study we sought to examine brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings in TSC patients with ASD.\nWe evaluated 34 TSC patients on the basis of DSM-V diagnostic criteria for ASD, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R), psychiatrist's examination and also structured parent interviews. The number and localization of the tubers, postcontrast signal characteristics of the tubers, SWI findings, DWI findings on brain MRI were recorded. Demographic features, epilepsy histories, number of antiseizure medications, cognitive status were eveluated also. Patients were divided into two groups: ASD group, which represented group 1 and group 2 consisting of patients without any ASD symptoms.\nIn our study, the mean number of tuber count was 21.8 in patients with ASD patients (Group 1, n\u00a0=\u00a013) and 12.4 in other TSC patients without ASD (Group 2, n\u00a0=\u00a021). Rate of tubers in prefrontal cortex/whole tubers (0.51) in patients with ASD was determined to be higher in group 1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Also a significant difference was detected between generalize epileptiform activities on EEG and the rate of DRE (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) between groups. Cognitive disturbances and infantile spasm history were similar between groups. TSC2 mutations have been identified in 29 (86%) patients.\nThe mean of total tuber count and the rate of the location in the prefrontal cortex were determined to be higher in TSC patients with ASD. Specific areas on brain MRI may help understanding the development of ASD in TSC patients.", "The recurrent and unpredictable nature of seizures can lead to unintentional injuries and even death. The rapid development of electroencephalogram (EEG) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has made it possible to predict seizures in real-time through brain-machine interfaces (BCI), allowing advanced intervention. To date, there is still much room for improvement in predictive seizure models constructed by EEG using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). But, the most critical issue is how to improve the performance and generalization of the model, which involves some confusing conceptual and methodological issues. This review focuses on analyzing several factors affecting the performance of seizure prediction models, focusing on the aspects of post-processing, seizure occurrence period (SOP), seizure prediction horizon (SPH), and algorithms. Furthermore, this study presents some new directions and suggestions for building high-performance prediction models in the future. We aimed to clarify the concept for future research in related fields and improve the performance of prediction models to provide a theoretical basis for future applications of wearable seizure detection devices.", "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell products (eg, tisagenlecleucel [tisa], axicabtagene ciloleucel [axi]) have been used in patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) and in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). After the recent publication of long-term follow-up data in LBCL, reviewing the evidence on this topic is worthwhile. The aim of the present work was to study the pattern of overall survival (OS) reported for CAR T-cell products in LBLC and ALL.\nA standard literature search was performed. OS was studied through an artificial intelligence technique (the Shiny method) that reconstructs individual patient data from published Kaplan-Meier curves. Standard statistics along with indirect comparisons were performed on these reconstructed data. Indirect comparisons focused on CAR T cells versus chemotherapy in LBCL and ALL; tisa and axi were further indirectly compared in LBCL.\nSeven trials were included (4 for LBCL, 3 for ALL). Other populations were selected as control groups. The main results of our analysis were: (1) the survival advantage of CAR T cells is greater in adult patients with ALL than in patients with LBCL; and (2) for LBCL, the survival gain is more substantial for axi compared with tisa.\nOur results are helpful to define the place in therapy of CAR T cells in these 2 disease conditions and also suggest preliminary estimates of cost-effectiveness. One strength of our analysis is that extensive information was available for the treatment options included in indirect comparisons. The main weakness is the inability of the Shiny method to perform multivariate analyses.", "Flexible piezoresistive pressure sensors have promising applications in wearable devices, artificial intelligence, and other fields. However, developing low-cost and high-performance pressure sensors still poses a great challenge. Herein, we utilize low-cost carbon black (CB) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) mixed in porous polydimethylsiloxane to assemble a flexible piezoresistive pressure sensor combined with interdigitated electrodes. Simultaneously, the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation analysis was performed to predict the sensing behavior of the pressure sensor, which was verified by experiments; the preparation of the pressure sensor was guided according to the prediction. Additionally, we studied the effects of the mixed conductive filler's weight ratio, the shape of the interdigital electrode, and the line width and spacing of the interdigital electrode on the performance of the sensor. Based on the interaction of the 3D porous structure and the synergistic conductive network of CB/MWCNTs, the prepared pressure sensor exhibits a high sensitivity of 3.57 kPa-1 (\u223c21 kPa), a wide detection range of 0-275 kPa, fast response time (96 ms), fast recovery time (198 ms), good durability (about 3000 cycles), and good flexibility. Moreover, the fabricated sensor can monitor and recognize human activities (such as finger bending and mouse clicking), indicating that it has great potential in flexible wearable devices and other fields. It is worth noting that the preparation process of the entire pressure sensor was simple, low cost, and environmentally friendly, which provides a certain basis for industrial and commercial applications.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly inheritable neurodevelopmental disorder that causes diverse deficits in social communication and restricted repetitive sensorimotor behaviors. Here, we studied a human-induced pluripotent cell line from an autistic patient with impaired social function and a normal intelligence quotient (IQ\u00a0>\u00a070). The cell line was validated by its morphology, gene expression, and potential to differentiate into three germ layers. This model can be used to explore the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms in patients with ASD, compared those of with patients with normal cognitive abilities.", "There is a noticeable gap in diagnostic evidence strength between the thick and thin scans of Low-Dose CT (LDCT) for pulmonary nodule detection. When the thin scans are needed is unknown, especially when aided with an artificial intelligence nodule detection system.\nA case study is conducted with a set of 1,000 pulmonary nodule screening LDCT scans with both thick (5.0mm), and thin (1.0mm) section\u00a0scans available. Pulmonary nodule detection is performed by human and artificial intelligence models for nodule detection developed using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The intra-sample consistency is evaluated with thick and thin scans, for both clinical doctor and NN (neural network) models. Free receiver operating characteristic (FROC) is used to measure the accuracy of humans and NNs.\nTrained NNs outperform humans with small nodules < 6.0mm, which is a good complement to human ability. For nodules > 6.0mm, human and NNs perform similarly while human takes a fractional advantage. By allowing a few more FPs, a significant sensitivity improvement can be achieved with NNs.\nThere is a performance gap between the thick and thin scans for pulmonary nodule detection regarding both false negatives and false positives. NNs can help reduce false negatives when the nodules are small and trade off the false negatives for sensitivity. A combination of human and trained NNs is a promising way to achieve a fast and accurate diagnosis.", "Monitoring cardiac parameters is the fundamental aspect of every diagnostic process and is facilitated by electrocardiography (ECG) devices. This way, continuous state-of-the-art performance of ECG devices can be ensured. The new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) defines medical device post-market surveillance (PMS) as performed by independent, third-party, notified bodies more strategically in hope to improve traceability of device performance. However, there is still an apparent gap in terms of standardised conformity assessment testing methods.\nThis paper proposes a novel method for conformity assessment testing of ECG devices for post-market surveillance purposes.\nThe method was developed on the basis of International Organisation of Legal Metrology (OIML) guidelines and applied in healthcare institutions from 2018 to 2021.\nThe developed method was validated in healthcare institutions of all levels. The results obtained during validation suggest that conformity assessment testing of the ECG device as a method used during PMS contributes to significant improvement in devices' accuracy and reliability.\nA standardized approach in conformity assessment testing of ECG devices during PMS, besides increasing reliability of the devices, is the first step in the digital transformation of the management of these devices in healthcare institutions opening possibility for use of artificial intelligence.", "Rapid urbanization across the world has led to an exponential increase in demand for utilities, electricity, gas and water. The building infrastructure sector is one of the largest global consumers of electricity and thereby one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing building energy consumption directly contributes to achieving energy sustainability, emissions reduction, and addressing the challenges of a warming planet, while also supporting the rapid urbanization of human society. Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) that are digitalized using advanced sensor technologies are a formal approach that is widely adopted to reduce the energy consumption of building infrastructure. Measurement and Verification (M&V) protocols are a repeatable and transparent methodology to evaluate and formally report on energy savings. As savings cannot be directly measured, they are determined by comparing pre-retrofit and post-retrofit usage of an ECM initiative. Given the computational nature of M&V, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can be leveraged to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of M&V protocols. However, AI has been limited to a singular performance metric based on default parameters in recent M&V research. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a comprehensive AI approach for M&V protocols in energy-efficient infrastructure. The novelty of the framework lies in its use of all relevant data (pre and post-ECM) to build robust and explainable predictive AI models for energy savings estimation. The framework was implemented and evaluated in a multi-campus tertiary education institution setting, comprising 200 buildings of diverse sensor technologies and operational functions. The results of this empirical evaluation confirm the validity and contribution of the proposed framework for robust and explainable M&V for energy-efficient building infrastructure and net zero carbon emissions.", "Disorders of swallowing often lead to pneumonia when material enters the airways (aspiration). Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) plays a key role in the diagnostics of aspiration but is prone to human errors. An AI-based tool could facilitate this process. Recent non-endoscopic/non-radiologic attempts to detect aspiration using machine-learning approaches have led to unsatisfying accuracy and show black-box characteristics. Hence, for clinical users it is difficult to trust in these model decisions. Our aim is to introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to detect aspiration in FEES. Our approach is to teach the AI about the relevant anatomical structures, such as the vocal cords and the glottis, based on 92 annotated FEES videos. Simultaneously, it is trained to detect boluses that pass the glottis and become aspirated. During testing, the AI successfully recognized the glottis and the vocal cords but could not yet achieve satisfying aspiration detection quality. While detection performance must be optimized, our architecture results in a final model that explains its assessment by locating meaningful frames with relevant aspiration events and by highlighting suspected boluses. In contrast to comparable AI tools, our framework is verifiable and interpretable and, therefore, accountable for clinical users.", "The global population is aging due to many factors, including longer life expectancy through better healthcare, changing diet, physical activity, etc. We are also witnessing various frequent epidemics as well as pandemics. The existing healthcare system has failed to deliver the care and support needed to our older adults (seniors) during these frequent outbreaks. Sophisticated sensor-based in-home care systems may offer an effective solution to this global crisis. The monitoring system is the key component of any in-home care system. The evidence indicates that they are more useful when implemented in a non-intrusive manner through different visual and audio sensors. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) techniques may be ideal for this purpose. Since the RGB imagery-based CV technique may compromise privacy, people often hesitate to utilize in-home care systems which use this technology. Depth, thermal, and audio-based CV techniques could be meaningful substitutes here. Due to the need to monitor larger areas, this review article presents a systematic discussion on the state-of-the-art using depth sensors as primary data-capturing techniques. We mainly focused on fall detection and other health-related physical patterns. As gait parameters may help to detect these activities, we also considered depth sensor-based gait parameters separately. The article provides discussions on the topic in relation to the terminology, reviews, a survey of popular datasets, and future scopes.", "Neuropsychological assessment needs a more profound grounding in psychometric theory. Specifically, psychometrically reliable and valid tools are required, both in patient care and in scientific research. The present study examined convergent and discriminant validity of some of the most popular indicators of executive functioning (EF). A sample of 96 neurological inpatients (aged 18-68 years) completed a battery of standardized cognitive tests (Raven's matrices, vocabulary test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, verbal fluency test, figural fluency test). Convergent validity of indicators of intelligence (Raven's matrices, vocabulary test) and of indicators of EF (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, verbal fluency test, figural fluency) were calculated. Discriminant validity of indicators of EF against indicators of intelligence was also calculated. Convergent validity of indicators of intelligence (Raven's matrices, vocabulary test) was good (rxtyt = 0.727; R2 = 0.53). Convergent validity of fluency indicators of EF against executive cognition as indicated by performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was poor (0.087 \u2264 rxtyt \u2264 0.304; 0.008 \u2264 R2 \u2264 0.092). Discriminant validity of indicators of EF against indicators of intelligence was good (0.106 \u2264 rxtyt \u2264 0.548; 0.011 \u2264 R2 \u2264 0.300). Our conclusions from these data are clear-cut: apparently dissimilar indicators of intelligence converge on general intellectual ability. Apparently dissimilar indicators of EF (mental fluency, executive cognition) do not converge on general executive ability. Executive abilities, although non-unitary, can be reasonably well distinguished from intellectual ability. The present data contribute to the hitherto meager evidence base regarding the validity of popular indicators of EF.", "Water scarcity due to contamination of water resources with different inorganic and organic contaminants is one of the foremost global concerns. It is due to rapid industrialization, fast urbanization, and the low efficiency of traditional wastewater treatment strategies. Conventional water treatment strategies, including chemical precipitation, membrane filtration, coagulation, ion exchange, solvent extraction, adsorption, and photolysis, are based on adopting various nanomaterials (NMs) with a high surface area, including carbon NMs, polymers, metals-based, and metal oxides. However, significant bottlenecks are toxicity, cost, secondary contamination, size and space constraints, energy efficiency, prolonged time consumption, output efficiency, and scalability. On the contrary, green NMs fabricated using microorganisms emerge as cost-effective, eco-friendly, sustainable, safe, and efficient substitutes for these traditional strategies. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art microbial-assisted green NMs and strategies including microbial cells, magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), bio-augmentation and integrated bioreactors for removing an extensive range of water contaminants addressing the challenges associated with traditional strategies. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the efficacies of microbe-assisted green NM-based water remediation strategy with the traditional practices in light of crucial factors like reusability, regeneration, removal efficiency, and adsorption capacity has been presented. The associated challenges, their alternate solutions, and the cutting-edge prospects of microbial-assisted green nanobiotechnology with the integration of advanced tools including internet-of-nano-things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence have been discussed. This review opens a new window to assist future research dedicated to sustainable and green nanobiotechnology-based strategies for environmental remediation applications.", "There is a large proliferation of complex data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) applications in many aspects of our daily lives, but their implementation in healthcare is still limited. This scoping review takes a theoretical approach to examine the barriers and facilitators based on empirical data from existing implementations. We searched the major databases of relevant scientific publications for articles related to AI in clinical settings, published between 2015 and 2021. Based on the theoretical constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we used a deductive, followed by an inductive, approach to extract facilitators and barriers. After screening 2784 studies, 19 studies were included in this review. Most of the cited facilitators were related to engagement with and management of the implementation process, while the most cited barriers dealt with the intervention's generalizability and interoperability with existing systems, as well as the inner settings' data quality and availability. We noted per-study imbalances related to the reporting of the theoretic domains. Our findings suggest a greater need for implementation science expertise in AI implementation projects, to improve both the implementation process and the quality of scientific reporting.", "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly prevalent worldwide and becoming a major cause of liver disease-related morbidity and mortality. The presence of liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD is closely related to prognosis, including the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and other complications of cirrhosis. Therefore, assessment of the presence of significant or advanced liver fibrosis is crucial. Although liver biopsy has been considered the \"gold standard\" method for evaluating the degree of liver fibrosis, it is not suitable for extensive use in all patients with NAFLD owing to its invasiveness and high cost. Therefore, noninvasive biochemical and imaging biomarkers have been developed to overcome the limitations of liver biopsy. Imaging biomarkers for the stratification of liver fibrosis have been evaluated in patients with NAFLD using different imaging techniques, such as transient elastography, shear wave elastography, and magnetic resonance elastography. Furthermore, artificial intelligence and deep learning methods are increasingly being applied to improve the diagnostic accuracy of imaging techniques and overcome the pitfalls of existing imaging biomarkers. In this review, we describe the usefulness and future prospects of noninvasive imaging biomarkers that have been studied and used to evaluate the degree of liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.", "Immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoint proteins, such as programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), has shown impressive outcomes in many clinical trials but only 20%-40% of patients benefit from it. Utilizing Combined Positive Score (CPS) to evaluate PD-L1 expression in tumour biopsies to identify patients with the highest likelihood of responsiveness to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for several solid tumour types. Current CPS workflow requires a pathologist to manually score the two-colour PD-L1 chromogenic immunohistochemistry image. Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging reveals the expression of an increased number of immune markers in tumour biopsies and has been used extensively in immunotherapy research. Recent rapid progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based imaging analysis, particularly Deep Learning, provides cost effective and high-quality solutions to healthcare. In this article, we propose an imaging pipeline that utilizes three-colour mIF images (DAPI, PD-L1, and Pan-cytokeratin) as input and predicts the CPS using AI techniques. Our novel pipeline is composed of three modules employing algorithms of image processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. The first module of quality check (QC) detects and removes the image regions contaminated with sectioning and staining artefacts. The QC module ensures that only image regions free of the three common artefacts are used for downstream analysis. The second module of nuclear segmentation uses deep learning to segment and count nuclei in the DAPI images wherein our specialized method can accurately separate touching nuclei. The third module of cell phenotyping calculates CPS by identifying and counting PD-L1 positive cells and tumour cells. These modules are data-efficient and require only few manual annotations for training purposes. Using tumour biopsies from a clinical trial, we found that the CPS from the AI-based models shows a high Spearman correlation (78%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) to the pathologist-scored CPS.", "Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) can detect more cancers than the current standard breast screening method, digital mammography (DM); however, it can substantially increase the reading workload and thus hinder implementation in screening. Artificial intelligence (AI) might be a solution. The aim of this study was to retrospectively test different ways of using AI in a screening workflow.\nAn AI system was used to analyse 14,772 double-read single-view DBT examinations from a screening trial with paired DM double reading. Three scenarios were studied: if AI can identify normal cases that can be excluded from human reading; if AI can replace the second reader; if AI can replace both readers. The number of detected cancers and false positives was compared with DM or DBT double reading.\nBy excluding normal cases and only reading 50.5% (7460/14,772) of all examinations, 95% (121/127) of the DBT double reading detected cancers could be detected. Compared to DM screening, 27% (26/95) more cancers could be detected (p < 0.001) while keeping recall rates at the same level. With AI replacing the second reader, 95% (120/127) of the DBT double reading detected cancers could be detected-26% (25/95) more than DM screening (p < 0.001)-while increasing recall rates by 53%. AI alone with DBT has a sensitivity similar to DM double reading (p = 0.689).\nAI can open up possibilities for implementing DBT screening and detecting more cancers with the total reading workload unchanged. Considering the potential legal and psychological implications, replacing the second reader with AI would probably be most the feasible approach.\n\u2022 Breast cancer screening with digital breast tomosynthesis and artificial intelligence can detect more cancers than mammography screening without increasing screen-reading workload. \u2022 Artificial intelligence can either exclude low-risk cases from double reading or replace the second reader. \u2022 Retrospective study based on paired mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis screening data.", "Industry 4.0 concept has become a worldwide revolution that has been mainly led by the manufacturing sector. Continuous Process Industry is part of this global trend where there are aspects of the \"fourth industrial revolution\" that must be adapted to the particular context and needs of big continuous processes such as oil refineries that have evolved to control paradigms supported by sector-specific technologies where big volumes of operation-driven data are continuously captured from a plethora of sensors. The introduction of Artificial Intelligence techniques can overcome the current limitations of Advanced Control Systems (mainly MPCs) by providing better performance on highly non-linear and complex systems and by operating with a broader scope in terms of signals/data and sub-systems. Moreover, the state of the art of traditional PID/MPC based solutions is showing an asymptotic improvement that requires a disruptive approach in order to reach relevant improvements in terms of efficiency, optimization, maintenance, etc. This paper shows the key aspects in oil refineries to successfully adopt Big Data and Machine Learning solutions that can significantly improve the efficiency and competitiveness of continuous processes.", "Increased survival (due to the use of targeted therapies based on genomic profiling) has resulted in the increased incidence of brain metastasis during the course of disease, and thus, made it essential to have proper imaging guidelines in place for brain metastasis from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Brain parenchymal metastases can have varied imaging appearances, and it is pertinent to be aware of the various molecular risk factors for brain metastasis from NSCLC along with their suggestive imaging appearances, so as to identify them early. Leptomeningeal metastasis requires additional imaging of the spine and an early cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Differentiation of post-therapy change from recurrence on imaging has a bearing on the management, hence the need for its awareness. This article will provide in-depth literature review of the epidemiology, aetiopathogenesis, screening, detection, diagnosis, post-therapy imaging, and implications regarding the management of brain metastasis from NSCLC. In addition, we will also briefly highlight the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in brain metastasis screening.", "With the emergence of advanced technology, such as robotics, three-dimensional (3D) imaging is necessary to execute preoperative surgical plans accurately. However, 3D imaging adds cost and potential risk to patients. This study determined the measurement accuracy, reliability, and repeatability of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm which converts two-dimensional (2D) radiographs to 3D bone models.\nAn AI algorithm was developed to convert 2D radiographs to 3D bone model reconstructions. The accuracy of the AI algorithm was evaluated by comparing mean absolute error in measurements performed on 3D bone reconstructions, 3D computed tomography (CT) scans, and manual measurements on five cadaveric knees. Reliability and repeatability of the AI algorithm were evaluated by assessing the inter-observer and intra-observer agreement between measurements performed on 3D bone reconstructions, respectively.\nAccuracy of the AI algorithm was considered excellent with mean absolute errors <2mm in 9 of 12 anatomical parameters compared with measurements performed on CTs and manual calipers. All inter-observer and intra-observer correlation coefficients were greater than 0.90 representing a high level of measurement reliability and repeatability by independent observers and the same observers.\nThis particular AI algorithm demonstrated a high degree of accuracy, reliability, and repeatability for converting 2D radiographs to 3D bone reconstructions similar to a CT-scan. Study results suggest this AI algorithm has the potential for use in preoperative surgical planning due to its efficiencies related to cost and time and reduced radiation exposure without the use of 3D imaging.", "Understanding the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) has long been an area of interest in urban and environmental study fields. To examine this, existing studies have utilized both white-box and black-box approaches, including regression, decision tree, and artificial intelligence models. To overcome the limitations of previous models, this study adopted the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach in examining the relationships between LULC and LST. By integrating the XGBoost and SHAP model, we developed the LST prediction model in Seoul and estimated the LST reduction effects after specific LULC changes. Results showed that the prediction accuracy of LST was maximized when landscape, topographic, and LULC features within a 150 m buffer radius were adopted as independent variables. Specifically, the existence of surrounding built-up and vegetation areas were found to be the most influencing factors in explaining LST. In this study, after the LULC changes from expressway to green areas, approximately 1.5 \u00b0C of decreasing LST was predicted. The findings of our study can be utilized for assessing and monitoring the thermal environmental impact of urban planning and projects. Also, this study can contribute to determining the priorities of different policy measures for improving the thermal environment.", "The advent of Industry 4.0 has revolutionized the life enormously. There is a growing trend towards the Internet of Things (IoT), which has made life easier on the one hand and improved services on the other. However, it also has vulnerabilities due to cyber security attacks. Therefore, there is a need for intelligent and reliable security systems that can proactively analyze the data generated by these devices and detect cybersecurity attacks. This study proposed a proactive interpretable prediction model using ML and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to detect different types of security attacks using the log data generated by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) attacks. Several ML algorithms were used, such as Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Ada Boost (AB), Light Gradient Boosting (LGBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and CatBoost (CB). Furthermore, feature selection was performed using stepwise forward feature selection (FFS) technique. To alleviate the data imbalance, SMOTE and Tomeklink were used. In addition, SMOTE achieved the best results with selected features. Empirical experiments were conducted, and the results showed that the XGBoost classifier has produced the best result with 0.9999 Area Under the Curve (AUC), 0.9998, accuracy (ACC), 0.9996 Recall, 1.000 Precision and 0.9998 F1 Score got the best result. Additionally, XAI was applied to the best performing model to add the interpretability in the black-box model. Local and global explanations were generated using LIME and SHAP. The results of the proposed study have confirmed the effectiveness of ML for predicting the cyber security attacks on IoT devices and Industry 4.0.", "Histopathology is the gold standard for disease diagnosis. The use of digital histology on fresh samples can reduce processing time and potential image artifacts, as label-free samples do not need to be fixed nor stained. This fact allows for a faster diagnosis, increasing the speed of the process and the impact on patient prognosis. This work proposes, implements, and validates a novel digital diagnosis procedure of fresh label-free histological samples. The procedure is based on advanced phase-imaging microscopy parameters and artificial intelligence. Fresh human histological samples of healthy and tumoral liver, kidney, ganglion, testicle and brain were collected and imaged with phase-imaging microscopy. Advanced phase parameters were calculated from the images. The statistical significance of each parameter for each tissue type was evaluated at different magnifications of 10\u00d7, 20\u00d7 and 40\u00d7. Several classification algorithms based on artificial intelligence were applied and evaluated. Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree approaches provided the best general sensibility and specificity results, with values over 90% for the majority of biological tissues at some magnifications. These results show the potential to provide a label-free automatic significant diagnosis of fresh histological samples with advanced parameters of phase-imaging microscopy. This approach can complement the present clinical procedures.", "To assess the performance of prospectively accelerated and deep learning (DL) reconstructed T2-weighted (T2w) imaging in volunteers and patients with histologically proven prostate cancer (PCa).\nProspectively undersampled T2w datasets were acquired with acceleration factors of 1.7 (reference), 3.4 and 4.8 in 10 healthy volunteers and 23 patients with histologically proven PCa. Image reconstructions using compressed SENSE (C-SENSE) and a combination of C-SENSE and DL-based artificial intelligence (C-SENSE AI) were analyzed. Qualitative image comparison was performed using a 6-point Likert scale (overall image quality, noise, motion artifacts, lesion detection, diagnostic certainty); the T2 and PI-RADS scores were compared between the two reconstructions. Additionally, quantitative image parameters were assessed (apparent SNR, apparent CNR, lesion size, line profiles).\nAll C-SENSE AI-reconstructed images received a significantly higher qualitative rating compared to the C-SENSE standard images. Analysis of the quantitative parameters supported this finding, with significantly higher aSNR and aCNR. The line profiles demonstrated a significantly steeper signal change at the border of the prostatic lesion and the adjacent normal tissue in the C-SENSE AI-reconstructed images, whereas the T2 and PI-RADS scores as well as the lesion size did not differ.\nIn this prospective study, we demonstrated the clinical feasibility of a novel C-SENSE AI reconstruction enabling a 58% acceleration in T2w imaging of the prostate while obtaining significantly better image quality.", "Due to the interaction between floating weak targets and sea clutter in complex marine environments, it is necessary to distinguish targets and sea clutter from different dimensions by designing universal deep learning models. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the concept of multimodal data fusion from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) to the marine target detection task. Using deep learning methods, a target detection network model based on the multimodal data fusion of radar echoes is proposed. In the paper, according to the characteristics of different modalities data, the temporal LeNet (T-LeNet) network module and time-frequency feature extraction network module are constructed to extract the time domain features, frequency domain features, and time-frequency features from radar sea surface echo signals. To avoid the impact of redundant features between different modalities data on detection performance, a Self-Attention mechanism is introduced to fuse and optimize the features of different dimensions. The experimental results based on the publicly available IPIX radar and CSIR datasets show that the multimodal data fusion of radar echoes can effectively improve the detection performance of marine floating weak targets. The proposed model has a target detection probability of 0.97 when the false alarm probability is 10-3 under the lower signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) sea state. Compared with the feature-based detector and the detection model based on single-modality data, the new model proposed by us has stronger detection performance and universality under various marine detection environments. Moreover, the transfer learning method is used to train the new model in this paper, which effectively reduces the model training time. This provides the possibility of applying deep learning methods to real-time target detection at sea.", "Cryptocurrency, often known as virtual or digital currency, is a safe platform and a key component of the blockchain that has recently attracted much interest. Utilizing blockchain technology, bitcoin transactions are recorded in blocks that provide detailed information on all financial transactions. Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant applicability in several industries because of the abundance and processing capacity of large data. One of the main issues is the absence of explanations for AI algorithms in the current decision-making standards. For instance, there is no deep-learning-based reasoning or control for the system's input or output processes. More particularly, the bias for adversarial attacks on the process interface and learning characterizes existing AI systems. This study suggests an AI-based trustworthy architecture that uses decentralized blockchain characteristics such as smart contracts and trust oracles. The decentralized consensuses of AI predictors are also decided by this system using AI, enabling secure cryptocurrency transactions, and utilizing the blockchain technology and transactional network analysis. By utilizing AI for a thorough examination of a network, this system's primary objective is to improve the performance of the bitcoin network in terms of transactions and security. In comparison to other state-of-the-art systems, the results demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve very accurate output.", "As artificial intelligence technology advances, it is necessary to imitate various biological functions to complete more complex tasks. Among them, studies have been reported on the nociceptor, a critical receptor of sensory neurons that can detect harmful stimuli. Although a complex CMOS circuit is required to electrically realize a nociceptor, a memristor with threshold switching characteristics can implement the nociceptor as a single device. Here, we suggest a memristor with a Pt/HfO2/TaOx/TaN bilayer structure. This device can mimic the characteristics of a nociceptor including the threshold, relaxation, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. Additionally, we contrast different electrical properties according to the thickness of the HfO2 layer. Moreover, Pt/HfO2/TaOx/TaN with a 3 nm thick HfO2 layer has a stable endurance of 1000 cycles and controllable threshold switching characteristics. Finally, this study emphasizes the importance of the material selection and fabrication method in the memristor by comparing Pt/HfO2/TaOx/TaN with Pt/TaOx/TaN, which has insufficient performance to be used as a nociceptor.", "Honey adulteration is a common practice that affects food quality and sale prices, and certifying the origin of the honey using non-destructive methods is critical. Guindo Santo and Quillay are fundamental for the honey production of Biob\u00edo and the \u00d1uble region in Chile. Furthermore, Guindo Santo only exists in this area of the world. Therefore, certifying honey of this species is crucial for beekeeper communities-mostly natives-to give them advantages and competitiveness in the global market. To solve this necessity, we present a system for detecting adulterated endemic honey that combines different artificial intelligence networks with a confocal optical microscope and a tunable optical filter for hyperspectral data acquisition. Honey samples artificially adulterated with syrups at concentrations undetectable to the naked eye were used for validating different artificial intelligence models. Comparing Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Support vector machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN), we reach the best average accuracy value with SVM of 93% for all classes in both kinds of honey. We hope these results will be the starting point of a method for honey certification in Chile in an automated way and with high precision.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in physical therapy diagnosis and management for various impairments. Physical therapists (PTs) need to be able to utilize the latest innovative treatment techniques to improve the quality of care. The study aimed to describe PTs' views on AI and investigate multiple factors as indicators of AI knowledge, attitude, and adoption among PTs. Moreover, the study aimed to identify the barriers to using AI in rehabilitation. Two hundred and thirty-six PTs participated voluntarily in the study. A concurrent mixed-method design was used to document PTs' opinions regarding AI deployment in rehabilitation. A self-administered survey consisting of several aspects, including demographic, knowledge, uses, advantages, impacts, and barriers limiting AI utilization in rehabilitation, was used. A total of 63.3% of PTs reported that they had not experienced any kind of AI applications at work. The major factors predicting a higher level of AI knowledge among PTs were being a non-academic worker (OR = 1.77 [95% CI; 1.01 to 3.12], p = 0.04), being a senior PT (OR = 2.44, [95%CI: 1.40 to 4.22], p = 0.002), and having a Master/Doctorate degree (OR = 1.97, [95%CI: 1.11 to 3.50], p = 0.02). However, the cost and resources of AI were the major reported barriers to adopting AI-based technologies. The study highlighted a remarkable dearth of AI knowledge among PTs. AI and advanced knowledge in technology need to be urgently transferred to PTs.", "Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are pollutants of worldwide concern that seriously threaten public health and ecosystems. Machine learning (ML) prediction models have been applied to predict ARGs in beach waters. However, the existing studies were conducted at a single location and had low prediction performance. Moreover, ML models are \"black boxes\" that do not reveal their predictions' internal nuances and mechanisms. This lack of transparency and trust can result in serious consequences when using these models in high-stakes decisions. In this study, we developed a gradient boosted regression tree based (GBRT) ML model and then described its behavior using six explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model-agnostic explanation methods. We used hydro-meteorological and qPCR data from the beaches in South Korea and Pakistan and developed ML prediction models for aac (6'-lb-cr), sul1, and tetX with 10-fold time-blocked cross-validation performances of 4.9, 2.06 and 4.4 root mean squared logarithmic error, respectively. We then analyzed the local and global behavior of the developed ML model using four interpretation methods. The developed ML models showed that water temperature, precipitation and tide are the most important predictors for prediction of ARGs at recreational beaches. We show that the model-agnostic interpretation methods not only explain the behavior of the ML model but also provide insights into the behavior of the ML model under new unseen conditions. Moreover, these post-processing techniques can be a debugging tool for ML-based modeling.", "Nutritional epidemiological studies show a triple burden of malnutrition with disparate prevalence across the coexisting ethnicities in Malaysia. To tackle malnutrition and related conditions in Malaysia, research in the new and evolving field of nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics is essential. As part of the Gene-Nutrient Interactions (GeNuIne) Collaboration, the Nutrigenetics and Nutrigenomics Research and Training Unit (N2RTU) aims to solve the malnutrition paradox. This review discusses and presents a conceptual framework that shows the pathway to implementing and strengthening precision nutrition strategies in Malaysia. The framework is divided into: (1) Research and (2) Training and Resource Development. The first arm collects data from genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, gut microbiome, and phenotypic and lifestyle factors to conduct nutrigenetic, nutrigenomic, and nutri-epigenetic studies. The second arm is focused on training and resource development to improve the capacity of the stakeholders (academia, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the food industry) to utilise the findings generated by research in their respective fields. Finally, the N2RTU framework foresees its applications in artificial intelligence and the implementation of precision nutrition through the action of stakeholders.", "A sustainable environment by decreasing fossil fuel utilization and anthropogenic greenhouse gases is a globally main goal due to climate change and serious air pollution. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a heat-trapping (greenhouse) that is released into the earth's atmosphere from natural processes, such as volcanic respiration and eruptions, as well as human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Due to this fact, underground carbon storage (UCS) is a promising technology to cut carbon emissions. However, there are some barriers to prevent UCS from applying globally. One of them is evaluating the feasibility of storage projects. Thus, the prediction accuracy of CO2 storage efficiencies may promote the attention of the community for UCS. In this study, we utilize the recent advances of swarm intelligence to develop a hybrid algorithm called AOSMA, employed to train the long short-term memory (LSTM). The developed swarm intelligence method (AOSMA) is an enhanced Aquila optimizer (AO) using the search mechanism of the slime mould algorithm (SMA). It is used to boost the prediction capability of the LSTM by optimizing its parameters. We considered two CO2 trapping indices, called residual trapping index (RTI) and solubility trapping index (STI). The evaluation experiments have shown that the AOSMA achieved significant results compared to the original AO and SMA and several swarm intelligence and optimization algorithms. The developed smart tools could use as a game changer to provide fast and accurate storage efficiency for projects that have similar parameters falling within the range of the database.", "In order to improve product format quality and material flexibility, variety of application, and cost-effectiveness, SiC, ZrO2, and Al hybrid composites were manufactured in the research utilizing the powder metallurgy (PM) technique. A model was created to predict the tribological behavior of SiC-ZrO2-Al hybrid composites using statistical data analysis and gene expression programming (GEP) based on artificial intelligence. For the purpose of examining the impact of zirconia concentration, sliding distance, and applied stress on the wear behavior of hybrid composites, a comprehensive factor design of experiments was used. The developed GEP model was sufficiently robust to achieve extremely high accuracy in the prediction of the determine coefficient (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the root relative square error (RRSE). The maximum state of the RMSE was 0.4357 for the GEP-1 (w1) model and the lowest state was 0.7591 for the GEP-4 (w1) model, while the maximum state of the RRSE was 0.4357 for the GEP-1 (w1) model and the minimum state was 0.3115 for the GEP-3 model (w1).", "Today, artificial intelligence plays a huge role in the mechanical engineering field for solving many complex problems and the problem with fracture mechanics is one of them. In fracture mechanics, artificial intelligence is used to predict crack behavior under various conditions such as mixed-mode loading. Many parameters are used for explaining the crack behavior under various conditions, but those parameters are obtained from destructive testing, in which usually, only one data point is obtained from each test. An artificial problem method requires a large amount of data to train the model to be able to learn crack behavior, which is a disadvantage of applying this method to fracture mechanics. To eliminate the disadvantage of the large amount of experiment data required for modeling, in this study, the small data obtained from the experiment along with data obtained from fracture criteria that were used for elementary prediction of mixed mode fracture toughness were used to create an artificial intelligence model. Data from the experiment was combined with fracture criteria data using the multi-fidelity surrogate model that is described in this study. The mixed mode I/II fracture toughness of the PMMA material was tested in order to primarily propose the data combination technique. After the modeling process, the prediction results indicated that the performance of a model in which the actual test data was combined with the data from the fracture criteria (multi-fidelity surrogate model) was more predictively effective compared to only actual data-based modeling.", "The body of scientific literature continues to grow annually. Over 1.5 million abstracts of biomedical publications were added to the PubMed database in 2021. Therefore, developing cognitive systems that provide a specialized search for information in scientific publications based on subject area ontology and modern artificial intelligence methods is urgently needed. We previously developed a web-based information retrieval system, ANDDigest, designed to search and analyze information in the PubMed database using a customized domain ontology. This paper presents an improved ANDDigest version that uses fine-tuned PubMedBERT classifiers to enhance the quality of short name recognition for molecular-genetics entities in PubMed abstracts on eight biological object types: cell components, diseases, side effects, genes, proteins, pathways, drugs, and metabolites. This approach increased average short name recognition accuracy by 13%.", "Detecting breast cancer (BC) at the initial stages of progression has always been regarded as a lifesaving intervention. With modern technology, extensive studies have unraveled the complexity of BC, but the current standard practice of early breast cancer screening and clinical management of cancer progression is still heavily dependent on tissue biopsies, which are invasive and limited in capturing definitive cancer signatures for more comprehensive applications to improve outcomes in BC care and treatments. In recent years, reviews and studies have shown that liquid biopsies in the form of blood, containing free circulating and exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs), have become increasingly evident as a potential minimally invasive alternative to tissue biopsy or as a complement to biomarkers in assessing and classifying BC. As such, in this review, the potential of miRNAs as the key BC signatures in liquid biopsy are addressed, including the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning platforms (ML), in capitalizing on the big data of miRNA for a more comprehensive assessment of the cancer, leading to practical clinical utility in BC management.", "The music-based attention assessment (MAA) is a melody contour identification task that evaluates different types of attention. Previous studies have examined the psychometric and physiological validity of the MAA across various age groups in clinical and typical populations. The purpose of this study was to confirm the MAA's criterion validity in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to correlate this with standardized neuropsychological measurements. The MAA and various neurocognitive tests (i.e., the Wechsler adult intelligence scale DST, Delis-Kaplan executive functioning scale color-word interference test, and Conner's continuous performance test) were administered to 38 patients within two weeks prior to or post to the MAA administration. Significant correlations between MAA and neurocognitive batteries were found, indicating the potential of MAA as a valid measure of different types of attention deficits. An additional multiple regression analysis revealed that MAA was a significant factor in predicting attention ability.", "Intra-operative 3D X-rays have been confirmed to decrease revision rates and improve optimal screw placement in complex fractures of the distal radius. Compared with traditional surgical publications, another advantage of whole intraoperative clinical imaging can be presented in electronic databases, e.g., the ICUC working group, through a link without size limitation. The detail of complete intra-operative image dataset includes essential technical details which can be analyzed secondarily for costs and complications, considering the technical performance bias. Furthermore, the new format complies with reading/learning preferences of young surgeons and allows secondary work-up by artificial intelligence. Intra-operative 3D X-ray is a new approach for better surgical outcomes, economic benefit, and educational purposes.", "This study surveyed the views of breast screening readers in the UK on how to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology into breast screening mammography.\nAn online questionnaire was circulated to the UK breast screening readers. Questions included their degree of approval of four AI implementation scenarios: AI as triage, AI as a companion reader/reader aid, AI replacing one of the initial two readers, and AI replacing all readers. They were also asked to rank five AI representation options (discrete opinion; mammographic scoring; percentage score with 100% indicating malignancy; region of suspicion; heat map) and indicate which evidence they considered necessary to support the implementation of AI into their practice among six options offered.\nThe survey had 87 nationally accredited respondents across the UK; 73 completed the survey in full. Respondents approved of AI replacing one of the initial two human readers and objected to AI replacing all human readers. Participants were divided on AI as triage and AI as a reader companion. A region of suspicion superimposed on the image was the preferred AI representation option. Most screen readers considered national guidelines (77%), studies using a nationally representative dataset (65%) and independent prospective studies (60%) as essential evidence. Participants' free-text comments highlighted concerns and the need for additional validation.\nOverall, screen readers supported the introduction of AI as a partial replacement of human readers and preferred a graphical indication of the suspected tumour area, with further evidence and national guidelines considered crucial prior to implementation.", "To compile a list of instant diagnoses of major fetal anomalies, and to present their sonographic descriptors and test them in a retrospective series of fetuses with congenital anomalies managed at our center.\nThe first step was to identify major anomalies that meet the following criteria: (1) can be diagnosed directly and unequivocally on the basis of a set of descriptors evident on a single sonographic view; (2) are among those more commonly diagnosed in utero; (3) represent major lethal or life-threatening malformations or anomalies for which no or only palliative surgery can be performed. For each of these anomalies, a sonographic descriptor was produced. The second step was to test the descriptors of the instant diagnoses in all cases with these anomalies evaluated since January 2000 in our Fetal Medicine Unit, retrieved from our electronic database. For each congenital anomaly-sonographic descriptor pair we then evaluated the presence vs absence of an unequivocal relationship between anomaly and descriptor, assessing: whether a particular descriptor in a set reference plane identified unequivocally the anomaly, i.e. the same descriptor could not be found in any other malformation; and whether a particular anomaly presented the corresponding descriptor in all cases. Finally, we evaluated whether the sonographic descriptors could be applied in all trimesters or only selectively, considering the natural history of the 20 instant diagnoses.\nOf the 20 instant diagnoses, five involved the central/peripheral nervous system (exencephaly/anencephaly, alobar/semilobar holoprosencephaly, cephalocele, open spinal dysraphism, complete agenesis of corpus callosum), five involved the heart (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, complete atrioventricular septal defect, severe Ebstein's anomaly, critical aortic stenosis, transposition of the great arteries), five involved the abdominal wall (left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia, exomphalos, gastroschisis, body-stalk anomaly) or gastrointestinal tract (duodenal atresia), and five involved the remaining systems (three urinary (autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, multicystic dysplastic kidney, lower urinary tract obstruction), two skeletal (transverse limb defect, radial ray defect)). All of the descriptors were found to identify unequivocally the related malformations, whereas four of the malformations were not associated with their reference descriptors in every case. For example, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (left-sided) presented without the stomach in the thorax in 42/93 (45.2%) cases. Due to the natural history of the condition, not all signs were recognizable in the first trimester, some becoming evident only from the second trimester onwards.\nWe have defined sonographic descriptors that enable an unequivocal instant diagnosis for a list of 20 major congenital anomalies: the 'INDIAMAN-20' (INstant DIAgnosis of Major ANomalies) protocol. We believe that using this approach may facilitate focused training of less experienced operators and that it may be incorporated into artificial intelligence and deep learning protocols, further boosting the instant prenatal recognition of these lethal or life-threatening malformations. \u00a9 2022 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.", "Driven by the information technology revolution, using artificial intelligence to promote intelligent manufacturing while achieving carbon emissions reduction is increasingly the focus of international attention. Given this, based on the fact that China's industrial manufacturing is more intelligent, this paper uses industrial sector data and robot data from 2000 to 2017 to examine the impact of intelligent manufacturing on industrial carbon dioxide emissions and to discuss its internal mechanism. The research found that intelligent manufacturing significantly inhibits carbon dioxide emissions in the industrial sectors. The emission reduction effect is more obvious in industries with higher carbon emissions and intelligence. The mechanism test shows that intelligent manufacturing mainly achieves industrial emission reduction by reducing fossil energy consumption in the production process and improving energy use efficiency. The research findings of this paper provide favorable evidence for using new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to achieve carbon emissions reduction, and validate the importance of intelligent manufacturing in tackling climate change in the future. It provides an essential reference for developing countries to use artificial intelligence for their carbon emissions reduction goals.", "Long-term survivors of pediatric hematologic malignancies are at elevated risk for neurocognitive impairment. Such impairment manifests in different ways at different times during survivorship, with deficits in processing speed, attention, and memory often appearing before deficits in executive function, intelligence, and academics. Survivors exposed to therapies that directly target the central nervous system (CNS), as is the case in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, may demonstrate subtle deficits during frontline therapy, and these deficits may grow and evolve over time. Survivors who do not receive CNS-directed therapies (eg, Hodgkin lymphoma) are also at elevated risk for neurocognitive impairment, although the influence on brain function is indirect through cancer therapy impact on systemic organ function vital to brain health (eg, cardiopulmonary morbidity). Over the course of the survivor's life span, the presence and impact of neurocognitive deficits will be determined by a complex interaction between premorbid development and environment, cancer therapy and clinical care, and posttreatment recovery and health. The timing and type of these treatment and health events will dictate the approach to screening and monitoring for neurocognitive impairment.", "Mucopolysaccharidosis type I-H (MPS I-H) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by \u03b1-L-Iduronidase deficiency. Early haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the sole available therapeutic option to preserve neurocognitive functions. We report long-term follow-up (median 9 years, interquartile range 8-16.5) for 51 MPS I-H patients who underwent HSCT between 1986 and 2018 in France. 4 patients died from complications of HSCT and one from disease progression. Complete chimerism and normal \u03b1-L-Iduronidase activity were obtained in 84% and 71% of patients respectively. No difference of outcomes was observed between bone marrow and cord blood stem cell sources. All patients acquired independent walking and 91% and 78% acquired intelligible language or reading and writing. Intelligence Quotient evaluation (n\u2009=\u200923) showed that 69% had IQ\u2009\u2265\u200970 at last follow-up. 58% of patients had normal or remedial schooling and 62% of the 13 adults had good socio-professional insertion. Skeletal dysplasia as well as vision and hearing impairments progressed despite HSCT, with significant disability. These results provide a long-term assessment of HSCT efficacy in MPS I-H and could be useful in the evaluation of novel promising treatments such as gene therapy.", "This is a review on the use of artificial intelligence for digital breast pathology. A systematic search on PubMed was conducted, identifying 17,324 research papers related to breast cancer pathology. Following a semimanual screening, 664 papers were retrieved and pursued. The papers are grouped into six major tasks performed by pathologists-namely, molecular and hormonal analysis, grading, mitotic figure counting, ki-67 indexing, tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte assessment, and lymph node metastases identification. Under each task, open-source datasets for research to build artificial intelligence (AI) tools are also listed. Many AI tools showed promise and demonstrated feasibility in the automation of routine pathology investigations. We expect continued growth of AI in this field as new algorithms mature.", "The current \"Gold Standard\" colorectal cancer (CRC) screening approach of faecal occult blood test (FOBT) with follow-up colonoscopy\u00a0has been shown to significantly improve morbidity and mortality, by enabling the early detection of disease. However, its efficacy is predicated on high levels of population participation in screening. Several international studies have shown\u00a0continued\u00a0low rates of screening participation, especially amongst highly vulnerable lower socio-economic cohorts, with minimal improvement using current recruitment strategies. Research suggests that a complex of dynamic factors (patient, clinician, and the broader health system) contribute to low citizen engagement. This paper\u00a0argues that the challenges of screening participation can be better addressed by (1) developing dynamic multifaceted technological interventions collaboratively across stakeholders using human-centered design; (2) integrating consumer-centred artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to maximise ease of use for CRC screening; and (3) tailored strategies that maximise population screening engagement, especially amongst the most vulnerable.", "Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is a significant source of protein and oil and is also widely used as animal feed. Thus, developing lines that are superior in terms of yield, protein, and oil content is important to feed the ever-growing population. As opposed to high-cost phenotyping, genotyping is both cost and time efficient for breeders because evaluating new lines in different environments (location-year combinations) can be costly. Several genomic prediction (GP) methods have been developed to use the marker and environment data effectively to predict the yield or other relevant phenotypic traits of crops. Our study compares a conventional GP method (genomic best linear unbiased predictor [GBLUP]), a kernel method (Gaussian kernel [GK]), an artificial-intelligence (AI) method (deep learning [DL]), and a hybrid method that corresponds to the emulation of a DL model using a kernel method (an arc-cosine kernel [AK]) in terms of their prediction accuracies for predicting grain yield, oil, and protein using data from the soybean nested association mapping experiment (1,379 genotypes tested in six environments, all genotypes in all environments). The relative performance of the four methods varied with the response variable and whether the model includes the genotype \u00d7 environmental interaction (G\u00d7E) effects or not. The GBLUP consistently showed better performances, whereas GK and AK followed a similar pattern to GBLUP and DL performed slightly worse than the other three methods in most of the cases; however, this may also be attributed to suboptimal hyperparameters. The DL method performed particularly worse than the other three methods in presence of the G\u00d7E effects.", "The ultimate goals of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) are the reduction of reading times, the increase of diagnostic performance, and the reduction of interval cancer rates. In this review, after outlining the journey from computer-aided detection/diagnosis systems to AI applied to digital mammography (DM), we summarize the results of studies where AI was applied to DBT, noting that long-term advantages of DBT screening and its crucial ability to decrease the interval cancer rate are still under scrutiny. AI has shown the capability to overcome some shortcomings of DBT in the screening setting by improving diagnostic performance and by reducing recall rates (from -2\u00a0% to -27\u00a0%) and reading times (up to -53\u00a0%, with an average 20\u00a0% reduction), but the ability of AI to reduce interval cancer rates has not yet been clearly investigated. Prospective validation is needed to assess the cost-effectiveness and real-world impact of AI models assisting DBT interpretation, especially in large-scale studies with low breast cancer prevalence. Finally, we focus on the incoming era of personalized and risk-stratified screening that will first see the application of contrast-enhanced breast imaging to screen women with extremely dense breasts. As the diagnostic advantage of DBT over DM was concentrated in this category, we try to understand if the application of AI to DM in the remaining cohorts of women with heterogeneously dense or non-dense breast could close the gap in diagnostic performance between DM and DBT, thus neutralizing the usefulness of AI application to DBT.", "In this issue of Neuron, Kagan et\u00a0al.1 implement learning-in-a-dish as an important step toward organoid intelligence. These systems may complement the study of molecular and cellular mechanisms of cognition and allow innovations in pharmacological and toxicological studies of neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders as well as advances in biological computing.", "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased in medical radiation science, with advanced computing and modelling. Considering radiation therapists (RTs) perceptions of how this may affect their role is imperative, as this will contribute to increasing the efficiency of implementation and improve service delivery.\nA peer-reviewed anonymous survey was developed and completed by 105 RTs between April and June 2021. The online survey was distributed via the Medical Radiation Practice Board of Australia and the Australian Society of Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy newsletter as well as professional networks. The survey gained perceptions of the impact of AI on radiation therapy practice and RTs roles within Australia, and data were analysed using quantitative data analysis and thematic analysis.\nAutomation is used throughout radiation therapy practice, with 68% of RTs being optimistic about this. The majority (63%) had little to no knowledge of working with AI and 96% would like to learn more including the underpinnings of AI and its safe and ethical use. Many (66%) perceived AI would affect their role, including increasing their skillset and reducing mundane tasks, whereas others (23%) perceived it would reduce job satisfaction by increasing repetition and limiting their problem-solving ability. AI was perceived to impact the patient positively (67%), increasing efficiency and accuracy of radiotherapy treatments; however, it could depersonalise patient care.\nRTs perceive embracing AI in radiotherapy has the potential to advance the profession and improve the service to patients. If AI is implemented with sufficient training for greater understanding, and management uses these benefits to improve patient care, rather than replace RTs roles, then overall any negatives will be outweighed by the benefits.", "Dry eye disease is one of the most common ophthalmological complaints and is defined by a loss of tear film homeostasis. Establishing a diagnosis can be time-consuming, resource demanding and unpleasant for the patient. In this pilot study, we retrospectively included clinical data from 431 patients with dry eye disease examined in the Norwegian Dry Eye Clinic to evaluate how artificial intelligence algorithms perform on clinical data related to dry eye disease. The data was processed and subjected to numerous machine learning classification algorithms with the aim to predict decreased tear film break-up time. Moreover, feature selection techniques (information gain and information gain ratio) were applied to determine which clinical factors contribute most to an unstable tear film. The applied machine learning algorithms outperformed baseline classifications performed with ZeroR according to included evaluation metrics. Clinical features such as ocular surface staining, meibomian gland expressibility and dropout, blink frequency, osmolarity, meibum quality and symptom score were recognized as important predictors for tear film instability. We identify and discuss potential limitations and pitfalls.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is presently employed in several medical specialties, particularly those that rely on large quantities of standardized data. The integration of AI in surgical subspecialties is under preclinical investigation but is yet to be widely implemented. Plastic surgeons collect standardized data in various settings and could benefit from AI. This systematic review investigates the current clinical applications of AI in plastic and reconstructive surgery.\nA comprehensive literature search of the Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, and PubMed databases was conducted for AI studies with multiple search terms. Articles that progressed beyond the title and abstract screening were then subcategorized based on the plastic surgery subspecialty and AI application.\nThe systematic search yielded a total of 1820 articles. Forty-four studies met inclusion criteria warranting further analysis. Subcategorization of articles by plastic surgery subspecialties revealed that most studies fell into aesthetic and breast surgery (27%), craniofacial surgery (23%), or microsurgery (14%). Analysis of the research study phase of included articles indicated that the current research is primarily in phase 0 (discovery and invention; 43.2%), phase 1 (technical performance and safety; 27.3%), or phase 2 (efficacy, quality improvement, and algorithm performance in a medical setting; 27.3%). Only one study demonstrated translation to clinical practice.\nThe potential of AI to optimize clinical efficiency is being investigated in every subfield of plastic surgery, but much of the research to date remains in the preclinical status. Future implementation of AI into everyday clinical practice will require collaborative efforts.", "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease that obstructs the bile ducts and causes liver cirrhosis and cholangiocarcinoma. Efficient surrogate markers are required to measure disease progression. The cytokeratin 7 (K7) load in a liver specimen is an independent prognostic indicator that can be measured from digitalized slides using artificial intelligence (AI)-based models.\nA K7-AI model 2.0 was built to measure the hepatocellular K7 load area of the parenchyma, portal tracts, and biliary epithelium. K7-stained PSC liver biopsy specimens (n\u00a0=\u00a0295) were analyzed. A compound endpoint (liver transplantation, liver-related death, and cholangiocarcinoma) was applied in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to measure AUC values and positive likelihood ratios for each histological variable detected by the model.\nThe K7-AI model 2.0 was a better prognostic tool than plasma alkaline phosphatase, the fibrosis stage evaluated by Nakanuma classification, or K7 score evaluated by a pathologist based on the AUC values of measured variables. A combination of parameters, such as portal tract volume and area of K7-positive hepatocytes analyzed by the model, produced an AUC of 0.81 for predicting the compound endpoint. Portal tract volume measured by the model correlated with the histological fibrosis stage.\nThe K7 staining of histological liver specimens in PSC provides significant information on disease outcomes through objective and reproducible data, including variables that cannot be measured by a human pathologist. The K7-AI model 2.0 could serve as a prognostic tool for clinical endpoints and as a surrogate marker in drug trials.", "The etio-pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can be explained using a biopsychosocial model. Little is known about obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) in the context of chromosomal disorders involving the X chromosome.\nCase studies of two patients with chromosomal disorders involving the X chromosome (Patient 1 with a variant of Turner syndrome and Patient 2 with triple X syndrome).\nBoth patients were treated due to severe OCS. In the research MRI analysis, the most pronounced MRI change in both patients was a gray matter volume loss in the orbitofrontal cortex. Patient 1 additionally showed left mesiotemporal changes. Patient 2 presented with global gray matter volume reduction, slowing in EEG, and a reduced intelligence quotient.\nOCS could occur in the context of Turner syndrome or triple X syndrome. The detected MRI changes would be compatible with dysfunction of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops involved in OCD pathophysiology. Further studies with larger patient groups should investigate whether this association can be validated.", "The diagnosis of dental implants and the periapical tissues using periapical radiographs is crucial. Recently, artificial intelligence has shown a rapid advancement in the field of radiographic imaging.\nThis study attempted to detect dental implants and peri-implant tissues by using a deep learning method known as object detection on the implant image of periapical radiographs.\nAfter implant treatment, the periapical images were collected and data were processed by labeling the dental implant and peri-implant tissue together in the images. Next, 300 images of the periapical radiographs were split into 80:20 ratio (i.e. 80% of the data were used for training the model while 20% were used for testing the model). These were evaluated using an object detection model known as Faster R-CNN, which simultaneously performs classification and localization. This model was evaluated on the classification performance using metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, in order to assess the localization performance, an evaluation through intersection over union (IoU) was utilized, and, Average Precision (AP) was used to assess both the classification and localization performance.\nConsidering the classification performance, precision\u2009=\u20090.977, recall\u2009=\u20090.992, and F1 score\u2009=\u20090.984 were derived. The indicator of localization was derived as mean IoU\u2009=\u20090.907. On the other hand, considering the indicators of both classification and localization performance, AP showed an object detection level of AP@0.5\u2009=\u20090.996 and AP@0.75\u2009=\u20090.967.\nThus, the implementation of Faster R-CNN model for object detection on 300 periapical radiographic images including dental implants, resulted in high-quality object detection for dental implants and peri-implant tissues.", "Though significant progress in disease elimination has been made over the past decades, trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness globally. Further efforts in trachoma elimination are paradoxically being limited by the relative rarity of the disease, which makes clinical training for monitoring surveys difficult. In this work, we evaluate the plausibility of an Artificial Intelligence model to augment or replace human image graders in the evaluation/diagnosis of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF).\nWe utilized a dataset consisting of 2300 images with a 5% positivity rate for TF. We developed classifiers by implementing two state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network architectures, ResNet101 and VGG16, and applying a suite of data augmentation/oversampling techniques to the positive images. We then augmented our data set with additional images from independent research groups and evaluated performance.\nModels performed well in minimizing the number of false negatives, given the constraint of the low numbers of images in which TF was present. The best performing models achieved a sensitivity of 95% and positive predictive value of 50-70% while reducing the number images requiring skilled grading by 66-75%. Basic oversampling and data augmentation techniques were most successful at improving model performance, while techniques that are grounded in clinical experience, such as highlighting follicles, were less successful.\nThe developed models perform well and significantly reduce the burden on graders by minimizing the number of false negative identifications. Further improvements in model skill will benefit from data sets with more TF as well as a range in image quality and image capture techniques used. While these models approach/meet the community-accepted standard for skilled field graders (i.e., Cohen's Kappa >0.7), they are insufficient to be deployed independently/clinically at this time; rather, they can be utilized to significantly reduce the burden on skilled image graders.", "The Ambient Intelligent Geriatric Management (AmbIGeM) system combines wearable sensors with artificial intelligence to trigger alerts to hospital staff before a fall. A clinical trial found no effect across a heterogenous population, but reported a reduction in the injurious falls rate in a post hoc analysis of patients on Geriatric Evaluation Management Unit (GEMU) wards. Cost-effectiveness and Value of Information (VoI) analyses of the AmbIGeM system in GEMU wards was undertaken.\nAn Australian health-care system perspective and 5-year time horizon were used for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Implementation costs, inpatient costs and falls data were collected. Injurious falls were defined as causing bruising, laceration, fracture, loss of consciousness, or if the patient reported persistent pain. To compare costs and outcomes, generalised linear regression models were used to adjust for baseline differences between the intervention and usual care groups. Bootstrapping was used to represent uncertainty. For the VoI analysis, 10,000 different sample sizes with randomly sampled values ranging from 1 to 50,000 were tested to estimate the optimal sample size of a new trial that maximised the Expected Net Benefits of Sampling.\nAn adjusted 0.036 fewer injurious falls (adjusted rate ratio of 0.56) and AUD$4554 lower costs were seen in the intervention group. However, uncertainty that the intervention is cost effective for the prevention of an injurious fall was present at all monetary values of this effectiveness outcome. A new trial with a sample of 4376 patients was estimated to maximise the Expected Net Benefit of Sampling, generating a net benefit of AUD$186,632 at a benefit-to-cost ratio of 1.1.\nThe benefits to cost ratio suggests that a new trial of the AmbIGeM system in GEMU wards may not be high-value compared to other potential trials, and that the system should be implemented. However, a broader analysis of options for preventing falls in GEMU is required to fully inform decision making.\nAustralian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12617000981325).", "Programming is a powerful and ubiquitous problem-solving tool. Systems that can assist programmers or even generate programs themselves could make programming more productive and accessible. Recent transformer-based neural network models show impressive code generation abilities yet still perform poorly on more complex tasks requiring problem-solving skills, such as competitive programming problems. Here, we introduce AlphaCode, a system for code generation that achieved an average ranking in the top 54.3% in simulated evaluations on recent programming competitions on the Codeforces platform. AlphaCode solves problems by generating millions of diverse programs using specially trained transformer-based networks and then filtering and clustering those programs to a maximum of just 10 submissions. This result marks the first time an artificial intelligence system has performed competitively in programming competitions.", "Decades of technical innovations have propelled musculoskeletal radiology through an astonishing evolution. New artificial intelligence and deep learning methods capitalize on many past innovations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to reach unprecedented speed, image quality, and new contrasts. Similarly exciting developments in computed tomography (CT) include clinically applicable molecular specificity and substantially improved spatial resolution of musculoskeletal structures and diseases. This special issue of Investigative Radiology comprises a collection of expert summaries and reviews on the most impactful innovations and cutting-edge topics in musculoskeletal radiology, including radiomics and deep learning methods for musculoskeletal disease detection, high-resolution MR neurography, deep learning-driven ultra-fast musculoskeletal MRI, MRI-based synthetic CT, quantitative MRI, modern low-field MRI, 7.0 T MRI, dual-energy CT, cone beam CT, kinematic CT, and synthetic contrast generation in musculoskeletal MRI.", "With the advent of cyber-physical system-based automation and intelligence, the development of flexible and wearable devices has dramatically enhanced. Evidently, this has led to the thrust to realize standalone and sufficiently-self-powered miniaturized devices for a variety of sensing and monitoring applications. To this end, a range of aspects needs to be carefully and synergistically optimized. These include the choice of material, micro-reservoir to suitably place the analytes, integrable electrodes, detection mechanism, microprocessor/microcontroller architecture, signal-processing, software, etc. In this context, several researchers are working toward developing novel flexible devices having a micro-reservoir, both in flow-through and stationary phases, integrated with graphanized zones created by simple benchtop lasers. Various substrates, like different kinds of cloths, papers, and polymers, have been harnessed to develop laser-ablated graphene regions along with a micro-reservoir to aptly place various analytes to be sensed/monitored. Likewise, similar substrates have been utilized for energy harvesting by fuel cell or solar routes and supercapacitor-based energy storage. Overall, realization of a prototype is envisioned by integrating various sub-systems, including sensory, energy harvesting, energy storage, and IoT sub-systems, on a single mini-platform. In this work, the diversified work toward developing such prototypes will be showcased and current and future commercialization potential will be projected.", "Shortages in qualified supervision and other resources prevent education personnel from rehearsing effective practices. Interactive simulations, although increasingly used in education, frequently require instructor management. Automated simulations rarely engage trainees in skills related to practice (eg, speech).\nWe evaluated the capability of delivering behavioral skills training through an automated virtual reality (VR) simulation using artificial intelligence to improve the implementation of a nondirective mathematical questioning strategy.\nWe recruited and randomly assigned 30 college-aged participants to equivalent treatment (ie, lecture, modeling, and VR; 15/30, 50%) and control groups (ie, lecture and modeling only; 15/30, 50%). The participants were blind to treatment conditions. Sessions and assessments were conducted face to face and involved the use of VR for assessment regardless of the condition. Lessons concerned the use of a nondirective mathematical questioning strategy in instances where a simulated student provided correct or incorrect answers to word problems. The measures included observed and automated assessments of participant performance and subjective assessments of participant confidence. The participants completed the pretest, posttest, and maintenance probes each week over the course of 3 weeks.\nA mixed ANOVA revealed significant main effects of time (F2,27=124.154; P<.001; \u03b7p2=0.816) and treatment (F1,28=19.281; P<.001; \u03b7p2=0.408) as well as an interaction effect (F2,28=8.429; P<.001; \u03b7p2=0.231) for the average percentage of steps in the questioning procedure. Posttest scores for the intervention group (mean 88%, SD 22.62%) exceeded those of the control group (mean 63.33%, SD 22.64%), with t28=3.653, P<.001, and Cohen d=1.334. Maintenance scores indicated a positive effect of the intervention (mean 83.33%, SD 24.40%) relative to the control (mean 54.67%, SD 15.98%), t28=3.807, P<.001, Cohen d=1.39. A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that the treatment groups' self-ratings of confidence (mean 2.41, SD 0.51) were higher than those of the control group (mean 2.04, SD 0.52), U=64, P=.04, r=0.137.\nThe results demonstrate the potential of artificial intelligence-augmented VR to deliver effective, evidence-based training with limited instructor management. Additional work is needed to demonstrate the cascading effect of training on authentic practice and to encompass a wider range of skills.", "Researchers have tried to identify and count different blood cells in microscopic smear images by using deep learning methods of artificial intelligence to solve the highly time-consuming problem.\nThe three types of blood cells are platelets, red blood cells, and white blood cells. This study used the Resnet50 network as a backbone network of the single shot detector (SSD) for automatically identifying and counting different blood cells and, meanwhile, proposed a systematic method to find a better combination of algorithm hyperparameters of the Resnet50 network for promoting accuracy for identifying and counting blood cells. The Resnet50 backbone network of the SSD with its optimized algorithm hyperparameters, which is called the Resnet50-SSD model, was developed to enhance the feature extraction ability for identifying and counting blood cells. Furthermore, the algorithm hyperparameters of Resnet50 backbone networks of the SSD were optimized by the Taguchi experimental method for promoting detection accuracy of the Resnet50-SSD model. The experimental result shows that the detection accuracy of the Resnet50-SSD model with 512\u2009\u00d7\u2009512\u2009\u00d7\u20093 input images was better than that of the Resnet50-SSD model with 300\u2009\u00d7\u2009300\u2009\u00d7\u20093 input images on the test set of blood cells images. Additionally, the detection accuracy of the Resnet50-SSD model using the combination of algorithm hyperparameters got by the Taguchi method was better than that of the Resnet50-SSD model using the combination of algorithm hyperparameters given by the Matlab example.\nIn blood cell images acquired from the BCCD dataset, the proposed Resnet50-SSD model had higher accuracy in identifying and counting blood cells, especially white blood cells and red blood cells.", "Objective: To explore the characteristics of visual function and eye diseases in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and mental retardation. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study. Two hundred and ninety-two cases (584 eyes) of children with ASD combined with mental retardation from 7 special education schools in Chaoyang District of Beijing, including 235 males (80.48%) and 57 females (19.52%); The age ranged from 2 to 18 years old. Subjective far and near vision, near stereoacuity, objective vision, diopter, anterior segment and fundus were examined. In addition, 300 students with normal intelligence level, aged 2 to 18 years, were included as controls. LogMAR was used to record vision examination. Subjective, objective vision and diopter were examined. Mann Whitney U test or Kruskal Wallis H test was used for the data of children with different genders, different age. Results: Among 584 eyes of children with ASD and mental retardation, 272 eyes (47.22%) were ametropia, 260 eyes (45.14%) were astigmatism, 29 eyes (5.03%) were hyperopia, 10 eyes (1.74%) were myopia, and 47 eyes (8.16%) were amblyopia risk factors. Among 292 children, there were 20 cases of strabismus (6.85%), 3 cases of color weakness (1.03%), and 4 cases of external eye abnormalities (1.37%). Two hundred and eleven children completed near stereopsis examination, of which 54 (25.59%) were within 100\u2033 and 157 (74.41%) were within 200\u2033 to 900\u2033. Two hundred and seventy-two eyes with ametropia, 157 eyes (57.72%) needed correction but did not. The median and quartile of subjective and objective logMAR visual acuity were 0.22(0.10, 0.35), 0.10(0.00, 0.22), respectively; There were no significant differences in far visual acuity, near visual acuity, objective visual acuity, diopter, and near stereoacuity between different genders of ASD children with mild or moderate mental retardation (all P>0.05); There was a statistically significant difference in ASD children with mild mental retardation at different age rangs (H=21.453, P<0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in subjective tests such as far visual acuity and near visual acuity, for children with moderate mental retardation (Z=-3.508, -4.503; P<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in objective visual acuity, diopter and near stereo acuity(all P>0.05). There are 300 healthy children as the control group, with LogMar's subjective far vision is 0.10(0.00, 0.22), and the objective vision is 0.00(0.00, 0.10), diopter 0.25 (-0.25, 0.50) D. Compared with healthy children, ASD children with mental retardation had a significant difference in subjective far vision and objective vision (Z=-8.527, -10.393; P<0.001). There was no significant difference in diopter (Z=-1.274, P=0.203). Conclusions: The subjective and objective visual acuity of children with ASD combined with mental retardation was lower than that of healthy children. The prevalence and uncorrected rate of refractive errors, strabismus, amblyopia and other eye diseases were significantly higher than those of healthy children. Their refractive errors were mainly astigmatism, and the rates of correction and treatment were low.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u5b64\u72ec\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\uff08ASD\uff09\u5408\u5e76\u667a\u529b\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u513f\u7684\u89c6\u529f\u80fd\u53ca\u773c\u90e8\u75be\u75c5\u7279\u70b9\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u6a2a\u65ad\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u4e8e2022\u5e741\u81f33\u6708\u7eb3\u5165\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u671d\u9633\u533a7\u6240\u7279\u6b8a\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u6821\u7684292\u4f8b\uff08584\u53ea\u773c\uff09ASD\u5408\u5e76\u667a\u529b\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u513f\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7537\u6027235\u4f8b\uff0c\u5973\u602757\u4f8b\uff1b\u5e74\u9f842~18\u5c81\u3002\u68c0\u67e5\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u513f\u4e3b\u89c2\u8fdc\u3001\u8fd1\u89c6\u529b\u3001\u8fd1\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u89c6\u529b\u3001\u5c48\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u3001\u773c\u524d\u8282\u548c\u773c\u5e95\u3002\u53e6\u7eb3\u5165\u5065\u5eb7\u5e7c\u513f\u53ca\u5b66\u751f300\u4eba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7167\uff0c\u5e74\u9f842~18\u5c81\uff0c\u68c0\u67e5\u4e3b\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u89c6\u529b\u548c\u5c48\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u3002\u5bf9ASD\u5408\u5e76\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u529b\u969c\u788d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u60a3\u513f\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u89c6\u529b\u7ed3\u679c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u5206\u8fa8\u89d2\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u522b\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u7684\u60a3\u513f\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u8f83\u91c7\u7528Mann-Whitney U\u68c0\u9a8c\u6216Kruskal-Wallis H\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a ASD\u5408\u5e76\u667a\u529b\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u513f\u7684584\u53ea\u773c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c48\u5149\u4e0d\u6b63272\u53ea\u773c\uff0847.22%\uff09\uff0c\u6563\u5149260\u53ea\u773c\uff0845.14%\uff09\uff0c\u8fdc\u89c629\u53ea\u773c\uff085.03%\uff09\uff0c\u8fd1\u89c610\u53ea\u773c\uff081.74%\uff09\uff0c\u5f31\u89c6\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d2047\u53ea\u773c\uff088.16%\uff09\u3002292\u4f8b\u60a3\u513f\u4e2d\u659c\u89c620\u4f8b\uff086.85%\uff09\uff0c\u8272\u5f313\u4f8b\uff081.03%\uff09\uff0c\u5916\u773c\u5f02\u5e384\u4f8b\uff081.37%\uff09\u3002211\u4f8b\u60a3\u513f\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u8fd1\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d100\u2033\u53ca\u4ee5\u5185\u800554\u4f8b\uff0825.59%\uff09\uff0c200\u2033~900\u2033\u8005157\u4f8b\uff0874.41%\uff09\u3002272\u53ea\u5c48\u5149\u4e0d\u6b63\u773c\u4e2d\uff0c157\u53ea\u773c\uff0857.72%\uff09\u9700\u77eb\u6b63\u800c\u672a\u77eb\u6b63\u3002\u60a3\u513f\u4e3b\u89c2\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u89c6\u529b\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.22\uff080.10\uff0c0.35\uff09\u548c0.10\uff080.00\uff0c0.22\uff09\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u522b\u7684ASD\u5408\u5e76\u8f7b\u5ea6\u6216\u4e2d\u5ea6\u667a\u529b\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u513f\u8fdc\u8fd1\u89c6\u529b\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u89c6\u529b\u3001\u5c48\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u3001\u8fd1\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5747\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P>0.05\uff09\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5ASD\u5408\u5e76\u8f7b\u5ea6\u667a\u529b\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u513f\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08H=21.453\uff0cP<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\u5ea6\u667a\u529b\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u513f\u4e3b\u89c2\u8fdc\u3001\u8fd1\u89c6\u529b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08Z=-3.508\uff0c-4.503\uff1bP<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u5ba2\u89c2\u89c6\u529b\u3001\u5c48\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u3001\u8fd1\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P>0.05\uff09\u3002\u5065\u5eb7\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u8fdc\u89c6\u529b\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u89c6\u529b\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.10\uff080.00\uff0c0.22\uff09\u548c0.00\uff080.00\uff0c0.10\uff09\uff0c\u5c48\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u4e3a0.25\uff08-0.25\uff0c0.50\uff09D\uff0c\u4e0eASD\u5408\u5e76\u667a\u529b\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u513f\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u8fdc\u89c6\u529b\u53ca\u5ba2\u89c2\u89c6\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08Z=-8.527\uff0c-10.393\uff1bP<0.001\uff09\uff0c\u5c48\u5149\u5ea6\u6570\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u65e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08Z=-1.274\uff0cP=0.203\uff09\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a ASD\u5408\u5e76\u667a\u529b\u969c\u788d\u60a3\u513f\u7684\u4e3b\u3001\u5ba2\u89c2\u89c6\u529b\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u513f\u7ae5\uff0c\u5c48\u5149\u4e0d\u6b63\u3001\u659c\u89c6\u3001\u5f31\u89c6\u7b49\u773c\u75c5\u7684\u60a3\u75c5\u7387\u548c\u672a\u77eb\u6b63\u7387\u5747\u660e\u663e\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u513f\u7ae5\uff0c\u5176\u6240\u60a3\u7684\u5c48\u5149\u4e0d\u6b63\u4e2d\u4ee5\u6563\u5149\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u4e14\u77eb\u6b63\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002.", "Alterations in neuronal activity and cerebral hemodynamics have been reported in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) patients, possibly resulting in neurovascular decoupling; however, no neuroimaging evidence confirmed this disruption. This study aimed to investigate the possible presence of neurovascular decoupling and its clinical implications in childhood IGE using resting-state fMRI and arterial spin labeling imaging.\nIGE patients and healthy participants underwent resting-state fMRI and arterial spin labeling imaging to calculate degree centrality (DC) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), respectively. Across-voxel CBF-DC correlations were analyzed to evaluate the neurovascular coupling within the whole gray matter, and the regional coupling of brain region was assessed with the CBF/DC ratio.\nThe study included 26 children with IGE and 35 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Compared with the HCs, the IGE group presented lower across-voxel CBF-DC correlations, higher CBF/DC ratio in the right posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, middle frontal gyrus, and medial frontal gyrus (MFG), and lower ratio in the left inferior frontal gyrus. The increased CBF/DC ratio in the right MFG was correlated with lower performance intelligence quotient scores in the IGE group.\nChildren with IGE present altered neurovascular coupling, associated with lower performance intelligence quotient scores. The study shed a new insight into the pathophysiology of epilepsy and provided potential imaging biomarkers of cognitive performances in children with IGE.", "This study aimed to examine the impact of childhood maltreatment on callous-unemotional (CU) traits among incarcerated male adolescents, focusing primarily on the roles of parental attachment and emotional intelligence. A total of 454 male incarcerated adolescents from two juvenile correctional facilities, ranging in age from 14 to 18\u00a0years, completed a set of questionnaires consisting of a childhood trauma questionnaire, parent-attachment scale, emotional intelligence scale, and the Inventory of CU traits. The results revealed that childhood maltreatment, parental attachment, and emotional intelligence were all correlated with CU traits. Structural equation modeling analysis and the bootstrap test indicated that parental attachment and emotional intelligence mediated, in part, the effect of childhood maltreatment on CU traits. These findings expand the outcomes of previous research and shed light on how childhood maltreatment is related to CU traits.", "Assessing the time required for tooth extraction is the most important factor to consider before surgeries. The purpose of this study was to create a practical predictive model for assessing the time to extract the mandibular third molar tooth using deep learning. The accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing the extraction time predicted by deep learning with the actual time required for extraction.\nA total of 724 panoramic X-ray images and clinical data were used for artificial intelligence (AI) prediction of extraction time. Clinical data such as age, sex, maximum mouth opening, body weight, height, the time from the start of incision to the start of suture, and surgeon's experience were recorded. Data augmentation and weight balancing were used to improve learning abilities of AI models. Extraction time predicted by the concatenated AI model was compared with the actual extraction time.\nThe final combined model (CNN\u2009+\u2009MLP) model achieved an R value of 0.8315, an R-squared value of 0.6839, a p-value of less than 0.0001, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.95\u00a0min with the test dataset.\nOur proposed model for predicting time to extract the mandibular third molar tooth performs well with a high accuracy in clinical practice.", "The field of clinical genetics and genomics continues to evolve. In the past few decades, milestones like the initial sequencing of the human genome, dramatic changes in sequencing technologies, and the introduction of artificial intelligence, have upended the field and offered fascinating new insights. Though difficult to predict the precise paths the field will follow, rapid change may continue to be inevitable. Within genetics, the practice of dysmorphology, as defined by pioneering geneticist David W. Smith in the 1960s as \"the study of, or general subject of abnormal development of tissue form\" has also been affected by technological advances as well as more general trends in biomedicine. To address possibilities, potential, and perils regarding the future of dysmorphology, a group of clinical geneticists, representing different career stages, areas of focus, and geographic regions, have contributed to this piece by providing insights about how the practice of dysmorphology will develop over the next several decades.", "Photonic artificial intelligence has attracted considerable interest in accelerating machine learning; however, the unique optical properties have not been fully used for achieving higher-order functionalities. Chaotic itinerancy, with its spontaneous transient dynamics among multiple quasi-attractors, can be used to realize brain-like functionalities. In this study, we numerically and experimentally investigate a method for controlling the chaotic itinerancy in a multimode semiconductor laser to solve a machine learning task, namely, the multiarmed bandit problem, which is fundamental to reinforcement learning. The proposed method uses chaotic itinerant motion in mode competition dynamics controlled via optical injection. We found that the exploration mechanism is completely different from a conventional searching algorithm and is highly scalable, outperforming the conventional approaches for large-scale bandit problems. This study paves the way to use chaotic itinerancy for effectively solving complex machine learning tasks as photonic hardware accelerators.", "A disproportionately high number of deadly crash-incidents involve fire-tanker rollovers during emergency response driving. Most of these rollover incidents occur at dangerous horizontal curves (\"curves\") due to unsafe speed. This study examined the effects of a curve speed warning system (CSWS) on fire tanker drivers' emergency response behavior to develop system improvement suggestions.\nTwenty-four firefighters participated in driving tests using a simulator. A fire tanker model, carrying a full tank of water, was used in emergency driving tests performed with and without CSWS. The CSWS was designed using the algorithm for passenger vehicles with a few initial modifications considering the unique requirements of heavy fire tanker and emergency driving.\nThe results indicated that the CSWS was effective in issuing preemptive warnings when the drivers were approaching curves with unsafe speed during emergency response. Warnings occurred more frequently at curves with smaller radius. Although the CSWS improved driving performance, it did not significantly reduce the number of rollover events. A detailed analysis of the rollover events provided suggestions for improvement of CSWS algorithms.\nTo further improve the CSWS algorithm, the following may be considered: including increased safety speed margin below the rollover critical speed, moving the speed warning trigger from the curve apex to the curve entry point, extending the safe speed-control zone to cover the entire curve, and employing artificial intelligence to accommodate individual driving styles.\nFire tankers continue to be at increased risk of rollover during emergency response due to unsafe negotiation of dangerous curves. Development and use of advanced driver assist systems such as CSWS evaluated in this study may be an effective strategy to prevent deadly rollover crash-incidents. The knowledge generated by this study will be useful for system designers to improve the CSWS specifically designed for heavy emergency vehicles.", "Deep learning algorithms have lately been used for medical image processing, and they have showed promise in a range of applications. The purpose of this study was to develop and test computer-based diagnostic tools for evaluating masseter muscle segmentation on ultrasonography images.\nA total of 388 anonymous adult masseter muscle retrospective ultrasonographic images were evaluated. The masseter muscle was labeled on ultrasonography images using the polygonal type labeling method with the CranioCatch labeling program (CranioCatch, Eski\u015fehir, Turkey). All images were re-checked and verified by Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology experts. This data set was divided into training (n = 312), verification (n = 38) and test (n = 38) sets. In the study, an artificial intelligence model was developed using PyTorch U-Net architecture, which is a deep learning approach.\nIn our study, the artificial intelligence deep learning model known as U-net provided the detection and segmentation of all test images, and when the success rate in the estimation of the images was evaluated, the F1, sensitivity and precision results of the model were 1.0, 1.0 and 1.0, respectively.\nArtificial intelligence shows promise in automatic segmentation of masseter muscle on ultrasonography images. This strategy can aid surgeons, radiologists, and other medical practitioners in reducing diagnostic time.", "Liver is an organ having extremely diversified functions, ranging from metabolic and synthetic to detoxification of harmful chemicals. The multifunctionality of the liver in principle requires the multidisciplinary and pluralistic interventions for its management. Several studies have investigated liver function, dysfunction and clinic. This editorial work discusses new ideas, challenges and perspectives of current research regarding multidisciplinary and pluralistic management of liver diseases. In one hand the discussions have carried out on the involvement of extracellular vesicles, Na+/H+ exchangers, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Epstein-Barr virus infections, Drug-induced liver injury, sepsis, pregnancy, and food supplements in hepatic disorders. In the other hand this study has discussed hepatocellular carcinoma algorithms and new biochemical and imaging experiments pertaining to liver diseases. Relevant articles with an impact index value \"> 0\" from reference citation analysis, which is an open multidisciplinary citation analysis database based on artificial intelligence technology, have served for the study's argumentation. This work may be a useful tool for the clinical practice and research in managing and investigating liver disorders.", "Understanding how proteins evolve under selective pressure is a longstanding challenge. The immensity of the search space has limited efforts to systematically evaluate the impact of multiple simultaneous mutations, so mutations have typically been assessed individually. However, epistasis, or the way in which mutations interact, prevents accurate prediction of combinatorial mutations based on measurements of individual mutations. Here, we use artificial intelligence to define the entire functional sequence landscape of a protein binding site in silico, and we call this approach Complete Combinatorial Mutational Enumeration (CCME). By leveraging CCME, we are able to construct a comprehensive map of the evolutionary connectivity within this functional sequence landscape. As a proof of concept, we applied CCME to the ACE2 binding site of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain. We selected representative variants from across the functional sequence landscape for testing in the laboratory. We identified variants that retained functionality to bind ACE2 despite changing over 40% of evaluated residue positions, and the variants now escape binding and neutralization by monoclonal antibodies. This work represents a crucial initial stride towards achieving precise predictions of pathogen evolution, opening avenues for proactive mitigation.", "The purpose of this article consists of analyzing publications discussing the use of agent-based artificial intelligence models in sustainable agriculture research. The analysis involved bibliometric indicators and the Rstudio software with Bibliometrix library. The methodology is descriptive with a quantitative approach. Scientific databases SCOPUS and Web of Science were consulted and the PRISMA methodology was used during the selection process. This led to finding 86 publications that met the inclusion criteria. Amongst the results, United States was listed as the country with the highest production of scientific material, although France had a higher impact. Additionally, the bibliographical resources that help promote scientific development are open source. It was concluded that the agent-based model has been adopted to simulate different scenarios, which help decision-makers to formulate public policies in favor of sustainable agriculture. This optimizes the use of natural resources and reduces negative consequences for the environment, while also delivering value for the stakeholders of the agricultural system.", "Established telehealth practices in pediatrics and pediatric cardiology are evolving rapidly. This review examines several concepts in contemporary telemedicine in our field: recent changes in direct-to-consumer (DTC) pediatric telehealth (TH) and practice based on lessons learned from the pandemic, scientific data from newer technological innovations in pediatric cardiology, and how TH is shaping global pediatric cardiology practice.\nIn 2020, the global pandemic of COVID-19 led to significant changes in healthcare delivery. The lockdown and social distancing guidelines accelerated smart adaptations and pivots to ensure continued pediatric care albeit in a virtual manner. Remote cardiac monitoring technology is continuing to advance at a rapid pace secondary to advances in the areas of Internet access, portable hand-held devices, and artificial intelligence.\nTH should be approached programmatically by pediatric cardiac healthcare providers with careful selection of patients, technology platforms, infrastructure setup, documentation, and compliance. Payment parity with in-person visits should be advocated and legislated. Newer remote cardiac monitoring technology should be expanded for objective assessment and optimal outcomes. TH continues to be working beyond geographical boundaries in pediatric cardiology and should continue to expand and develop.", "An increasing number of studies have reported using natural language processing (NLP) to assist observational research by extracting clinical information from electronic health records (EHRs). Currently, no standardized reporting guidelines for NLP-assisted observational studies exist. The absence of detailed reporting guidelines may create ambiguity in the use of NLP-derived content, knowledge gaps in the current research reporting practices, and reproducibility challenges. To address these issues, we conducted a scoping review of NLP-assisted observational clinical studies and examined their reporting practices, focusing on NLP methodology and evaluation. Through our investigation, we discovered a high variation regarding the reporting practices, such as inconsistent use of references for measurement studies, variation in the\u00a0reporting location (reference, appendix, and manuscript), and different granularity of NLP methodology and evaluation details. To promote the wide adoption and utilization of NLP solutions in clinical research, we outline several perspectives that align with the six principles released by the World Health Organization (WHO) that guide the ethical use of artificial intelligence for health.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a potentially transformative force that is likely to change the role of management and organizational practices. AI is revolutionizing corporate decision-making and changing management structures. The visible effects of AI can be observed in key competencies and corporate processes such as knowledge management, as well as consumer outcomes including service quality perceptions and satisfaction. This study aims to optimize the human resource management (HRM) process, reduce the workload of human resource managers, and improve work efficiency. Based on AI digitization technology, a salary prediction model (SPM) is designed using a backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and the Nesterov and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Nadam) algorithms are integrated to optimize the model. Next, the content information of the resumes are used to predict the hiring salary of the candidates and validate the model. Results show that compared with other optimization algorithms, the final predicted result score of the Nadam optimization algorithm is 0.75%, and the training period is 186\u2009s, providing the best optimization effect and the fastest convergence speed. Moreover, the BPNN-based SPM optimized by Nadam has good performance in the learning process and the accuracy rate can reach 79.4%, which verifies the validity of the SPM. The outcomes of this study can provide a reference for HRM systems based on data mining technology.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied increasingly in the medical field during the past 5 years. Within respiratory medicine, chest imaging AI is one of the relevant hotspots, commonly trained to identify pulmonary nodules/lung tumors, tuberculosis, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism and other pathologies. Due to the non-specific clinical manifestations and the low detection rate of pathogens, precise diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia remain challengeable. Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), chest imaging AI has demonstrated its clinical value in accurate diagnosis and quantitative measurements of COVID-19. Moreover, an AI system can assist the clinicians to identify the high-risk COVID-19 patients who warrant close monitoring and timely intervention. However, there are still some limitations in the existing studies, such as small sample size, lack of multi-modal assessment of the AI model, and rough classification of pneumonia. Therefore, some suggestions for future research were put forward in this paper. Most of all, more attention should be paid to the collection of high-quality datasets, standardization of image annotation, technology innovation, algorithm optimization and model verification. Besides, the application of imaging AI on other types of pneumonia including viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia and pneumomycosis deserves further study. In conclusion, chest imaging AI is expected to play a vital role in decision-making for pneumonia in the future.\n\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\uff0c\u5f71\u50cfAI\u662f\u6700\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u70ed\u70b9\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u9274\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8868\u73b0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u75c5\u539f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u4f4e\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u80ba\u708e\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bca\u7597\u9762\u4e34\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u80ba\u708e\uff08\u7b80\u79f0\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\uff09\u75ab\u60c5\u66b4\u53d1\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u80f8\u90e8\u5f71\u50cfAI\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u75c5\u7076\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u9884\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5982\u7814\u7a76\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u80ba\u708e\u5206\u7c7b\u6b20\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7b49\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f71\u50cfAI\u8f85\u52a9\u80ba\u708e\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u4eca\u540e\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u548cAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cd\u89c6AI\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u80ba\u708e\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u5f71\u50cfAI\u4e3a\u80ba\u708e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u53c2\u8003\u3002.", "The European Molecular Biology Laboratory's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) is one of the world's leading sources of public biomolecular data. Based at the Wellcome Genome Campus in Hinxton, UK, EMBL-EBI is one of six sites of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Europe's only intergovernmental life sciences organisation. This overview summarises the status of services that EMBL-EBI data resources provide to scientific communities globally. The scale, openness, rich metadata and extensive curation of EMBL-EBI added-value databases makes them particularly well-suited as training sets for deep learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, a selection of which are described here. The data resources at EMBL-EBI can catalyse such developments because they offer sustainable, high-quality data, collected in some cases over decades and made openly availability to any researcher, globally. Our aim is for EMBL-EBI data resources to keep providing the\u00a0foundations for tools and research insights that transform fields across the life sciences.", "Narrow-band imaging (NBI) is an optical digital enhancement method that allows the observation of vascular and surface structures of colorectal lesions. Its usefulness in the detection and diagnosis of colorectal polyps has been demonstrated in several clinical trials and the diagnostic algorithms have been simplified after the establishment of endoscopic classifications such as the Japan NBI Expert Team classification. However, there were issues including lack of brightness in the earlier models, poor visibility under insufficient bowel preparation, and the incompatibility of magnifying endoscopes in certain endoscopic platforms, which had impeded NBI from becoming standardized globally. Nonetheless, NBI continued its evolution and the newest endoscopic platform launched in 2020 offers significantly brighter and detailed images. Enhanced visualization is expected to improve the detection of polyps while universal compatibility across all scopes including magnifying endoscopy will promote the global standardization of magnifying diagnosis. Therefore, knowledge related to magnifying colonoscopy will become essential as magnification becomes standardly equipped in future models, although the advent of computer-aided diagnosis and detection may greatly assist endoscopists to ensure quality of practice. Given that most endoscopic departments will be using both old and new models, it is important to understand how each generation of endoscopic platforms differ from each other. We reviewed the advances in the endoscopic platforms, artificial intelligence, and evidence related to NBI essential for the next generation of endoscopic practice.", "The present study examines the direct and indirect effects of trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) on levels of stress, anxiety and depression, and whether these are moderated by coping strategies. To this end, the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, Coping Strategies Inventory and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales were administered to 567 university students. The findings point to a direct relationship between EI and the levels of anxiety, depression and stress. EI directly explained the university students' levels of anxiety, depression and stress, and it indirectly explained such levels through coping strategies. The article concludes by pointing out practical implications for university education and the improvement of students' socio-emotional well-being.", "The ultimate goal of human assisted reproductive technology is to achieve a healthy pregnancy and birth, ideally from the selection and transfer of a single competent embryo. Recently, techniques for efficiently evaluating the state and quality of preimplantation embryos using time-lapse imaging systems have been applied. Artificial intelligence programs based on deep learning technology and big data analysis of time-lapse monitoring system during in vitro culture of preimplantation embryos have also been rapidly developed. In addition, several molecular markers of the secretome have been successfully analyzed in spent embryo culture media, which could easily be obtained during in vitro embryo culture. It is also possible to analyze small amounts of cell-free nucleic acids, mitochondrial nucleic acids, miRNA, and long non-coding RNA derived from embryos using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or digital PCR, as well as next-generation sequencing. Various efforts are being made to use non-invasive evaluation of embryo quality (NiEEQ) to select the embryo with the best developmental competence. However, each NiEEQ method has some limitations that should be evaluated case by case. Therefore, an integrated analysis strategy fusing several NiEEQ methods should be urgently developed and confirmed by proper clinical trials.", "Taiwan has insufficient nursing resources due to the high turnover rate of health care providers. Therefore, reducing the heavy workload of these employees is essential. Herein, speech transcription, which has various potential clinical applications, was employed for the documentation of nursing records. The requirement of including only one speaker per transcription facilitated data collection and system development. Moreover, authorization from patients was unnecessary.\nThe aim of this study was to construct a speech recognition system for nursing records such that health care providers can complete nursing records without typing or with only a few edits.\nNursing records in Taiwan are mainly written in Mandarin, with technical terms and abbreviations presented in both Mandarin and English. Therefore, the training set consisted of English code-switching information. Next, transfer learning (TL) and meta-TL (MTL) methods, which perform favorably in code-switching scenarios, were applied.\nAs of September 2021, the China Medical University Hospital Artificial Intelligence Speech (CMaiSpeech) data set was established by manually annotating approximately 100 hours of recordings from 525 speakers. The word error rate (WER) of the benchmark model of syllable-based TL was 29.54% in code-switching. The WER of the proposed model of syllable-based MTL was 22.20% in code-switching. The test set comprised 17,247 words. Moreover, in a clinical case, the proposed model of syllable-based MTL yielded a WER of 31.06% in code-switching. The clinical test set contained 1159 words.\nThis paper has two main contributions. First, the CMaiSpeech data set-a Mandarin-English corpus-has been established. Health care providers in Taiwan are often compelled to use a mixture of Mandarin and English in nursing records. Second, an automatic speech recognition system for nursing record document conversion was proposed. The proposed system can shorten the work handover time and further reduce the workload of health care providers.", "Recent studies show promising potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to assist healthcare providers (HCPs) in skin cancer care. The aim of this study is to explore the views of dermatologists and general practitioners (GPs) regarding the successful implementation of AI when assisting HCPs in skin cancer care. We performed a qualitative focus group study, consisting of six focus groups with 16 dermatologists and 17 GPs, varying in prior knowledge and experience with AI, gender, and age. An in-depth inductive thematic content analysis was deployed. Perceived benefits, barriers, and preconditions were identified as main themes. Dermatologists and GPs perceive substantial benefits of AI, particularly an improved health outcome and care pathway between primary and secondary care. Doubts about accuracy, risk of health inequalities, and fear of replacement were among the most stressed barriers. Essential preconditions included adequate algorithm content, sufficient usability, and accessibility of AI. In conclusion, dermatologists and GPs perceive significant benefits from implementing AI in skin cancer care. However, to successfully implement AI, key barriers need to be addressed. Efforts should focus on ensuring algorithm transparency, validation, accessibility for all skin types, and adequate regulation of algorithms. Simultaneously, improving knowledge about AI could reduce the fear of replacement.", "4-Thio-substituted phenylalkylamines such as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine (2C-T-2) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-n-propylthiophenethylamine (2C-T-7) produce psychedelic effects in humans and have been distributed as recreational drugs.\nThe present studies were conducted to examine the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of a series of 4-thio-substituted phenylalkylamines using the head twitch response (HTR), a 5-HT2A receptor-mediated behavior induced by psychedelic drugs in mice. The HTR is commonly used as a behavioral proxy in rodents for human psychedelic effects and can be used to discriminate hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonists.\nHTR dose-response studies with twelve different 4-thio-substituted phenylalkylamines were conducted in male C57BL/6\u00a0J mice. To detect the HTR, head movement was recorded electronically using a magnetometer coil and then head twitches were identified in the recordings using a validated method based on artificial intelligence.\n2C-T, the parent compound of this series, had relatively low potency in the HTR paradigm, but adding an \u03b1-methyl group increased potency fivefold. Potency was also increased when the 4-methylthio group was extended by one to three methylene units. Fluorination of the 4-position alkylthio chain, however, was detrimental for activity, as was the presence of a 4-allylthio substituent versus a propylthio group. 2C-T analogs containing a 4-benzylthio group showed little or no effect in the HTR paradigm, which is consistent with evidence that bulky 4-substituents can dampen agonist efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor. Binding and functional studies confirmed that the compounds have nanomolar affinity for 5-HT2 receptor subtypes and act as partial agonists at 5-HT2A.\nIn general, there were close parallels between the HTR data and the known SAR governing activity of phenylalkylamines at the 5-HT2A receptor. These findings further support the classification of 2C-T compounds as psychedelic drugs.", "Currently early diagnosis of malignant lesions at the periphery of lung parenchyma requires guidance of the biopsy needle catheter from the bronchoscope into the smaller peripheral airways via harmful X-ray radiation. Previously, we developed an image-guided system, iMTECH which uses electromagnetic tracking and although it increases the precision of biopsy collection and minimizes the use of harmful X-ray radiation during the interventional procedures, it only traces the tip of the biopsy catheter leaving the remaining catheter untraceable in real time and therefore increasing image registration error. To address this issue, we developed a shape sensing guidance system containing a fiber-Bragg grating (FBG) catheter and an artificial intelligence (AI) software, AIrShape to track and guide the entire biopsy instrument inside the lung airways, without radiation or electromagnetic navigation. We used a FBG fiber with one central and three peripheral cores positioned at 120\u00b0 from each other, an array of 25 draw tower gratings with 1cm/3nm spacing, 2 mm grating length, Ormocer-T coating, and a total outer diameter of 0.2 mm. The FBG fiber was placed in the working channel of a custom made three-lumen catheter with a tip bending mechanism (FBG catheter). The AIrShape software determines the position of the FBG catheter by superimposing its position to the lung airway center lines using an AI algorithm. The feasibility of the FBG system was tested in an anatomically accurate lung airway model and validated visually and with the iMTECH platform. The results prove a viable shape-sensing hardware and software navigation solution for flexible medical instruments to reach the peripheral airways. During future studies, the feasibility of FBG catheter will be tested in pre-clinical animal models.", "Advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms can assist rapid medical image recognition and realize automatic, efficient, noninvasive, and convenient diagnosis. We aim to further evaluate the diagnostic performance of ML to distinguish patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) from normal older adults based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nThe Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant literature published up until July 2021. We used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool and Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) to evaluate all included studies' quality and potential bias. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity, and the Deeks' test was used to assess publication bias.\nWe included 24 models based on different brain features extracted by ML algorithms in 19 papers. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve for ML in detecting AD were 0.85 (95%CI 0.81-0.89), 0.88 (95%CI 0.84-0.91), 7.15 (95%CI 5.40-9.47), 0.17 (95%CI 0.12-0.22), 43.34 (95%CI 26.89-69.84), and 0.93 (95%CI 0.91-0.95).\nML using structural MRI data performed well in diagnosing probable AD patients and normal elderly. However, more high-quality, large-scale prospective studies are needed to further enhance the reliability and generalizability of ML for clinical applications before it can be introduced into clinical practice.", "Risk prediction requires comprehensive integration of clinical information and concurrent radiological findings. We present an upgraded chest radiograph (CXR) explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) model, which was trained on 241,723 well-annotated CXRs obtained prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for detection of 20 radiographic features was 0.955 (95% CI 0.938-0.955) on PA view and 0.909 (95% CI 0.890-0.925) on AP view. Coexistent and correlated radiographic findings are displayed in an interpretation table, and calibrated classifier confidence is displayed on an AI scoreboard. Retrieval of similar feature patches and comparable CXRs from a Model-Derived Atlas provides justification for model predictions. To demonstrate the feasibility of a fine-tuning approach for efficient and scalable development of xAI risk prediction models, we applied our CXR xAI model, in combination with clinical information, to predict oxygen requirement in COVID-19 patients. Prediction accuracy for high flow oxygen (HFO) and mechanical ventilation (MV) was 0.953 and 0.934 at 24\u00a0h and 0.932 and 0.836 at 72\u00a0h from the time of emergency department (ED) admission, respectively. Our CXR xAI model is auditable and captures key pathophysiological manifestations of cardiorespiratory diseases and cardiothoracic comorbidities. This model can be efficiently and broadly applied via a fine-tuning approach to provide fully automated risk and outcome predictions in various clinical scenarios in real-world practice.", "Radiology, being one of the younger disciplines of medicine with a history of just over a century, has witnessed tremendous technological advancements and has revolutionized the way we practice medicine today. In the last few decades, medical imaging modalities have generated seismic amounts of medical data. The development and adoption of artificial intelligence applications using this data will lead to the next phase of evolution in radiology. It will include automating laborious manual tasks such as annotations, report generation, etc, along with the initial radiological assessment of patients and imaging features to aid radiologists in their diagnostic and treatment planning workflow. We propose a level-wise classification for the progression of automation in radiology, explaining artificial intelligence assistance at each level with the corresponding challenges and solutions. We hope that such discussions can help us address challenges in a structured way and take the necessary steps to ensure the smooth adoption of new technologies in radiology.", "To construct a new pulmonary nodule diagnostic model with high diagnostic efficiency, non-invasive and simple to measure.\nThis study included 424 patients with radioactive pulmonary nodules who underwent preoperative 7-autoantibody (7-AAB) panel testing, CT-based AI diagnosis, and pathological diagnosis by surgical resection. The patients were randomly divided into a training set\u00a0(n = 212) and a\u00a0validation set\u00a0(n = 212). The nomogram was developed through forward stepwise logistic regression based on the predictive factors identified by univariate and multivariate analyses in the training set and was verified internally in the verification set.\nA diagnostic nomogram was constructed based on the statistically significant variables of age as well as CT-based AI diagnostic, 7-AAB panel, and CEA test results. In the validation set, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and AUC were 82.29%, 90.48%, 97.24%, and 0.899 (95%[CI], 0.851-0.936), respectively. The nomogram showed significantly higher sensitivity than the 7-AAB panel test result (82.29% vs. 35.88%, p < 0.001) and CEA (82.29% vs. 18.82%, p < 0.001); it also had a significantly higher specificity than AI diagnosis (90.48% vs. 69.04%, p = 0.022). For lesions with a diameter of \u2264 2 cm, the specificity of the Nomogram was higher than that of the AI diagnostic system (90.00% vs. 67.50%, p = 0.022).\nBased on the combination of a 7-AAB panel, an AI diagnostic system, and other clinical features, our Nomogram demonstrated good diagnostic performance in distinguishing lung nodules, especially those with \u2264 2 cm diameters.\n\u2022 A novel diagnostic model of lung nodules was constructed by combining high-specific tumor markers with a high-sensitivity artificial intelligence diagnostic system. \u2022 The diagnostic model has good diagnostic performance in distinguishing malignant and benign pulmonary nodules, especially for nodules smaller than 2 cm. \u2022 The diagnostic model can assist the clinical decision-making of pulmonary nodules, with the advantages of high diagnostic efficiency, noninvasive, and simple measurement.", "Stature estimation is one of the most basic and important methods of personal identification. The long bones of the limbs provide the most accurate stature estimation, with the femur being one of the most useful. In all the previously reported methods of stature estimation using computed tomography (CT) images of the femur, laborious manual measurement was necessary. A semi-automatic bone measuring method can simplify this process, so we firstly reported a stature estimation process using semi-automatic bone measurement software equipped with artificial intelligence. Multiple measurements of femurs of adult Japanese cadavers were performed using automatic three-dimensional reconstructed CT images of femurs. After manually setting four points on the femur, an automatic measurement was acquired. The relationships between stature and five femoral measurements, with acceptable intraobserver and interobserver errors, were analyzed with single regression analysis using the standard error of the estimate (SEE) and the coefficient of determination (R2). The maximum length of the femur (MLF) provided the lowest SEE and the highest R2; the SEE and R2 in all cadavers, males and females, respectively, were 3.913\u00a0cm (R2\u2009=\u20090.842), 3.664\u00a0cm (R2\u2009=\u20090.705), and 3.456\u00a0cm (R2\u2009=\u20090.686) for MLF on the right femur, and 3.837\u00a0cm (R2\u2009=\u20090.848), 3.667\u00a0cm (R2\u2009=\u20090.705), and 3.384\u00a0cm (R2\u2009=\u20090.699) for MLF on the left femur. These results were non-inferior to those of previous reports regarding stature estimation using the MLF. Stature estimation with this simple and time-saving method would be useful in forensic medical practice.", "Over recent years, positive airway pressure (PAP) remote monitoring has transformed the management of OSA and produced a large amount of data. Accumulated PAP data provide valuable and objective information regarding patient treatment adherence and efficiency. However, the majority of studies that have analyzed longitudinal PAP remote monitoring have summarized data trajectories in static and simplistic metrics for PAP adherence and the residual apnea-hypopnea index by the use of mean or median values. The aims of this article are to suggest directions for improving data cleaning and processing and to address major concerns for the following data science applications: (1) conditions for residual apnea-hypopnea index reliability, (2) lack of standardization of indicators provided by different PAP models, (3) missing values, and (4) consideration of treatment interruptions. To allow fair comparison among studies and to avoid biases in computation, PAP data processing and management should be conducted rigorously with these points in mind. PAP remote monitoring data contain a wealth of information that currently is underused in the field of sleep research. Improving the quality and standardizing data handling could facilitate data sharing among specialists worldwide and enable artificial intelligence strategies to be applied in the field of sleep apnea.", "Panspermia is the philosophical proposition that the precursors of life are present in space and able to initiate life on reaching a suitable environment (especially the Earth). Only in the past century has the subject advanced from the lowly status of a dreamy hypothesis to a vibrant new science that is testable and observable. This history of panspermia presents the major figures associated with such hypotheses. It examines their motives, methods, and arguments, situated when possible in their historical context and culture rather than their impact on the present. From antiquity to the early modern period (1500-1800), the debates on the plurality of worlds and panspermia overlapped considerably. In the later modern period (1800 to the present), the narrative thread interweaves panspermia with the origin of life and the theory of evolution, and we can see authentic inputs from scientists rather than philosophers. In the interests of concision, I have omitted topics such as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, the exploration of the solar system by probes and landers, planetary protection (the inverse of panspermia), and the discovery of exoplanets. The historical literature is sometimes confusing: to correct for that, I have personally examined the original sources of every work cited rather than simply accepting the published findings of other scholars at face value.", "Physicians assume leadership roles in their health care organizations and practices often without support or training. The Physicians Leadership Academy provides integrated leadership seminars, mindfulness training, and executive coaching in a 10-month curriculum to physicians across area organizations.\nProgram evaluators responded to stakeholders' need for continuous program improvement by developing a continuous feedback loop evaluation design incorporating a program monitoring system and a theory-driven program evaluation. Given the size of the 2019 to 20 cohort ( n = 19), a one-group pretest/posttest design was used to assess the mechanisms of the program (mindfulness and wellbeing) along with knowledge development, emotional intelligence, and personal and professional growth. The assessments used a combination of published and administrator-developed assessments to address the unique aspects of the program. Doing such ensured continuous improvement and sustainability for the program.\nThe cohort of physicians demonstrated significant engagement and learning across the curriculum, improved mindfulness, and improved capacity of the providers to affect their health care system and communities.\nThe utility of the program was demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative analyses. Implications of the methodology for future evaluations of program developments are discussed.", "To explore the neural difference between children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and healthy controls, together with the relation between this difference and clinical severity indicator of children with OSA.\nTwenty-seven children with OSA (7.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5 years, apnea hypopnea index [AHI]: 9.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3 events/h) and 30 healthy controls (7.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6 years, AHI: 1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 events/h) were recruited and matched with age, gender, and handedness. All children underwent 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cognitive testing evaluating. Volumetric segmentation of cortical and subcortical structures and voxel-based morphometry were performed. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed between these features of gray matter volume (GMV) and obstructive apnea index (OAI) among children with OSA.\nIn the comparison of children's Wechsler test scores of full-scale intelligence quotient and verbal intelligence quotient, the OSA group was significantly lower than the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Compared with the control group, the GMV of many brain regions in the OSA group was significantly decreased (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In the correlation analysis of GMV and OAI in OSA group, right inferior frontal gyrus volume was significantly negatively correlated with OAI (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.49, p\u2009=\u20090.02).\nChildren with OSA presented abnormal neural activities in some brain regions and impaired cognitive functions. This finding suggests an association between the OSA and decreased GMV in children.", "EEG has been used for decades to identify neurocognitive processes related to intelligence. Evidence is accumulating for associations with neural markers of higher-order cognitive processes (e.g., working memory); however, whether associations are specific to complex processes or also relate to earlier processing stages remains unclear. Addressing these issues has implications for improving our understanding of intelligence and its neural correlates. The MMN is an ERP that is elicited when, within a series of frequent standard stimuli, rare deviant stimuli are presented. As stimuli are typically presented outside the focus of attention, the MMN is suggested to capture automatic pre-attentive discrimination processes. However, the MMN and its relation to intelligence has largely only been studied in the auditory domain, thus preventing conclusions about the involvement of automatic discrimination processes in humans' dominant sensory modality-vision. EEG was recorded from 50 healthy participants during a passive visual oddball task that presented simple sequence violations and deviations within a more complex hidden pattern. Signed area amplitudes and fractional area latencies of the visual MMN were calculated with and without Laplacian transformation. Correlations between visual MMN and intelligence (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices) were of negligible to small effect sizes, differed critically between measurement approaches, and Bayes Factors provided anecdotal to substantial evidence for the absence of an association. We discuss differences between the auditory and visual MMN, the implications of different measurement approaches, and offer recommendations for further research in this evolving field.", "COVID-19 infection, especially in cases with pneumonia, is associated with a high rate of pulmonary embolism (PE). In patients with contraindications for CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or non-diagnostic CTPA, perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (Q-SPECT/CT) is a diagnostic alternative. The goal of this study is to develop a radiomic diagnostic system to detect PE based only on the analysis of Q-SPECT/CT scans.\nThis radiomic diagnostic system is based on a local analysis of Q-SPECT/CT volumes that includes both CT and Q-SPECT values for each volume point. We present a combined approach that uses radiomic features extracted from each scan as input into a fully connected classification neural network that optimizes a weighted cross-entropy loss trained to discriminate between three different types of image patterns (pixel sample level): healthy lungs (control group), PE and pneumonia. Four types of models using different configuration of parameters were tested.\nThe proposed radiomic diagnostic system was trained on 20 patients (4,927 sets of samples of three types of image patterns) and validated in a group of 39 patients (4,410 sets of samples of three types of image patterns). In the training group, COVID-19 infection corresponded to 45% of the cases and 51.28% in the test group. In the test group, the best model for determining different types of image patterns with PE presented a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 75.1%, 98.2%, 88.9% and 95.4%, respectively. The best model for detecting pneumonia presented a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 94.1%, 93.6%, 85.2% and 97.6%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.92 for PE and 0.91 for pneumonia. When the results obtained at the pixel sample level are aggregated into regions of interest, the sensitivity of the PE increases to 85%, and all metrics improve for pneumonia.\nThis radiomic diagnostic system was able to identify the different lung imaging patterns and is a first step toward a comprehensive intelligent radiomic system to optimize the diagnosis of PE by Q-SPECT/CT.\nArtificial intelligence applied to Q-SPECT/CT is a diagnostic option in patients with contraindications to CTPA or a non-diagnostic test in times of COVID-19.", "Preventing the expansion of perihematomal edema (PHE) represents a novel strategy for the improvement of neurological outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients. Our goal was to predict early and delayed PHE expansion using a machine learning approach.\nWe enrolled 550 patients with spontaneous ICH to study early PHE expansion, and 389 patients to study delayed expansion. Two imaging researchers rated the shape and density of hematoma in non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT). We trained a radiological machine learning (ML) model, a radiomics ML model, and a combined ML model, using data from radiomics, traditional imaging, and clinical indicators. We then validated these models on an independent dataset by using a nested 4-fold cross-validation approach. We compared models with respect to their predictive performance, which was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve.\nFor both early and delayed PHE expansion, the combined ML model was most predictive (early/delayed AUC values were 0.840/0.705), followed by the radiomics ML model (0.799/0.663), the radiological ML model (0.779/0.631), and the imaging readers (reader 1: 0.668/0.565, reader 2: 0.700/0.617).\nWe validated a machine learning approach with high interpretability for the prediction of early and delayed PHE expansion. This new technique may assist clinical practice for the management of neurocritical patients with ICH.\n\u2022 This is the first study to use artificial intelligence technology for the prediction of perihematomal edema expansion. \u2022 A combined machine learning model, trained on data from radiomics, clinical indicators, and imaging features associated with hematoma expansion, outperformed all other methods.", "The purpose of this study was to compare long-term neurocognitive functioning (working memory, processing speed, and attention) between children who had been treated with either propranolol or atenolol for infantile hemangioma during infancy. All eligible children (n\u2009=\u2009158) aged 6\u00a0years or older and treated with propranolol or atenolol as infants were invited to participate in this two-center cross-sectional study. The primary outcome was the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-V Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI), a measure of working memory, processing speed, and attention. Secondary outcomes were general intelligence, auditory, visuospatial, and narrative memory, as well as executive functioning and sleep. A total of 105 children, of whom 36 had been treated with propranolol (age 6.0-11.8\u00a0years, follow-up time 1.6-9.7\u00a0years, 19% male) and 69 had been treated with atenolol (age 6.9-9.7\u00a0years, follow-up time 4.5-8.4\u00a0years, 19% male), were analyzed. The CPI and other neurocognitive outcomes did not differ between the propranolol and atenolol groups and were in line with general population test norms. Post hoc analyses revealed lower CPI scores for males, both compared to participating females (10.3 IQ points, medium effect size) and compared to matched test norms (12.4 IQ points, medium effect size).\nLong-term neurocognitive functioning did not differ between children treated with propranolol and those treated with atenolol for IH. Overall, propranolol and atenolol appear to be safe treatments for IH regarding long-term neurocognitive functioning. The substantially lower CPI scores in males warrant further investigation.\nNetherlands Trial Register, NL7703 https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7703 What is Known: \u2022\u00a0Infants with infantile hemangioma are effectively treated with propranolol or atenolol. \u2022\u00a0Parents and professionals are concerned about long-term neurocognitive effects.\n\u2022\u00a0No long-term (\u2265\u20096\u00a0years) differences in neurocognitive functioning were found between children treated with propranolol or atenolol. \u2022\u00a0Males treated with beta-blockers had substantially lower IQ scores than treated females and males from the general population, which is a matter of concern and should be considered when evaluating the risk/benefit ratio in less severe forms of infantile hemangioma.", "Epidemiological studies report high levels of anxiety and depression amongst adolescents. These psychiatric conditions and complex interplays of biological, social and environmental factors are important risk factors for suicidal behaviours and suicide, which show a peak in late adolescence and early adulthood. Although deaths by suicide have fallen globally in recent years, suicide deaths are increasing in some countries, such as the US. Suicide prevention is a challenging global public health problem. Currently, there aren't any validated clinical biomarkers for suicidal diagnosis, and traditional methods exhibit limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) is budding in many fields, including in the diagnosis of medical conditions. This review paper summarizes recent studies (past 8 years) that employed AI tools for the automated detection of depression and/or anxiety disorder and discusses the limitations and effects of some modalities. The studies assert that AI tools produce promising results and could overcome the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. Although using AI tools for suicidal ideation exhibits limitations, these are outweighed by the advantages. Thus, this review article also proposes extracting a fusion of features such as facial images, speech signals, and visual and clinical history features from deep models for the automated detection of depression and/or anxiety disorder in individuals, for future work. This may pave the way for the identification of individuals with suicidal thoughts.", "Vocalizations in animals, particularly birds, are critically important behaviors that influence their reproductive fitness. While recordings of bioacoustic data have been captured and stored in collections for decades, the automated extraction of data from these recordings has only recently been facilitated by artificial intelligence methods. These have yet to be evaluated with respect to accuracy of different automation strategies and features. Here, we use a recently published machine learning framework to extract syllables from ten bird species ranging in their phylogenetic relatedness from 1 to 85 million years, to compare how phylogenetic relatedness influences accuracy. We also evaluate the utility of applying trained models to novel species. Our results indicate that model performance is best on conspecifics, with accuracy progressively decreasing as phylogenetic distance increases between taxa. However, we also find that the application of models trained on multiple distantly related species can improve the overall accuracy to levels near that of training and analyzing a model on the same species. When planning big-data bioacoustics studies, care must be taken in sample design to maximize sample size and minimize human labor without sacrificing accuracy.", "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, many researchers have begun to focus on visual language navigation, which is one of the most important tasks in multi-modal machine learning. The focus of this multi-modal field is how to fuse multiple inputs, which is crucial for the integrated feedback of intrinsic information. However, the existing models are only implemented through simple data augmentation or expansion, and are obviously far from being able to tap the intrinsic relationship between modalities. In this paper, to overcome these challenges, a novel multi-modal matching feedback self-tuning model is proposed, which is a novel neural network called Vital Information Matching Feedback Self-tuning Network (VIM-Net). Our VIM-Net network is mainly composed of two matching feedback modules, a visual matching feedback module (V-mat) and a trajectory matching feedback module (T-mat). Specifically, V-mat matches the target information of visual recognition with the entity information extracted by the command; T-mat matches the serialized trajectory feature with the direction of movement of the command. Ablation experiments and comparative experiments are conducted on the proposed model using the Matterport3D simulator and the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark datasets, and the final navigation effect is shown in detail. The results prove that the model proposed in this paper is indeed effective on the task.", "With the number of older people living alone continuously rising, health-monitoring systems using information and communication technology (ICT) have been developed to manage their health issues. Life logging and human body communication sensor, types of ICT, have been adapted to manage and monitor health status of the elderly. However, its feasibility and efficacy remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the feasibility of TouchCare system which combined life logging with human body communication technology and its effect on the physical and psychological status of older adults living alone.\nThe TouchCare system, which consisted of a wearable watch, touchpad sensors, TouchCare application, and context-aware artificial intelligence, was developed by DNX Co. Ltd and used by the participants for 5\u2009months. Out of the 111 selected participants, 91 replied to the satisfaction survey, and 22 participated in further investigation regarding their physical and psychological status. Finally, health assessment from 14 participants and sensor data from 13 participants (mean age\u2009=\u200977.4; SD\u2009=\u20093.8) were analyzed to compare their health status and health-related behaviors before and after use of the system.\nOut of the 91 participants who took the survey, 51.6% were satisfied with the system. Nutritional status (pre-intervention (10.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0) vs. post-intervention (11.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9), P\u2009=\u20090.04) and fall efficacy (pre-intervention (89.2\u2009\u00b1\u200915.3) vs. post-intervention (99.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5), P\u2009=\u20090.001) significantly improved after use of the system. Chronic pain (pre-intervention (4.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5) vs. post-intervention (4.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7), P\u2009=\u20090.78) and depressive symptoms (pre-intervention (5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9) vs. post-intervention (5.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1), P\u2009=\u20090.60) reduced, while cognitive function (pre-intervention (4.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4) vs. post-intervention (4.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1), P\u2009=\u20090.15) and physical performance related to walking improved (pre-intervention (3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2) vs. post-intervention (4.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090), P\u2009=\u20090.35), but were not significant. Behaviors related to physical activity and gait improved after use of the system; touch counts of refrigerator and microwave also increased with a decrease in night touch counts.\nThe TouchCare system was acceptable to older people living alone, and it efficiently managed their daily living while promoting their health-related behaviors. Further experimental studies are required to verify the effectiveness of the system, and to develop the system which meet the individualized needs of older people living alone.", "Cancer is one of the most devastating, fatal, dangerous, and unpredictable ailments. To reduce the risk of fatality in this disease, we need some ways to predict the disease,\u00a0diagnose it faster and precisely,\u00a0and\u00a0predict the prognosis accurately. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms into the healthcare system has already proven to work wonders for\u00a0patients. Artificial intelligence is a simulation of intelligence that uses data, rules, and information programmed in it to make predictions. The science of machine learning (ML) uses data to enhance performance in a variety of activities and tasks. A bigger family of machine learning techniques built on artificial neural networks and representation learning is deep learning (DL).\u00a0To clarify, we require AI, ML, and DL to predict cancer risk, survival chances, cancer recurrence, cancer diagnosis, and cancer prognosis. All of these are required to improve patient's quality of life, increase their survival rates, decrease anxiety and fear to some extent, and make a proper personalized treatment plan for the suffering patient. The survival rates of people with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can be forecasted.\u00a0Both solid and non-solid tumors can be diagnosed precisely with the help of AI and ML algorithms. The prognosis of the disease can also be forecasted with AI and its approaches like deep learning. This improvement in cancer care is a turning point in advanced healthcare and will deeply impact patient's life for good.", "Although studies used machine learning algorithms to predict performances in sports activities, none, to the best of our knowledge, have used and validated two artificial intelligence techniques: artificial neural network (ANN) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) in the running discipline of marathon and compared the accuracy or precision of the predicted performances. Official French rankings for the 10-km road and marathon events in 2019 were scrutinized over a dataset of 820 athletes (aged 21, having run 10\u2009km and a marathon in the same year that was run slower, etc.). For the KNN and ANN the same inputs (10-km race time, body mass index, age and sex) were used to solve a linear regression problem to estimate the marathon race time. No difference was found between the actual and predicted marathon performances for either method (p>0,05). All predicted performances were significantly correlated with the actual ones, with very high correlation coefficients (r>0,90; p<0,001). KNN outperformed ANN with a mean absolute error of 2,4 vs 5,6%. The study confirms the validity of both algorithms, with better accuracy for KNN in predicting marathon performance. Consequently, the predictions from these artificial intelligence methods may be used in training programs and competitions.", "This study introduces a new method to measure high refractive index (RI) materials with irregular shapes based on optical coherent tomography (OCT) images. Since the optical path length is the critical parameter to calculate RI, image fusion, thresholding, boundary extraction, and Hough transform were adopted in a well-organized sequence to extract this parameter when analyzing OCT images. Hough transform plays a key role in target recognition and parameter extraction. Glass and diamond were used as samples to test the validity of this method. The measurement result has reasonable consistency with the standard value. The method introduced in this paper has the potential to raise the automation and intelligence level of the existing research. A bright application prospect can be expected in industrial fields, such as optical glass, jewelry, and mineral substance.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has huge scope in developing models to predict the survival rate of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The availability of electronic clinical data has led to the widespread use of various machine learning approaches in this field. Innovative algorithms play a crucial role in boosting the performance of models. This study uses a stacked ensemble model to predict mortality in ICU by incorporating the clinical severity scoring results, in which several machine learning algorithms are employed to compare the performance. The experimental results show that the stacked ensemble model achieves good performance compared with the model without integrating the severity scoring results, which has the area under curve (AUC) of 0.879 and 0.862, respectively. To improve the performance of prediction, two feature subsets are obtained based on different feature selection techniques, labeled as SetS and SetT. Evaluation performances show that the SEM based on the SetS achieves a higher AUC value (0.879 and 0.860). Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is employed to interpret the correlation between the risk features and the outcome.", "Segmentation of brain tumours is a complex problem in medical image processing and analysis. It is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Therefore, computer-aided detection systems need to be developed to decrease physicians' workload and improve the accuracy of segmentation.\nThis paper proposes a level set method constrained by an intuitive artificial intelligence-based approach to perform brain tumour segmentation. By studying 3D brain tumour images, a new segmentation technique based on the Modified Particle Swarm Optimisation (MPSO), Darwin Particle Swarm Optimisation (DPSO), and Fractional Order Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimisation (FODPSO) algorithms were developed.\nThe introduced technique was verified according to the MICCAI RASTS 2013 database for high-grade glioma patients. The three algorithms were evaluated using different performance measures: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Dice similarity coefficient to prove the performance and robustness of our 3D segmentation technique.\nThe result is that the MPSO algorithm consistently outperforms the DPSO and FO DPSO.", "The utilization of unlabeled electrocardiogram (ECG) data is always a critical topic in artificial intelligence healthcare, as the manual annotation for ECG data is a time-consuming task that requires much medical expertise. The recent development of self-supervised learning, especially contrastive learning, has provided helpful inspirations to solve this problem. In this paper, a joint cross-dimensional contrastive learning algorithm for unlabeled 12-lead ECGs is proposed. Unlike existing studies about ECG contrastive learning, our algorithm can simultaneously exploit unlabeled 1-dimensional ECG signals and 2-dimensional ECG images. A cross-dimensional contrastive learning method enhances the interaction between 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional ECG data, resulting in a more effective self-supervised feature learning. Combining this cross-dimensional contrastive learning, a 1-dimensional contrastive learning with ECG-specific transformations is employed to constitute a joint model. To pre-train this joint model, a new hybrid contrastive loss balances the 2 algorithms and uniformly describes the pre-training target. In the downstream classification task, the features learned by our algorithm shows impressive advantages. Compared with other representative methods, it achieves a at least 5.99% increase in accuracy. For real-world applications, an efficient heterogenous deployment on a \"system-on-a-chip\" (SoC) is designed. According to our experiments, the model can process 12-lead ECGs in real-time on the SoC. Furthermore, this heterogenous deployment can achieve a 14\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0faster inference than the pure software deployment on the same SoC. In summary, our algorithm is a good choice for unlabeled 12-lead ECG utilization, the proposed heterogenous deployment makes it more practical in real-world applications.", "Intellectual disability (ID) is a major developmental disability. However, data on changes in the prevalence over time at the national level are limited.\nUsing data from the national disability registry, we conducted an ecological study to evaluate the time trends of ID among children in Taiwan. We calculated the prevalence of ID by age, sex and severity, from 2000 to 2011, and assessed the time trends.\nDuring the study period, the overall prevalence of ID in children aged 3-17\u00a0years increased from 3.60 to 5.91 per 1000 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.22, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, r2 \u00a0=\u00a00.97). The prevalence of mild ID (MID, intelligence quotient: 50-69) increased from 1.30 to 3.60 per 1000 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.21, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, r2 \u00a0=\u00a00.98). However, the prevalence of severe ID (SID, intelligence quotient: <50) was relatively constant, between 2.22 and 2.38 per 1000 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.01, P\u00a0=\u00a00.076, r2 \u00a0=\u00a00.96). Boys had a higher prevalence than girls, and the average boy-to-girl prevalence ratio was 1.42 for MID and 1.31 for SID. The boy-to-girl prevalence ratios of MID and SID decreased over time (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.01, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, r2 \u00a0=\u00a00.99 for MID; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.01, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, r2 \u00a0=\u00a01.00 for SID).\nThe prevalence of ID in Taiwanese children increased from 2000 to 2011 and was largely attributable to increases in MID. Boys had a higher prevalence of ID and were more likely to have MID.", "Video laryngoscopy is an important diagnostic tool for head and neck cancers. The artificial intelligence (AI) system has been shown to monitor blind spots during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. This study aimed to test the performance of AI-driven intelligent laryngoscopy monitoring assistant (ILMA) for landmark anatomical sites identification on laryngoscopic images and videos based on a convolutional neural network (CNN).\nThe laryngoscopic images taken from January to December 2018 were retrospectively collected, and ILMA was developed using the CNN model of Inception-ResNet-v2\u00a0+\u00a0Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet). A total of 16,000 laryngoscopic images were used for training. These were assigned to 20 landmark anatomical sites covering six major head and neck regions. In addition, the performance of ILMA in identifying anatomical sites was validated using 4000 laryngoscopic images and 25 videos provided by five other tertiary hospitals.\nILMA identified the 20 anatomical sites on the laryngoscopic images with a total accuracy of 97.60\u00a0%, and the average sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 100\u00a0%, 99.87\u00a0%, 97.65\u00a0%, and 99.87\u00a0%, respectively. In addition, multicenter clinical verification displayed that the accuracy of ILMA in identifying the 20 targeted anatomical sites in 25 laryngoscopic videos from five hospitals was \u226595\u00a0%.\nThe proposed CNN-based ILMA model can rapidly and accurately identify the anatomical sites on laryngoscopic images.

Moyamoya has been associated with a range of neuropsychological deficits in adults, but data on many cognitive domains remain limited in the pediatric population and little is known about the neuropsychological profile of children with syndromic moyamoya.\nThis is a single-center, retrospective cohort study of children with moyamoya arteriopathy followed at our center who underwent neuropsychological testing between 2003 and 2021. Test scores were extracted from neuropsychological reports. Medical records were reviewed with attention to individual neuropsychological test results, medical comorbidities, presence of infarct(s) on neuroimaging, and history of clinical ischemic stroke.\nOf the 83 children with moyamoya followed at our center between 2003 and 2021, 13 had completed neuropsychological testing across multiple cognitive domains. Compared to age-based normative data, children in this sample had lower scores in overall intelligence (p\u2009=\u20090.003), global executive functioning (p\u2009=\u20090.005), and overall adaptive functioning (p\u2009=\u20090.015). There was no significant difference in overall intelligence between children with (n\u2009=\u20096) versus without (n\u2009=\u20097) a history of clinical stroke (p\u2009=\u20090.368), though children with any radiographic infarct scored lower in this domain (p\u2009=\u20090.032).\nIn our cohort, children with moyamoya demonstrated impaired intelligence and executive functioning, even in the absence of clinical stroke. Neuropsychological evaluation should be considered standard of care for all children with moyamoya, even those without a history of clinical stroke.", "Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI), characterized by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has become an indispensable tool in obesity research.\nThis scoping review aimed to provide researchers and practitioners with an overview of the AI applications to obesity research, familiarize them with popular ML and DL models, and facilitate the adoption of AI applications.\nWe conducted a scoping review in PubMed and Web of Science on the applications of AI to measure, predict, and treat obesity. We summarized and categorized the AI methodologies used in the hope of identifying synergies, patterns, and trends to inform future investigations. We also provided a high-level, beginner-friendly introduction to the core methodologies to facilitate the dissemination and adoption of various AI techniques.\nWe identified 46 studies that used diverse ML and DL models to assess obesity-related outcomes. The studies found AI models helpful in detecting clinically meaningful patterns of obesity or relationships between specific covariates and weight outcomes. The majority (18/22, 82%) of the studies comparing AI models with conventional statistical approaches found that the AI models achieved higher prediction accuracy on test data. Some (5/46, 11%) of the studies comparing the performances of different AI models revealed mixed results, indicating the high contingency of model performance on the data set and task it was applied to. An accelerating trend of adopting state-of-the-art DL models over standard ML models was observed to address challenging computer vision and natural language processing tasks. We concisely introduced the popular ML and DL models and summarized their specific applications in the studies included in the review.\nThis study reviewed AI-related methodologies adopted in the obesity literature, particularly ML and DL models applied to tabular, image, and text data. The review also discussed emerging trends such as multimodal or multitask AI models, synthetic data generation, and human-in-the-loop that may witness increasing applications in obesity research.", "The newly-emerged pathological conditions and increased rates of drug resistance necessitate application of the state-of-the-art technologies for accelerated discovery of the therapeutic candidates and obtaining comprehensive knowledge about their targets, action mechanisms, and interactions within the body including those between the receptors and drugs.

Besides the artificial intelligence- and quantum-based techniques, crystal engineering capable of designing new molecules with appropriate characteristics, improving the stability and bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs, and efficient carrier development could play a crucial role in manufacturing efficient pharmaceuticals and reducing the adverse events. In this context, identifying the structures and behaviors of crystals and predicting their characteristics are of great value. Electron diffraction by accelerated analysis of the chemicals and sensitivity to charge alterations, electromechanical tools for controlled delivery of therapeutics, mechatronics via fabrication of multi-functional smart products including the organ-on-chip devices for healthcare applications, and optomechatronics by overcoming the limitations of conventional biomedical techniques could address the unmet biomedical requirements and facilitate development of more effective theranostics with improved outcomes.", "CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) show great potential in various applications due to their size-dependent and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, it is still challenging to synthesize size-tunable CsPbBr3 QDs with purple emission. Herein, CsPbBr3 nanospheres (NS) with purple emission (432 nm) and wavelength-tunable photoluminescence were synthesized using a two-step recrystallization method for the first time. A nanocube (NC) strategy resulting from CsPbBr3 nanosphere self-assembly via polar solvent-induced surface ligand mismatch was proposed. The self-assembly process endows the QDs with wavelength-tunable photoluminescence ranging from 432 to 518 nm. The significant reduction in defects during self-assembly was confirmed by transient optical spectroscopy measurements, photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), and the disappearance of tail bands in the long-wavelength region of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. This theory demonstrated that the decrease in high defect surfaces and increase in specific surface area were the reasons for the decline in defects. Most importantly, these QDs could be used for the active jamming of optical imaging systems based on charged-coupled devices (CCDs), including laser imaging radar and low light level (LLL) night vision systems. QDs significantly increase the mean square error (MSE) of the image, while the detection rate of the target by the artificial intelligence algorithm decreased by 95.17%. The wide wavelength tunable emission caused by structural changes makes it arduous for silicon-based detectors to avoid the interference of QDs by adding filters or by other means.", "To precisely predict prostate cancer (PCa) risk stratification, we constructed a machine learning (ML) model based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomic features.\nBetween August 2016 and May 2021, patients with histologically proven PCa who underwent pre-operative MRI and prostate-specific antigen screening were included. The patients were grouped into different risk categories as defined by the European Association of Urology-European Association of Nuclear Medicine-European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology-European Society of Urogenital Radiology-International Society of Geriatric Oncology guidelines. Using Artificial Intelligence Kit software, PCa regions of interest were delineated and radiomic features were extracted. Subsequently, predictable models were built by utilising five traditional ML approaches: support vector machine, logistic regression, gradient boosting decision tree, k-nearest neighbour and random forest (RF) classifiers. The classification capacity of the developed models was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis.\nA total of 213 patients were enrolled, including 16 low-risk, 65 intermediate-risk, and 132 high-risk PCa patients. The risk stratification of PCa could be revealed by MRI radiomic features, and second-order features accounted for most of the selected features. Among the five established ML models, the RF model showed the best overall predictive performance (AUC = 0.87). After further analysis of the subgroups based on the RF model, the prediction of the high-risk group was the best (AUC = 0.89).\nThis study demonstrated that the MR radiomics-based ML method could be a promising tool for predicting PCa risk stratification precisely.\nThe ML models have valuable prospect for accurate PCa risk assessment, which might contribute to customize treatment and surveillance strategies.", "Diagnostic reasoning is a foundational ability of health professionals. The goal of enhancing clinical reasoning education is improved diagnostic accuracy and reduced diagnostic error. In order to do so, health professions educators need not only help learners improve their clinical reasoning, but teach them how to develop expert performance. An evidence-based learning strategy that is strongly associated with expert performance is self-regulated learning (SRL). SRL is the modulation of \"self-generated thoughts, feelings, and actions that are planned and cyclically adapted to the attainment of personal goals\". At this time, there is little data on the use of SRL to improve diagnostic reasoning. However, there appear to be numerous opportunities to utilize SRL in novel ways to improve diagnostic reasoning given what is already known about this competency. Examples that are discussed include the role SRL can play in simulation, clinical experiences, assessment, and novel technologies such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. SRL is central to the philosophy that health professionals are life-long learners, as it teaches learners \"how to learn\". SRL has the potential to help achieve the goal of improved diagnostic accuracy and reduced diagnostic error.", "Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has witnessed significant growth over the last twenty-five years, providing a wide range of technologies to support academic, institutional, and administrative services. More recently, AIED applications have been developed to prepare students for the workforce, providing career guidance services for higher education. However, this remains challenging, especially concerning the rapidly changing labour market in the IT sector. In this paper, we introduce an AI-based solution named C3-IoC (https://c3-ioc.co.uk), which intends to help students explore career paths in IT according to their level of education, skills and prior experience. The C3-IoC presents a novel similarity metric method for relating existing job roles to a range of technical and non-technical skills. This also allows the visualisation of a job role network, placing the student within communities of job roles. Using a unique knowledge base, user skill profiling, job role matching, and visualisation modules, the C3-IoC supports students in self-evaluating their skills and understanding how they relate to emerging IT jobs.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40593-022-00317-y.", "Intraoral photographic images are helpful in the clinical diagnosis of caries. Moreover, the application of artificial intelligence to these images has been attempted consistently. This study aimed to evaluate a deep learning algorithm for caries detection through the segmentation of the tooth surface using these images.\nIn this prospective study, 2348 in-house intraoral photographic images were collected from 445 participants using a professional intraoral camera at a dental clinic in a university medical centre from October 2020 to December 2021. Images were randomly assigned to training (1638), validation (410), and test (300) datasets. For image segmentation of the tooth surface, classification, and localisation of caries, convolutional neural networks (CNN), namely U-Net, ResNet-18, and Faster R-CNN, were applied.\nFor the classification algorithm for caries images, the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were improved to 0.813 and 0.837 from 0.758 to 0.731, respectively, through segmentation of the tooth surface using CNN. Localisation algorithm for carious lesions after segmentation of the tooth area also showed improved performance. For example, sensitivity and average precision improved from 0.890 to 0.889 to 0.865 and 0.868, respectively.\nThe deep learning model with segmentation of the tooth surface is promising for caries detection on photographic images from an intraoral camera. This may be an aided diagnostic method for caries with the advantages of being time and cost-saving.", "Advanced technologies in intensive care units, including artificial intelligence and digitization, has implications for psycho-emotional aspects of caring in terms of communication, involvement, and holistic provision in a safe, effective, and efficient manner. Critical care nurses must maintain a balance between their technological and humanistic caring behaviours during the provision of individualized holistic patient care. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine level and predictors of caring behaviours among critical care nurses in two Arab countries.\nA cross-sectional design was used to achieve the objective of this study, whereby a quantitative online questionnaire survey was administered to 210 adult intensive care unit nurses at two government hospitals in Sharjah (United Arab Emirates), and two university hospitals in Amman (Jordan). Based on G* Power analysis, 200 participants were adequate to run the analysis.\nOn average, 49% of the whole sample had 'good' caring behaviours. Among nurses who were working in Emirati intensive care units, 48.5% had good caring behaviours, compared to 47.4% of Jordanian intensive care unit nurses. Additionally, the results showed that predictors of caring behaviours among nurses include female gender, holding a master's degree, interest in nursing profession, and a 1:1 nurse-to-patient ratio.\nAbout half of the ICU nurses in this study had low levels of caring behaviours. The present study highlights the requirement for integrating the concept of holistic and patient-centred care as the essence of the nursing profession in nursing curricula to improve the level of care provided by all nurses working in intensive care units. Continuing education programs and specific interventional programs should be directed toward predictors of caring behaviours among each specific group of nurses. Future research is needed using qualitative methods to understand what the perception of intensive care unit nurses is about caring.", "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common lung disease of extreme prematurity, yet mechanisms that associate with or identify neonates with increased susceptibility for BPD are largely unknown. Combining artificial intelligence with gene expression data is a novel approach that may assist in better understanding mechanisms underpinning chronic lung disease and in stratifying patients at greater risk for BPD. The objective of this study is to develop an early peripheral blood transcriptomic signature that can predict preterm neonates at risk for developing BPD. Secondary analysis of whole blood microarray data from 97 very low birth weight neonates on day of life 5 was performed. BPD was defined as positive pressure ventilation or oxygen requirement at 28 days of age. Participants were randomly assigned to a training (70%) and testing cohort (30%). Four gene-centric machine learning models were built, and their discriminatory abilities were compared with gestational age or birth weight. This study adheres to the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement. Neonates with BPD (n = 62 subjects) exhibited a lower median gestational age (26.0 wk vs. 30.0 wk, P < 0.01) and birth weight (800 g vs. 1,280 g, P < 0.01) compared with non-BPD neonates. From an initial pool (33,252 genes/patient), 4,523 genes exhibited a false discovery rate (FDR) <1%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting BPD utilizing gestational age or birth weight was 87.8% and 87.2%, respectively. The machine learning models, using a combination of five genes, revealed AUCs ranging between 85.8% and 96.1%. Pathways integral to T cell development and differentiation were associated with BPD. A derived five-gene whole blood signature can accurately predict BPD in the first week of life.", "Does embryo categorization by existing artificial intelligence (AI), morphokinetic or morphological embryo selection models correlate with blastocyst euploidy?\nA total of 834 patients (mean maternal age 40.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4 years) who underwent preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A) on a total of 3573 tested blastocysts were included in this retrospective study. The cycles were stratified into five maternal age groups according to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology age groups (<35, 35-37, 38-40, 41-42 and >42 years). The main outcome of this study was the correlation of euploidy rates in stratified maternal age groups and an automated AI model (iDAScore\u00ae v1.0), a morphokinetic embryo selection model (KIDScore Day 5 ver 3, KS-D5) and a traditional morphological grading model (Gardner criteria), respectively.\nEuploidy rates were significantly correlated with iDAScore (P\u202f=\u202f0.0035 to <0.001) in all age groups, and expect for the youngest age group, with KS-D5 and Gardner criteria (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that for all models, higher scores were significantly correlated with euploidy (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).\nThese results show that existing blastocyst scoring models correlate with ploidy status. However, as these models were developed to indicate implantation potential, they cannot accurately diagnose if an embryo is euploid or aneuploid. Instead, they may be used to support the decision of how many and which blastocysts to biopsy, thus potentially reducing patient costs.", "Having started since late 2019, COVID-19 has spread through far many nations around the globe. Not being known profoundly, the novel virus of the Coronaviruses family has already caused more than half a million deaths and put the lives of many more people in danger. Policymakers have implemented preventive measures to curb the outbreak of the virus, and health practitioners along with epidemiologists have pointed out many social and hygienic factors associated with the virus incidence and mortality. However, a clearer vision of how the various factors cited hitherto can affect total death in different communities is yet to be analyzed. This study has put this issue forward. Applying artificial intelligence techniques, the relationship between COVID-19 death toll and determinants mentioned as strongly influential in earlier studies was investigated. In the first stage, employing Best-Worst Method, the weight of the primer contributing factor, effectiveness of strategies, was estimated. Then, using an integrated Best-Worst Method-local linear neuro-fuzzy-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system approach, the relationship between COVID-19 mortality rate and all factors namely effectiveness of strategies, age pyramid, health system status, and community health status was elucidated more specifically.", "In recent years, the field of psychology has received more attention from researchers that work in the area of translation studies. This review set out to delve into the role of translation students' critical thinking, as a construct of cognitive psychology, and emotion regulation, as a positive psychological construct, in translation performance. The positive and significant relationship between translation students' critical thinking skill and their translation performance has been verified in the literature. Moreover, studies have revealed that emotion regulation and its regulator components, such as emotional intelligence, intuition, resilience, and professional expertise can significantly influence translation performance. This review can be beneficial for translation trainees, translation trainers, and curriculum designers to raise their awareness about the role of critical thinking and emotion regulation in translation studies.", "Despite technological and medical advances, the detection, interpretation, and treatment of cancer based on imaging data continue to pose significant challenges. These include inter-observer variability, class imbalance, dataset shifts, inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity, malignancy determination, and treatment effect uncertainty. Given the recent advancements in image synthesis, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and adversarial training, we assess the potential of these technologies to address a number of key challenges of cancer imaging. We categorise these challenges into (a) data scarcity and imbalance, (b) data access and privacy, (c) data annotation and segmentation, (d) cancer detection and diagnosis, and (e) tumour profiling, treatment planning and monitoring. Based on our analysis of 164 publications that apply adversarial training techniques in the context of cancer imaging, we highlight multiple underexplored solutions with research potential. We further contribute the Synthesis Study Trustworthiness Test (SynTRUST), a meta-analysis framework for assessing the validation rigour of medical image synthesis studies. SynTRUST is based on 26 concrete measures of thoroughness, reproducibility, usefulness, scalability, and tenability. Based on SynTRUST, we analyse 16 of the most promising cancer imaging challenge solutions and observe a high validation rigour in general, but also several desirable improvements. With this work, we strive to bridge the gap between the needs of the clinical cancer imaging community and the current and prospective research on data synthesis and adversarial networks in the artificial intelligence community.", "Personalized medicine refers to the tailoring of diagnostics and therapeutics to individuals based on one's biological, social, and behavioral characteristics. While personalized dental medicine is still far from being a reality, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with improved data analytic approaches are expected to integrate diverse data from the individual, setting, and system levels, which may facilitate a deeper understanding of the interaction of these multilevel data and therefore bring us closer to more personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry, also known as P4 dentistry. In the field of dentomaxillofacial imaging, a wide range of AI applications, including several commercially available software options, have been proposed to assist dentists in the diagnosis and treatment planning of various dentomaxillofacial diseases, with performance similar or even superior to that of specialists. Notably, the impact of these dental AI applications on treatment decision, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, and cost-effectiveness has so far been assessed sparsely. Such information should be further investigated in future studies to provide patients, providers, and healthcare organizers a clearer picture of the true usefulness of AI in daily dental practice.", "Recent years have seen increased interests in applying the latest technological innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to the field of education. One of the main areas of interest to researchers is the use of ML to assist teachers in assessing students' work on the one hand and to promote effective self-tutoring on the other hand. In this paper, we present a survey of the latest ML approaches to the automated evaluation of students' natural language free-text, including both short answers to questions and full essays. Existing systematic literature reviews on the subject often emphasise an exhaustive and methodical study selection process and do not provide much detail on individual studies or a technical background to the task. In contrast, we present an accessible survey of the current state-of-the-art in student free-text evaluation and target a wider audience that is not necessarily familiar with the task or with ML-based text analysis in natural language processing (NLP). We motivate and contextualise the task from an application perspective, illustrate popular feature-based and neural model architectures and present a selection of the latest work in the area. We also remark on trends and challenges in the field.", "Several studies have shown that personality traits are a benchmark in research field of bullying prevention, while others have highlighted that the socio-emotional skills are important to prevent a wide range of maladjusted behaviors, suggesting that the investment in their developing may mediate the effects of personality dispositions. The present study aims to clarify if socio-emotional attitudes can mediate the relationships between personality traits and bullying.\nFive sequential mediation models are tested using the Big Five personality traits as focal predictors, bullying as the outcome, and trait emotional intelligence and empathy as causally chained mediators, involving 199 primary school children (8-10 years) through the Bullying Prevalence Questionnaire, the Big Five Questionnaire for children, the Emotional Intelligence Index and the Empathy-Teen Conflict Survey.\nData showed that openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness were inversely related to bullying, and that the causal chain of TEI-empathy negatively and completely mediated the relationship between emotional instability and bullying and negatively and partially mediated the relationship between openness and bullying.\nThese results suggest that TEI and empathy mediate the relationship between personality traits and bullying, reducing the risk of being involved in bullying perpetration.", "Human-like tactile perception is critical for promoting robotic intelligence. However, reproducing tangential \"sliding\" perception of human skin is still struggling. Inspired by the lateral gating mechanosensing mechanism of mechanosensory cells, which perceives mechanical stimuli by lateral tension-induced opening-closing of ion channels, we report a robot skin (R-skin) with mechanically gated electron channels, achieving ultrasensitive and fast-response sliding tactile perception via pyramidal artificial fingerprint-triggered opening-closing of electron gates (E-gates, namely, customized V-shaped cracks within embedded mesh electron channels). By imitating cytomembrane to modulate membrane mechanics, local strain is enhanced at E-gates to effectively regulate electron pathways for high sensitivity while weakened at other positions to suppress random cracks for robust stability. The R-skin can directly recognize ultrafine surface microstructure (5 \u03bcm) at a response frequency (485 Hz) outshining humans and achieve human-like sliding perception functions, including dexterously distinguishing texture of complex-shaped objects and providing real-time feedback for grasping.", "Over 20% of US adults report they experience pain on most days or every day. Uncontrolled pain has led to increased healthcare utilization, hospitalization, emergency visits, and financial burden. Recognizing, assessing, understanding, and treating pain using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches may improve patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. A comprehensive synthesis of the current use and outcomes of AI-based interventions focused on pain assessment and management will guide the development of future research.\nThis review aims to investigate the state of the research on AI-based interventions designed to improve pain assessment and management for adult patients. We also ascertain the actual outcomes of Al-based interventions for adult patients.\nThe electronic databases searched include Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. The search initially identified 6946 studies. After screening, 30 studies met the inclusion criteria. The Critical Appraisals Skills Programme was used to assess study quality.\nThis review provides evidence that machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing were used to improve efficient pain recognition and pain assessment, analyze self-reported pain data, predict pain, and help clinicians and patients to manage chronic pain more effectively.\nFindings from this review suggest that using AI-based interventions has a positive effect on pain recognition, pain prediction, and pain self-management; however, most reports are only pilot studies. More pilot studies with physiological pain measures are required before these approaches are ready for large clinical trial.", "Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) provides significantly enhanced Raman scattering signals from molecules adsorbed on plasmonic nanostructures, as well as the molecules' vibrational fingerprints. Plasmonic nanoparticle systems are particularly powerful for SERS substrates as they provide a wide range of structural features and plasmonic couplings to boost the enhancement, often up to >108-1010. Nevertheless, nanoparticle-based SERS is not widely utilized as a means for reliable quantitative measurement of molecules largely due to limited controllability, uniformity, and scalability of plasmonic nanoparticles, poor molecular modification chemistry, and a lack of widely used analytical protocols for SERS. Furthermore, multiscale issues with plasmonic nanoparticle systems that range from atomic and molecular scales to assembled nanostructure scale are difficult to simultaneously control, analyze, and address. In this perspective, we introduce and discuss the design principles and key issues in preparing SERS nanoparticle substrates and the recent studies on the uniform and controllable synthesis and newly emerging machine learning-based analysis of plasmonic nanoparticle systems for quantitative SERS. Specifically, the multiscale point of view with plasmonic nanoparticle systems toward quantitative SERS is provided throughout this perspective. Furthermore, issues with correctly estimating and comparing SERS enhancement factors are discussed, and newly emerging statistical and artificial intelligence approaches for analyzing complex SERS systems are introduced and scrutinized to address challenges that cannot be fully resolved through synthetic improvements.", "Artificial intelligence in veterinary medicine is an emerging field. Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, allows computer programs to analyze large imaging datasets and learn to perform tasks relevant to veterinary diagnostic imaging. This review summarizes the small, yet growing body of artificial intelligence literature in veterinary imaging, provides necessary background to understand these papers, and provides author commentary on the state of the field. To date, less than 40 peer-reviewed publications have utilized machine learning to perform imaging-associated tasks across multiple anatomic regions in veterinary clinical and biomedical research. Major challenges in this field include collection and cleaning of sufficient image data, selection of high-quality ground truth labels, formation of relationships between veterinary and machine learning professionals, and closure of the gap between academic uses of artificial intelligence and currently available commercial products. Further development of artificial intelligence has the potential to help meet the growing need for radiological services through applications in workflow, quality control, and image interpretation for both general practitioners and radiologists.", "Orbital and eyelid disorders affect normal visual functions and facial appearance, and precise oculoplastic and reconstructive surgeries are crucial. Artificial intelligence (AI) network models exhibit a remarkable ability to analyze large sets of medical images to locate lesions. Currently, AI-based technology can automatically diagnose and grade orbital and eyelid diseases, such as thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), as well as measure eyelid morphological parameters based on external ocular photographs to assist surgical strategies. The various types of imaging data for orbital and eyelid diseases provide a large amount of training data for network models, which might be the next breakthrough in AI-related research. This paper retrospectively summarizes different imaging data aspects addressed in AI-related research on orbital and eyelid diseases, and discusses the advantages and limitations of this research field.", "Psychology and neuroscience have contributed significantly to advances in understanding compassion. In contrast, little attention has been given to the epidemiology of compassion. The human experience of compassion is heterogeneous with respect to time, place, and person. Therefore, compassion has an epidemiology, although little is known about the factors that account for spatial or temporal clustering of compassion or how these factors might be harnessed to promote and realize a more compassionate world. We reviewed the scientific literature to describe what is known about \"risk factors\" for compassion towards others. Studies were included if they used quantitative methods, treated compassion as an outcome, and used measures of compassion that included elements of empathy and action to alleviate suffering. Eighty-two studies met the inclusion criteria; 89 potential risk factors were tested 418 times for association with compassion. Significant associations with compassion were found for individual demographic factors (e.g., gender, religious faith); personal characteristics (e.g., emotional intelligence, perspective-taking, secure attachment); personal experience (e.g., previous adversity); behaviors (e.g., church attendance); circumstantial factors during the compassion encounter (e.g., perceptions of suffering severity, relational proximity of the compassion-giver and -receiver, emotional state of the compassion-giver); and organizational features. Few studies explored the capacity to receive, rather than give, compassion. Definitions and measures of compassion varied widely across disciplines; 87% of studies used self-report measures and 39% used a cross-sectional design. Ten randomized clinical trials documented the effectiveness of compassion training. From an epidemiologic perspective, most studies treated compassion as an individual host factor rather than as transmissible or influenced by time or the environment. The causal pathways leading from suffering to a compassionate response appear to be non-linear and complex. A variety of factors (acting as effect modifiers) appear to be permissive of-or essential for-the arising of compassion in certain settings or specific populations. Future epidemiologic research on compassion should take into account contextual and environmental factors and should elucidate compassion-related dynamics within organizations and human systems. Such research should be informed by a range of epidemiologic tools and methods, as well as insights from other scientific disciplines and spiritual and religious traditions.", "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with high mortality. Accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions for GC rely heavily on human experts' careful judgments on medical images. However, the improvement of the accuracy is hindered by imaging conditions, limited experience, objective criteria, and inter-observer discrepancies. Recently, the developments of machine learning, especially deep-learning algorithms, have been facilitating computers to extract more information from data automatically. Researchers are exploring the far-reaching applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in various clinical practices, including GC. Herein, we aim to provide a broad framework to summarize current research on AI in GC. In the screening of GC, AI can identify precancerous diseases and assist in early cancer detection with endoscopic examination and pathological confirmation. In the diagnosis of GC, AI can support tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging and subtype classification. For treatment decisions, AI can help with surgical margin determination and prognosis prediction. Meanwhile, current approaches are challenged by data scarcity and poor interpretability. To tackle these problems, more regulated data, unified processing procedures, and advanced algorithms are urgently needed to build more accurate and robust AI models for GC.", "Building accurate and robust artificial intelligence systems for medical image assessment requires the creation of large sets of annotated training examples. However, constructing such datasets is very costly due to the complex nature of annotation tasks, which often require expert knowledge (e.g., a radiologist). To counter this limitation, we propose a method to learn from medical images at scale in a self-supervised way.\nOur approach, based on contrastive learning and online feature clustering, leverages training datasets of over 100,000,000 medical images of various modalities, including radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and ultrasonography (US). We propose to use the learned features to guide model training in supervised and hybrid self-supervised/supervised regime on various downstream tasks.\nWe highlight a number of advantages of this strategy on challenging image assessment problems in radiography, CT, and MR: (1)\u00a0significant increase in accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art (e.g., area under the curve boost of 3% to 7% for detection of abnormalities from chest radiography scans and hemorrhage detection on brain CT); (2)\u00a0acceleration of model convergence during training by up to 85% compared with using no pretraining (e.g., 83% when training a model for detection of brain metastases in MR scans); and (3)\u00a0increase in robustness to various image augmentations, such as intensity variations, rotations or scaling reflective of data variation seen in the field.\nThe proposed approach enables large gains in accuracy and robustness on challenging image assessment problems. The improvement is significant compared with other state-of-the-art approaches trained on medical or vision images (e.g., ImageNet).", "Human society cannot afford the luxury of the business-as-usual approach when dealing with the emerging challenges of the 21st century. The challenges of food production to meet the pace of population growth in an environmentally-sustainable manner have increased considerably, emphasizing the need to explore newer approaches to agriculture. Agrochemical-based agricultural practices are known to have serious environmental and health implications. Even conventional organic farming is not sustainable in the long run. Although some \"age-old\" practices are useful, these will not help feed more people on the same or less land more sustainably. Sustainable intensification is the way forward. There is a need to incorporate a customer-centric outlook and make the organic system sustainable. Here, we bring forth the necessity to enhance the efficiency of organic agriculture by the inclusion of robotics and agrochemical-free GM seeds. Such an organic-GM hybrid agriculture system integrated with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) based technologies will have better energy efficiency. The produce from such a system will offer consumers a 'third' choice and create a new food label, 'organically-grown GM produce'.", "Digital transformation affects all organizations, large and small. Waves of technological change are frequent and accelerating, requiring constant adaptation by companies and their employees. Artificial intelligence, automation, and digital tools are changing the traditional organizational structure and ways of working. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the labor market has to move toward an inclusive digital transformation that braces the business systems. This paper is an attempt to explore the effect of digitalization on employment in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and compare them to some selected advanced countries. The methodology focuses on the second-generation unit root tests and the Auto Regressive Distributed Lagged model for the period 2000-2020. The findings show a negative and significant impact of ICT on employment in the industrial and services sectors for GCC countries with a moderate adjustment speed toward the long-run equilibrium. This result is explained by the shortage of skilled workers in GCC countries compared to advanced countries, where the findings show a positive and significant effect of ICT technologies on total employment, especially in the industrial sector. The adjustment speed toward the long run is significantly higher in advanced countries than in GCC countries.", "The study explored the multidimensional relationships between educational situation perception, teacher support, online learning engagement and academic self-efficacy in technology-based language learning in a sample of Chinese undergraduate students, and meanwhile examined the mediating effects of academic self-efficacy and teacher support. A total of 392 (126 male and 266 female) Chinese university students reported on their perceived educational situation, teacher support, online learning engagement, and academic self-efficacy. Results showed that educational situation perception was significantly and positively associated with teacher support, online learning engagement and academic self-efficacy; teacher support and academic self-efficacy was positively correlated with online learning engagement. More importantly, academic self-efficacy as well as teacher support mediated the relationship between educational situation perception and online learning engagement. These findings extended previous research by considering both the external factors (i.e., educational situation; teacher support) and the internal factors (i.e., academic self-efficacy) of influencing students' online learning engagement in technology-based language learning, thereby contributing to enhancing our understanding of the joint drive of the inherent and extrinsic power mechanisms. This study highlighted the following aspects: (1) strengthening the consideration of the key elements of the educational situation; (2) clarifying the pivotal position of intelligent technology in educational situations; and (3) emphasizing the reconstruction of intelligence teaching ecology driven by learning activities. Besides, this study indicated the significance of elevating teachers' awareness, willingness and capacity of the substantial supports in enhancing students' online learning engagement and would inform that the future research on the connotation and ways of teacher support should be responding to technology-based learning environments.", "Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO) is a recent well-established optimizer based on the hunting characteristics of Harris hawks, which shows excellent efficiency in solving a variety of optimization issues. However, it undergoes weak global search capability because of the levy distribution in its optimization process. In this paper, a variant of HHO is proposed using Crisscross Optimization Algorithm (CSO) to compensate for the shortcomings of original HHO. The novel developed optimizer called Crisscross Harris Hawks Optimizer (CCHHO), which can effectively achieve high-quality solutions with accelerated convergence on a variety of optimization tasks. In the proposed algorithm, the vertical crossover strategy of CSO is used for adjusting the exploitative ability adaptively to alleviate the local optimum; the horizontal crossover strategy of CSO is considered as an operator for boosting explorative trend; and the competitive operator is adopted to accelerate the convergence rate. The effectiveness of the proposed optimizer is evaluated using 4 kinds of benchmark functions, 3 constrained engineering optimization issues and feature selection problems on 13 datasets from the UCI repository.\u00a0Comparing with nine conventional intelligence algorithms and 9 state-of-the-art algorithms, the statistical results reveal that the proposed CCHHO is significantly more effective than HHO, CSO, CCNMHHO and other competitors, and its advantage is not influenced by the increase of problems' dimensions. Additionally, experimental results also illustrate that the proposed CCHHO outperforms some existing optimizers in working out engineering design optimization; for feature selection problems, it is superior to other feature selection methods including CCNMHHO in terms of fitness, error rate and length of selected features.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42235-022-00298-7.", "Since the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019, artificial intelligence technology has shown increasing values in the research and control of tropical infectious diseases. The introduction of artificial intelligence technology has shown remarkable effectiveness to reduce the diagnosis and treatment burdens, reduce missing diagnosis and misdiagnosis, improve the surveillance and forecast ability and enhance the medicine and vaccine development efficiency. This paper summarizes the current applications of artificial intelligence in tropical infectious disease control and research and discusses the important values of artificial intelligence in disease diagnosis and treatment, disease surveillance and forecast, vaccine and drug discovery, medical and public health services and global health governance. However, artificial intelligence technology suffers from problems of single and inaccurate diagnosis, poor disease surveillance and forecast ability in open environments, limited capability of intelligent system services, big data management and model interpretability. Hereby, we propose suggestions with aims to improve multimodal intelligent diagnosis of multiple tropical infectious diseases, emphasize intelligent surveillance and forecast of vectors and high-risk populations in open environments, accelerate the research and development of intelligent management system, strengthen ethical security, big data management and model interpretability.\n\uff3b\u6458\u8981\uff3d \u81ea\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u80ba\u708e\u75ab\u60c5\u53d1\u751f\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5728\u70ed\u5e26\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u9010\u6e10\u51f8\u663e\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u7f13\u89e3\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u7597\u8d1f\u62c5\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u75be\u75c5\u6f0f\u8bca\u548c\u8bef\u8bca\u7387\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u75be\u75c5\u76d1\u6d4b\u9884\u8b66\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u533b\u836f\u548c\u75ab\u82d7\u7814\u53d1\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u5747\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6210\u6548\u3002\u6728\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u70ed\u5e26\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u9632\u63a7\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u8bba\u8ff0\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u7597\u3001\u76d1\u6d4b\u9884\u8b66\u3001\u75ab\u82d7\u4e0e\u836f\u7269\u6316\u6398\u3001\u533b\u7597\u4e0e\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u5168\u7403\u536b\u751f\u6cbb\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u9274\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u52a9\u529b\u70ed\u5e26\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u9632\u63a7\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u8bca\u65ad\u5355\u4e00\u548c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u9884\u8b66\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u4f73\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u670d\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3001\u5927\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u96be\u9898, \u6728\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a0\u5f3a\u591a\u79cd\u70ed\u5e26\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u91cd\u89c6\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5a92\u4ecb\u751f\u7269\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\u667a\u80fd\u76d1\u6d4b\u9884\u8b66\u3001\u52a0\u5feb\u667a\u80fd\u9632\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u53d1\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u4f26\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5927\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u53d1\u5c55\u5efa\u8bae\u3002.", "Lung, being one of the most important organs in human body, is often affected by various SARS diseases, among which COVID-19 has been found to be the most fatal disease in recent times. In fact, SARS-COVID 19 led to pandemic that spreads fast among the community causing respiratory problems. Under such situation, radiological imaging-based screening [mostly chest X-ray and computer tomography (CT) modalities] has been performed for rapid screening of the disease as it is a non-invasive approach. Due to scarcity of physician/chest specialist/expert doctors, technology-enabled disease screening techniques have been developed by several researchers with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). It can be remarkably observed that the researchers have introduced several AI/ML/DL (deep learning) algorithms for computer-assisted detection of COVID-19 using chest X-ray and CT images. In this paper, a comprehensive review has been conducted to summarize the works related to applications of AI/ML/DL for diagnostic prediction of COVID-19, mainly using X-ray and CT images. Following the PRISMA guidelines, total 265 articles have been selected out of 1715 published articles till the third quarter of 2021. Furthermore, this review summarizes and compares varieties of ML/DL techniques, various datasets, and their results using X-ray and CT imaging. A detailed discussion has been made on the novelty of the published works, along with advantages and limitations.", "The \"Taxonomy of Artificial Intelligence for Medical Services and Procedures\" became part of the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT\u00ae) code set effective January 1, 2022. It provides a framework for discrete and differentiable CPT codes which; are consistent with the features of the devices' output, characterize interaction between the device and the physician or other qualified health care professional, and foster appropriate payment. Descriptors include \"Assistive\", \"Augmentative\", and \"Autonomous\". As software increasingly augments the provision of medical services the taxonomy will foster consistent language in coding enabling patient, provider, and payer access to the benefits of innovation.", "Among the main features of biological intelligence are energy efficiency, capacity for continual adaptation, and risk management via uncertainty quantification. Neuromorphic engineering has been thus far mostly driven by the goal of implementing energy-efficient machines that take inspiration from the time-based computing paradigm of biological brains. In this paper, we take steps toward the design of neuromorphic systems that are capable of adaptation to changing learning tasks, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty quantification estimates. To this end, we derive online learning rules for spiking neural networks (SNNs) within a Bayesian continual learning framework. In it, each synaptic weight is represented by parameters that quantify the current epistemic uncertainty resulting from prior knowledge and observed data. The proposed online rules update the distribution parameters in a streaming fashion as data are observed. We instantiate the proposed approach for both real-valued and binary synaptic weights. Experimental results using Intel's Lava platform show the merits of Bayesian over frequentist learning in terms of capacity for adaptation and uncertainty quantification.", "The case for a renewed focus on Nature in drug discovery is reviewed; not in terms of natural product screening, but how and why biomimetic molecules, especially those produced by natural processes, should deliver in the age of artificial intelligence and screening of vast collections both in vitro and in silico. The declining natural product-likeness of licensed drugs and the consequent physicochemical implications of this trend in the context of current practices are noted. To arrest these trends, the logic of seeking new bioactive agents with enhanced natural mimicry is considered; notably that molecules constructed by proteins (enzymes) are more likely to interact with other proteins (e.g., targets and transporters), a notion validated by natural products. Nature's finite number of building blocks and their interactions necessarily reduce potential numbers of structures, yet these enable expansion of chemical space with their inherent diversity of physical characteristics, pertinent to property-based design. The feasible variations on natural motifs are considered and expanded to encompass pseudo-natural products, leading to the further logical step of harnessing bioprocessing routes to access them. Together, these offer opportunities for enhancing natural mimicry, thereby bringing innovation to drug synthesis exploiting the characteristics of natural recognition processes. The potential for computational guidance to help identifying binding commonalities in the route map is a logical opportunity to enable the design of tailored molecules, with a focus on \"organic/biological\" rather than purely \"synthetic\" structures. The design and synthesis of prototype structures should pay dividends in the disposition and efficacy of the molecules, while inherently enabling greener and more sustainable manufacturing techniques.", "Leaders of today need to achieve well in terms of task performance, perceiving low stress, and having high levels of work engagement. One may ask whether trait-based leadership resource factors can be identified and how such resource factors might relate to task performance, perceived stress, and work engagement. Our aim was to test the hypothesis, derived from Hobfoll's motivational Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, that there are trait-based leadership resource factors, which are differentially correlated to the leaders' task performance, perceived stress, and work engagement. Leaders (N\u2009=\u2009344) aged from 23 to 65 years (M\u2009=\u200949, SD\u2009=\u20098.6; 58% women) completed an online questionnaire including measures of task performance, perceived stress, work engagement, personality traits, trait emotional intelligence, empathy, performance-related self-esteem, compassionate and rational leadership competence, and coping resources for stress. Using exploratory factor analysis, we identified four trait-based leadership resource factors. With Bonferroni adjustment, and controlling for sex, age, number of years in the current managerial position, self-deceptive enhancement, and impression management, only Rational Mastery was significantly positively correlated with task performance. Rational Mastery, Efficient Coping, and Modesty were negatively correlated with perceived stress, and all factors except Modesty, but including the fourth (Good-Heartedness) were positively correlated with work engagement. Organizations striving for sustainable work conditions should support trait-based leadership, which depends not only on a task-oriented resource such as rational mastery, but also on human-oriented resources such as efficient coping, modesty, and good-heartedness, all of them being differentially related to task performance, perceived stress, and work engagement.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12144-022-03767-8.", "Excessive cannabis use may lead to lower educational attainment. However, this association may be due to confounders and reverse causality. We tested the potential causal relationship between cannabis use disorder (CUD) or life-time cannabis use (LCU) and educational attainment.\nBidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted. Our primary method was inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR, with a series of sensitivity analyses. Multivariable MR (MVMR) was performed to estimate any direct effect independent of intelligence, smoking initiation or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nEuropean ancestry individuals. The sample sizes of the genome-wide association study ranged from 55\u2009374 to 632\u2009802 participants.\nGenetic variants of CUD, LCU or educational attainment.\nUsing univariable MR, we found evidence of a potential causal effect of genetic liability to CUD on a lower educational attainment [MR, 95% confidence interval (CI)inverse variance weighted (IVW) \u2009=\u2009-1.2\u00a0month (-1.9\u00a0month, -0.5\u00a0month); P\u2009=\u20090.0008].

We also found evidence of potential causal effect from genetic liability to higher educational attainment to higher risk of LCU [OR, 95% CIIVW \u2009=\u20091.35 (1.11, 1.66), P\u2009=\u20090.0033].\nGenetic liability to cannabis use disorder may lead to lower educational attainment. Genetic liability to higher educational attainment may also lead to higher life-time cannabis use risk and lower cannabis use disorder risk. However, the bidirectional effect between cannabis use disorder and educational attainment may be due to shared risk factors (e.g. attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder).", "Covid-19 infections are spreading around the globe since December 2019. Several diagnostic methods were developed based on biological investigations and the success of each method depends on the accuracy of identifying Covid infections. However, access to diagnostic tools can be limited, depending on geographic region and the diagnosis duration plays an important role in treating Covid-19. Since the virus causes pneumonia, its presence can also be detected using medical imaging by Radiologists. Hospitals with X-ray capabilities are widely distributed all over the world, so a method for diagnosing Covid-19 from chest X-rays would present itself. Studies have shown promising results in automatically detecting Covid-19 from medical images using supervised Artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. The major drawback of supervised learning algorithms is that they require huge amounts of data to train. Also, the radiology equipment is not computationally efficient for deep neural networks. Therefore, we aim to develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based image augmentation to optimize the performance of custom, light, Convolutional networks used for the classification of Chest X-rays (CXR).\nA Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network (PGGAN) is used to generate synthetic and augmented data to supplement the dataset. We propose two novel CNN architectures to perform the Multi-class classification of Covid-19, healthy and pneumonia affected Chest X-rays. Comparisons have been drawn to the state of the art models and transfer learning methods to evaluate the superiority of the networks. All the models are trained using enhanced and augmented X-ray images and are compared based on classification metrics.\nThe proposed models had extremely high classification metrics with proposed Architectures having test accuracy of 98.78% and 99.2% respectively while having 40% lesser training parameters than their state of the art counterpart.\nIn the present study, a method based on artificial intelligence is proposed, leading to a rapid diagnostic tool for Covid infections based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The benefit will be a high accuracy of detection with up to 99% hit rate, a rapid diagnosis, and an accessible Covid identification method by chest X-ray images.", "In this article, the co-editors of the corporate responsibility: quantitative issues section of the journal provide an overview of the quantitative CSR field and offer some new perspectives on where the field is going. They highlight key issues in developing impactful, theory-driven, and ethically grounded research and call for research that examines complex problems facing businesses and the society (e.g., big data and artificial intelligence, political polarization, and the role of CSR in generating social impact). By examining topics that are under-researched, forward-looking, and socially oriented, scholars can expand the boundary of CSR's substantive domain and produce research that helps businesses act in a long-term, socially responsible way in this quickly evolving, turbulent environment. They also discuss ways to enhance the methodological rigor of quantitative CSR research and encourage scholars to employ cutting-edge, innovative methods to shed light on the micro-level mechanisms of CSR and reveal patterns and relationships hidden in unstructured big data.", "Due to the huge surge in remote work all over the world caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, today's work is largely defined by tools for information exchange as well as new complex problems that must be solved. Design Thinking offers a well-known and established methodological approach for iterative, collaborative and interdisciplinary problem solving. Still, recent circumstances shed a new light on how to facilitate Design Thinking activities in a remote rather than an analog way. Due to Design Thinking's high production of artifacts and its focus on communication and interaction between team members, the theory of Distributed Cognition, specifically the Distributed Cognition for Teamwork (DiCoT) framework, provides an interesting perspective on the recent going-remote of Design Thinking activities. For this, we first highlight differences of analog vs. remote Design Thinking by analyzing corresponding literature from the recent years. Next, we apply the DiCoT framework to those findings, pointing out implications for practical facilitation of Design Thinking activities in an analog and remote setting. Finally, we discuss opportunities through artificial intelligence-based technologies and methods.", "The use of the big data analytics technology to collect, summarize and analyze medical big data is effective to precisely mine and explore the underlying information, which greatly facilitates medical science research and clinical practices.

So far, few reviews have been deployed to explore how AI empowers English as Foreign Language (EFL) teaching and learning. This study attempts to give a brief yet profound overview of AI in the EFL context by summarizing and delineating six dominant forms of AI application, including Automatic Evaluation Systems, Neural Machine Translation Tools, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), AI Chatting Robots, Intelligent Virtual Environment, and Affective Computing (AC) in ITSs. The review furthermore uncovers a current paucity of research on applying AC in the EFL context and exploring pedagogical and ethical implications of AI in the EFL context. Ultimately, challenges from technical and teachers' perspectives, as well as future research directions, are illuminated, hopefully proffering new insights for the future study.", "Skin cancer is one of the most common types of malignancy, affecting a large population and causing a heavy economic burden worldwide. Over the last few years, computer-aided diagnosis has been rapidly developed and make great progress in healthcare and medical practices due to the advances in artificial intelligence, particularly with the adoption of convolutional neural networks. However, most studies in skin cancer detection keep pursuing high prediction accuracies without considering the limitation of computing resources on portable devices. In this case, the knowledge distillation (KD) method has been proven as an efficient tool to help improve the adaptability of lightweight models under limited resources, meanwhile keeping a high-level representation capability. To bridge the gap, this study specifically proposes a novel method, termed SSD-KD, that unifies diverse knowledge into a generic KD framework for skin disease classification. Our method models an intra-instance relational feature representation and integrates it with existing KD research. A dual relational knowledge distillation architecture is self-supervised trained while the weighted softened outputs are also exploited to enable the student model to capture richer knowledge from the teacher model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on ISIC 2019, a large-scale open-accessed benchmark of skin diseases dermoscopic images. Experiments show that our distilled MobileNetV2 can achieve an accuracy as high as 85% for the classification tasks of 8 different skin diseases with minimal parameters and computing requirements. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our intra- and inter-instance relational knowledge integration strategy. Compared with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation techniques, the proposed method demonstrates improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep knowledge distillation application for multi-disease classification on the large-scale dermoscopy database. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/enkiwang/Portable-Skin-Lesion-Diagnosis.", "Conversational interaction, for example through chatbots, is well-suited to enable automated health coaching tools to support self-management and prevention of chronic diseases. However, chatbots in health are predominantly scripted or rule-based, which can result in a stagnant and repetitive user experience in contrast with more dynamic, data-driven chatbots in other domains. Consequently, little is known about the tradeoffs of pursuing data-driven approaches for health chatbots. We examined multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to enable micro-coaching dialogs in nutrition - brief coaching conversations related to specific meals, to support achievement of nutrition goals - and compared, reinforcement learning (RL), rule-based, and scripted approaches for dialog management. While the data-driven RL chatbot succeeded in shorter, more efficient dialogs, surprisingly the simplest, scripted chatbot was rated as higher quality, despite not fulfilling its task as consistently. These results highlight tensions between scripted and more complex, data-driven approaches for chatbots in health.", "To evaluate the application value of a generally trained artificial intelligence (AI) automatic diagnosis system in the malignancy diagnosis of rare thyroid carcinomas, such as follicular thyroid carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, primary thyroid lymphoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and compare the diagnostic performance with radiologists of different experience levels.\nWe retrospectively studied 342 patients with 378 thyroid nodules that included 196 rare malignant nodules by using postoperative pathology as the gold standard, and compared the diagnostic performances of three radiologists (one junior, one mid-level, one senior) and that of AI automatic diagnosis system.\nThe accuracy of the AI system in malignancy diagnosis was 0.825, which was significantly higher than that of all three radiologists and higher than the best radiologist in this study by a margin of 0.097 with P-value of 2.252\u2009\u00d7\u200910-16. The mid-level radiologist and senior radiologist had higher sensitivity (0.857 and 0.959) than that of the AI system (0.847) at the cost of having much lower specificity (0.533, 0.478 versus 0.802). The junior radiologist showed relatively balanced sensitivity and specificity (0.816 and 0.549) but both were lower than that of the AI system.\nThe generally trained AI automatic diagnosis system showed high accuracy in the differential diagnosis of begin nodules and rare malignancy nodules. It may assist radiologists for screening of rare malignancy nodules that even senior radiologists are not acquainted with.", "Breed identification utilizing multiple information sources and methods is widely applicated in the field of animal genetics and breeding. Simultaneously, with the development of artificial intelligence, the integration of high-throughput genomic data and machine learning techniques is increasingly used for breed identification. In this context, we used 654 individuals from 15 pig breeds, evaluating the performance of machine learning and stacking ensemble learning classifiers, as well as the function of feature selection and anomaly detection in different scenarios. Our results showed that, when using a training set of 16 individuals per breed and 32 features (SNPs), the accuracy of breed identification with feature selection (eXtreme Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) could exceed 95.00% (nine breeds), and was improved by 7.04% over the results with random selection. For stacking ensemble learning, feature selection methods (including random selection method) were used before different base learners. When these base learners' training set had 16 individuals per breed and 32 features, the accuracy of stacking ensemble learning improved by 9.24% over the best base learner (nine breeds), but did not significantly increase the advantage over the models with XGBoost feature selection. When using a training set of 16 individuals and 512 features per breed, breed identification with anomaly detection (local outlier factor, LOF) and random selection could achieve an accuracy of 89.06% (15 breeds). These results show that machine learning could be an effective tool for breed identification and this study will also provide useful information for the application of machine learning in animal genetics and breeding.", "Literature surrounding artificial intelligence (AI)-related applications for hip and knee arthroplasty has proliferated. However, meaningful advances that fundamentally transform the practice and delivery of joint arthroplasty are yet to be realized, despite the broad range of applications as we continue to search for meaningful and appropriate use of AI. AI literature in hip and knee arthroplasty between 2018 and 2021 regarding image-based analyses, value-based care, remote patient monitoring, and augmented reality was reviewed. Concerns surrounding meaningful use and appropriate methodological approaches of AI in joint arthroplasty research are summarized. Of the 233 AI-related orthopaedics articles published, 178 (76%) constituted original research, while the rest consisted of editorials or reviews. A total of 52% of original AI-related research concerns hip and knee arthroplasty (n = 92), and a narrative review is described. Three studies were externally validated. Pitfalls surrounding present-day research include conflating vernacular (\"AI/machine learning\"), repackaging limited registry data, prematurely releasing internally validated prediction models, appraising model architecture instead of inputted data, withholding code, and evaluating studies using antiquated regression-based guidelines. While AI has been applied to a variety of hip and knee arthroplasty applications with limited clinical impact, the future remains promising if the question is meaningful, the methodology is rigorous and transparent, the data are rich, and the model is externally validated. Simple checkpoints for meaningful AI adoption include ensuring applications focus on: administrative support over clinical evaluation and management; necessity of the advanced model; and the novelty of the question being answered.Cite this article: Bone Joint J\u00a02022;104-B(12):1292-1303.", "By utilizing their powerful metabolic versatility, filamentous fungi can be utilized in bioprocesses aimed at achieving circular economy.

Artificial intelligence is, on the other hand, a domain within computer science that aims at designing tools and machines with the capacity to execute functions that would usually require human aptitude. Process flexibility, enhanced data reliability and increased productivity are some of the benefits of integrating automation and artificial intelligence in fungi-based bioprocesses. One of the existing gaps that requires further investigation is the use of such data-based technologies in the production of food from fungi.", "Nowadays, breast and cervical cancers are respectively the first and fourth most common causes of cancer death in females. It is believed that, automated systems based on artificial intelligence would allow the early diagnostic which increases significantly the chances of proper treatment and survival. Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved human-level performance in object classification tasks, the regular growing of the amount of medical data and the continuous increase of the number of classes make them difficult to learn new tasks without being re-trained from scratch. Nevertheless, fine tuning and transfer learning in deep models are techniques that lead to the well-known catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, an Incremental Deep Tree (IDT) framework for biological image classification is proposed to address the catastrophic forgetting of CNNs allowing them to learn new classes while maintaining acceptable accuracies on the previously learnt ones. To evaluate the performance of our approach, the IDT framework is compared against with three popular incremental methods, namely iCaRL, LwF and SupportNet. The experimental results on MNIST dataset achieved 87\u202f% of accuracy and the obtained values on the BreakHis, the LBC and the SIPaKMeD datasets are promising with 92\u202f%, 98\u202f% and 93\u202f% respectively.", "We report the main conclusions of the first Chemoinformatics and Artificial Intelligence Colloquium, Mexico City, June 15-17, 2022. Fifteen lectures were presented during a virtual public event with speakers from industry, academia, and non-for-profit organizations. Twelve hundred and ninety students and academics from more than 60 countries. During the meeting, applications, challenges, and opportunities in drug discovery, de novo drug design, ADME-Tox (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) property predictions, organic chemistry, peptides, and antibiotic resistance were discussed.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming both of these areas. Currently, humans are leaders, managers, and decision makers in complex health services. However, with the rise of AI, the time has come to ask whether humans will continue to have meaningful decision-making roles in this domain. Further, rationality has long dominated this space. What role will intuition play?\nThe aim is to establish a protocol of protocols to be used in the proposed research, which aims to explore whether humans will continue in meaningful decision-making roles in complex health services in an AI-driven future.\nThis paper describes a set of protocols for the proposed research, which is designed as a 4-step project across two phases. This paper describes the protocols for each step. The first step is a scoping review to identify and map human attributes that influence decision-making in complex health services. The research question focuses on the attributes that influence human decision-making in this context as reported in the literature. The second step is a scoping review to identify and map AI attributes that influence decision-making in complex health services. The research question focuses on attributes that influence AI decision-making in this context as reported in the literature. The third step is a comparative analysis: a narrative comparison followed by a mathematical comparison of the two sets of attributes-human and AI. This analysis will investigate whether humans have one or more unique attributes that could influence decision-making for the better. The fourth step is a simulation of a nonclinical environment in health regulation and policy into which virtual human and AI decision makers (agents) are introduced. The virtual human and AI will be based on the human and AI attributes identified in the scoping reviews. The simulation will explore, observe, and document how humans interact with AI, and whether humans are likely to compete, cooperate, or converge with AI.\nThe results will be presented in tabular form, visually intuitive formats, and-in the case of the simulation-multimedia formats.\nThis paper provides a road map for the proposed research. It also provides an example of a protocol of protocols for methods used in complex health research. While there are established guidelines for a priori protocols for scoping reviews, there is a paucity of guidance on establishing a protocol of protocols. This paper takes the first step toward building a scaffolding for future guidelines in this regard.\nPRR1-10.2196/42353.", "Dentistry based on\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI) is not a myth but turning into a reality. AI has revolutionized medicine and dentistry in various ways. AI is a technology that uses machines to imitate intelligent human behavior. AI is gaining popularity worldwide because of\u00a0its significant impact and breakthrough in the field of intelligence innovation. It is a lifesaver in dentistry, particularly in the field of prosthodontics, because it aids in the design of prostheses and the fabrication of functional maxillofacial appliances. It also helps in the processes of patient documentation, diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management, allowing oral healthcare professionals to work smarter rather than harder. While it cannot replace the work of a dentist because dentistry is not about disease diagnosis, it does involve correlation with other clinical findings and provides treatment to the patient. The integration of AI and digitization has brought a new paradigm in dentistry, with extremely promising prospects. The availability of insufficient and inaccurate data is now the only barrier to the deployment of AI. Therefore, dentists and clinicians must focus on collecting and entering authentic data into their database, which will be completely utilized for AI in dentistry shortly. This study focuses on various applications of AI in prosthodontics along with its limitations and future scope.", "Reflux episodes and postreflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave (PSPW) index are useful impedance parameters that can augment the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, manual analysis of pH-impedance tracings is time consuming, resulting in limited use of these novel impedance metrics. This study aims to evaluate whether a supervised learning artificial intelligence (AI) model is useful to identify reflux episodes and PSPW index.\nConsecutive patients underwent 24-h impedance-pH monitoring were enrolled for analysis. Multiple AI and machine learning with a deep residual net model for image recognition were explored based on manual interpretation of reflux episodes and PSPW according to criteria from the Wingate Consensus. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to measure the strength of inter-rater agreement of data between manual and AI interpretations.\nWe analyzed 106 eligible patients with 7939 impedance events, of whom 38 patients with pathological acid exposure time (AET) and 68 patients with physiological AET. On the manual interpretation, patients with pathological AET had more reflux episodes and lower PSPW index than those with physiological AET. Overall accuracy of AI identification for reflux episodes and PSPW achieved 87% and 82%, respectively. Inter-rater agreements between AI and manual interpretations achieved excellent for individual numbers of reflux episodes and PSPW index (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.965 and ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.921).\nAI has the potential to accurately and efficiently measure impedance metrics including reflux episodes and PSPW index. AI can be a reliable adjunct for measuring novel impedance metrics for GERD in the near future.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more important especially in datacentric fields, such as biomedical research and biobanking. However, AI does not only offer advantages and promising benefits, but brings about also ethical risks and perils. In recent years, there has been growing interest in AI ethics, as reflected by a huge number of (scientific) literature dealing with the topic of AI ethics. The main objectives of this review are: (1) to provide an overview about important (upcoming) AI ethics regulations and international recommendations as well as available AI ethics tools and frameworks relevant to biomedical research, (2) to identify what AI ethics can learn from findings in ethics of traditional biomedical research - in particular looking at ethics in the domain of biobanking, and (3) to provide an overview about the main research questions in the field of AI ethics in biomedical research.\nWe adopted a modified thematic review approach focused on understanding AI ethics aspects relevant to biomedical research. For this review, four scientific literature databases at the cross-section of medical, technical, and ethics science literature were queried: PubMed, BMC Medical Ethics, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. In addition, a grey literature search was conducted to identify current trends in legislation and standardization.\nMore than 2,500 potentially relevant publications were retrieved through the initial search and 57 documents were included in the final review. The review found many documents describing high-level principles of AI ethics, and some publications describing approaches for making AI ethics more actionable and bridging the principles-to-practice gap. Also, some ongoing regulatory and standardization initiatives related to AI ethics were identified. It was found that ethical aspects of AI implementation in biobanks are often like those in biomedical research, for example with regards to handling big data or tackling informed consent. The review revealed current 'hot' topics in AI ethics related to biomedical research. Furthermore, several published tools and methods aiming to support practical implementation of AI ethics, as well as tools and frameworks specifically addressing complete and transparent reporting of biomedical studies involving AI are described in the review results.\nThe review results provide a practically useful overview of research strands as well as regulations, guidelines, and tools regarding AI ethics in biomedical research. Furthermore, the review results show the need for an ethical-mindful and balanced approach to AI in biomedical research, and specifically reveal the need for AI ethics research focused on understanding and resolving practical problems arising from the use of AI in science and society.", "Psychological stress is a big threat to people's health. Early detection of psychological stress is important. The design of a stress recognition device based on the ECG (electrocardiograph) signal is presented in this paper. The device features intelligence, precision, portability, fast response, and low power consumption. In the design, the ECG signals are acquired by the AD8232 ECG module and processed by a low power consumption FPGA (Field Programmable Gated Array) development board PYNQ-Z2. Meanwhile, a modified Deep Forest model named Aw-Deep Forest (Adaptive Weight Deep Forest) is proposed. The Aw-Deep Forest has better performance than the Deep Forest model because it improves the fitting quality of the forests. By implementing the Aw-Deep Forest model on the FPGA, the device can assess people's state of psychological stress by analyzing the HRV (heart rate variability) parameters from ECG data. This paper mainly introduces the detailed process of ECG signal collecting, filtering, analog signal to digital signal conversion, HRV parameter analysis, and psychological stress recognition with Aw-Deep Forest. The final accuracy is 81.39%.", "Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in preterm infants without a specific medical treatment to date.\nTo assess the safety and short-term outcomes of high-dose erythropoietin in preterm infants with IVH.\nBetween April 1, 2014, and August 3, 2018, a randomized double-blind clinical trial enrolled 121 preterm infants (gestational age <32 weeks or birth weight <1500 g) aged 8 or less days with moderate to severe IVH identified by cerebral ultrasonography from 8 Swiss and Austrian tertiary neonatal units. Statistical analyses were performed between October 1, 2019, and September 12, 2022.\nInfants received intravenous high-dose erythropoietin (2000 units/kg body weight) or placebo at 4 time points between weeks 1 and 4 of life.\nSecondary outcomes included (1) mortality and morbidity rates and (2) brain magnetic resonance imaging findings at term-equivalent age (TEA). The primary outcome was the composite intelligence quotient at 5 years of age (not available before 2023).\nSixty infants (48% male [n\u2009=\u200929]) were randomly assigned to receive erythropoietin, and 61 infants (61% male [n\u2009=\u200937]) were randomly assigned to receive placebo. The median birth weight was 832 g (IQR, 687-990 g) in the erythropoietin group and 870 g (IQR, 680-1110 g) in the placebo group. Median gestation was 26.1 weeks (IQR, 24.8-27.3 weeks) in the erythropoietin group and 27.0 weeks (24.9-28.1 weeks) in the placebo group. The 2 groups had similar baseline characteristics and morbidities. Up to TEA, 10 newborns died (16.7%) in the erythropoietin group, and 5 newborns (8.2%) died in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio, 2.24 [95% CI, 0.74-7.66]; P\u2009=\u2009.15). Infants receiving erythropoietin had higher mean hematocrit levels. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging at TEA for 100 infants showed no significant differences in global or regional brain injury scores.\nThis preliminary report of a randomized clinical trial found no evidence that high-dose erythropoietin in preterm infants with IVH affects brain injury scores on conventional magnetic resonance imaging at TEA. Higher mortality in the erythropoietin group was not significant but should be reassessed based on future results from similar trials.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02076373.", "Intraoperative pathological diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) tumours is essential to planning patient management in neuro-oncology. Frozen section slides and cytological preparations provide architectural and cellular information that is analysed by pathologists to reach an intraoperative diagnosis. Progress in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning means that AI systems have significant potential for the provision of highly accurate real-time diagnosis in cytopathology.\nTo investigate the efficiency of machine-learning models in the intraoperative cytological diagnosis of CNS tumours.\nWe trained a deep neural network to classify biopsy material for intraoperative tissue diagnosis of four major brain lesions. Overall, 205 medical images were obtained from squash smear slides of histologically correlated cases, with 18 high-grade and 11 low-grade gliomas, 17 metastatic carcinomas, and 9 non-neoplastic pathological brain tissue samples. The neural network model was trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation.\nThe model achieved 95% and 97% diagnostic accuracy in the patch-level classification and patient-level classification tasks, respectively.\nWe conclude that deep learning-based classification of cytological preparations may be a promising complementary method for the rapid and accurate intraoperative diagnosis of CNS tumours.", "Individuals with intellectual disability (ID) experience protracted cognitive development compared with typical youth. Sensitive measurement of cognitive change in this population is a critical need for clinical trials and other intervention studies, but well-validated outcome measures are scarce. This study's aim was to evaluate the sensitivity of the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB) to detect developmental changes in groups with ID-fragile X syndrome (FXS), Down syndrome (DS), and other ID (OID)-and to provide further support for its use as an outcome measure for treatment trials.\nWe administered the NIHTB-CB and a reference standard cross-validation measure (Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition [SB5]) to 256 individuals with FXS, DS, and OID (ages 6-27 years). After 2 years of development, we retested 197 individuals. Group developmental changes in each cognitive domain of the NIHTB-CB and SB5 were assessed using latent change score models, and 2-year growth was evaluated at 3 age points (10, 16, and 22 years).\nOverall, effect sizes of growth measured by the NIHTB-CB tests were comparable with or exceeded those of the SB5. The NIHTB-CB showed significant gains in almost all domains in OID at younger ages (10 years), with continued gains at 16 years and stability in early adulthood (22 years). The FXS group showed delayed gains in attention and inhibitory control compared with OID. The DS group had delayed gains in receptive vocabulary compared with OID. Unlike the other groups, DS had significant growth in early adulthood in 2 domains (working memory and attention/inhibitory control). Notably, each group's pattern of NIHTB-CB growth across development corresponded to their respective pattern of SB5 growth.\nThe NIHTB-CB is sensitive to developmental changes in individuals with ID. Comparison with levels and timing of growth on the cross-validation measure shows that the NIHTB-CB has potential to identify meaningful trajectories across cognitive domains and ID etiologies. Sensitivity to change within the context of treatment studies and delineation of clinically meaningful changes in NIHTB-CB scores, linked to daily functioning, must be established in future research to evaluate the battery more completely as a key outcome measure.", "In recent years, the rapid increase in the global population, the challenges associated with climate change, and the emergence of new pandemics have all become major threats to food security worldwide. Consequently, innovative solutions are urgently needed to address the current challenges and enhance food sustainability. Green technologies have gained significant attention for many food applications, while the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) are reshaping different production and consumption sectors, such as food and agriculture. In this review, a general overview of green and Industry 4.0 technologies from a food perspective will be provided. Connections between green food technologies (e.g., green preservation, processing, extraction, and analysis) and Industry 4.0 enablers (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, and the Internet of Things) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be identified and explained. Green and Industry 4.0 technologies are both rapidly becoming a valuable part of meeting the SDGs. These technologies demonstrate high potential to foster ecological and digital transitions of food systems, delivering societal, economic, and environmental outcomes. A range of green technologies has already provided innovative solutions for major food system transformations, while the application of digital technologies and other Industry 4.0 technological innovations is still limited in the food sector. It is therefore expected that more green and digital solutions will be adopted in the coming years, harnessing their full potential to achieve a healthier, smarter, more sustainable and more resilient food future.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has been keeping asking urgent questions with respect to therapeutic options. Existing drugs that can be repurposed promise rapid implementation in practice because of their prior approval. Conceivably, there is still room for substantial improvement, because most advanced artificial intelligence techniques for screening drug repositories have not been exploited so far. We construct a comprehensive network by combining year-long curated drug-protein/protein-protein interaction data on the one hand, and most recent SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction data on the other hand. We learn the structure of the resulting encompassing molecular interaction network and predict missing links using variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs), as a most advanced deep learning technique that has not been explored so far. We focus on hitherto unknown links between drugs and human proteins that play key roles in the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thereby, we establish novel host-directed therapy (HDT) options whose utmost plausibility is confirmed by realistic simulations. As a consequence, many of the predicted links are likely to be crucial for the virus to thrive on the one hand, and can be targeted with existing drugs on the other hand.", "Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that seriously endangers human health and affects socioeconomic developments. Artificial intelligence technology has been widely used in clinical medical sciences, including tumor screening, and electrocardiogram, imaging and pathological analyses, which has potential for precision control of schistosomiasis. Currently, artificial intelligence technology has been employed for clinical assessment of schistosomiasis-associated hepatic fibrosis and ectopic schistosomiasis, prognostic prediction of advanced schistosomiasis, automated identification of Oncomelania hupensis and Schistosoma japonicum eggs and miracidia, epidemiological surveillance of schistosomiasis, and drug discovery. This review summarizes the advances in the applications of artificial intelligence technology in the management of schistosomiasis and proposes the prospects for the use of artificial intelligence in schistosomiasis elimination.\n\uff3b\u6458\u8981\uff3d \u8840\u5438\u866b\u75c5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e25\u91cd\u5371\u5bb3\u4eba\u7c7b\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5bc4\u751f\u866b\u75c5\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5df3\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u80bf\u7624\u7b5b\u67e5\u3001\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8840\u5438\u866b\u75c5\u7cbe\u51c6\u9632\u63a7\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5df3\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8840\u5438\u866b\u75c5\u809d\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u3001\u5f02\u4f4d\u8840\u5438\u866b\u75c5\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30, \u665a\u671f\u8840\u5438\u866b\u75c5\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b, \u9489\u87ba\u3001\u866b\u5375\u3001\u6bdb\u5466\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8840\u5438\u866b\u75c5\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8840\u5438\u866b\u75c5\u9632\u63a7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e0e\u524d\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002.", "Conventional electromagnetic (EM) sensing techniques such as radar and LiDAR are widely used for remote sensing, vehicle applications, weather monitoring, and clinical monitoring. Acoustic techniques such as sonar and ultrasound sensors are also used for consumer applications, such as ranging and in vivo medical/healthcare applications. It has been of long-term interest to doctors and clinical practitioners to realize continuous healthcare monitoring in hospitals and/or homes. Physiological and biopotential signals in real-time serve as important health indicators to predict and prevent serious illness. Emerging electromagnetic-acoustic (EMA) sensing techniques synergistically combine the merits of EM sensing with acoustic imaging to achieve comprehensive detection of physiological and biopotential signals. Further, EMA enables complementary fusion sensing for challenging healthcare settings, such as real-world long-term monitoring of treatment effects at home or in remote environments. This article reviews various examples of EMA sensing instruments, including implementation, performance, and application from the perspectives of circuits to systems. The novel and significant applications to healthcare are discussed. Three types of EMA sensors are presented: (1) Chip-based radar sensors for health status monitoring, (2) Thermo-acoustic sensing instruments for biomedical applications, and (3) Photoacoustic (PA) sensing and imaging systems, including dedicated reconstruction algorithms were reviewed from time-domain, frequency-domain, time-reversal, and model-based solutions. The future of EMA techniques for continuous healthcare with enhanced accuracy supported by artificial intelligence (AI) is also presented.", "Since Mark Zuckerberg's announcement about the development of new three-dimensional virtual worlds for social communication, a great debate has been raised about the promise of such a technology. The metaverse, a term formed by combining meta and universe, could open a new era in mental health, mainly in psychological disorders, where the creation of a full-body illusion via digital avatar could promote healthcare and personal well-being. Patients affected by body dysmorphism symptoms (i.e., eating disorders), social deficits (i.e. autism) could greatly benefit from this kind of technology. However, it is not clear which advantage the metaverse would have in treating psychological disorders with respect to the well-known and effective virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy. Indeed, in the last twenty years, a plethora of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of VR technology in reducing symptoms of pain, anxiety, stress, as well as, in improving cognitive and social skills. We hypothesize that the metaverse will offer more opportunities, such as a more complex, virtual realm where sensory inputs, and recurrent feedback, mediated by a \"federation\" of multiple technologies - e.g., artificial intelligence, tangible interfaces, Internet of Things and blockchain, can be reinterpreted for facilitating a new kind of communication overcoming self-body representation. However, nowadays a clear starting point does not exist. For this reason, it is worth defining a theoretical framework for applying this new kind of technology in a social neuroscience context for developing accurate solutions to mental health in the future.", "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease in the world. The NAFLD spectrum includes simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genetic, nutritional factors, obesity, insulin resistance, gut microbiota are among the risk factors for NAFLD. The genetic variant Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) plays an important role in the development of a number of liver diseases ranging from steatosis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC. Due to the increase in the prevalence of NAFLD, new models are being developed with machine learning, deep learning, artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) to determine low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic methods. Models developed with ANN from AI modules are important in order to examine biochemical and genomic information in detail in the diagnosis of NAFLD. The aim of this study is to develop a simple ANN model using biochemical and genotypic parameters in the diagnosis of NAFLD. A total of 300 patients followed up with the diagnosis of NAFLD and 100 controls were included in the study. The data set was divided into two as training and test set. Genotyping of PNPLA3 (CC, CG, GG) as genomic analysis was performed with real time PCR device. The algorithm used for the diagnosis of NAFLD was designed using age, body mass index (BMI), mean platelet volume (MPV), insulin resistance (IR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), genotype PNPLA3 (CC, CG, GG) parameters. MLP Classifier algorithm from ANN was used in the development of the model. ANN algorithms are used in python programming language. Statistical analyzes were made in SPSS program. Percent accuracy, area under the ROC curve, confusion matrix, Positive (PPV) and Negative Predicted Value (NPV) values, precision, recall, and f1-score results were determined. The accuracy percentage was determined as 0.979 in the train set and 0.970 in the test set. The Log Loss value was set to 0.09. The developed neural network achieved an accuracy percentage of 97.0% during testing, with an area under the ROC curve value of 0.95. We think that the ANN model developed with genomic and biochemical parameters can be used as a cost-effective, noninvasive new predictive diagnostic model in clinical practice in the diagnosis of NAFLD.", "Background: The new coronavirus has been spreading since the beginning of 2020, and many efforts have been made to develop vaccines to help patients recover. It is now clear that the world needs a rapid solution to curb the spread of COVID-19 worldwide with non-clinical approaches such as artificial intelligence techniques. These approaches can be effective in reducing the burden on the health care system to provide the best possible way to diagnose the COVID-19 epidemic. This study was conducted to use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for the early detection of COVID-19 in patients. Methods: This retrospective study used data from hospitals affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in Iran. This dataset was collected in the period March to October 2020 andcontained 10055 cases with 63 features. We selected and compared six algorithms: C4.5, support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm using Rapid Miner software. The performance of algorithms was measured using evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, accuracy, and f-measure. Results: The results of the study show that among the various used classification methods in the diagnosis of coronavirus, SVM (93.41% accuracy) and C4.5 (91.87% accuracy) achieved the highest performance. According to the C4.5 decision tree, \"contact with a person who has COVID-19\" was considered the most important diagnostic criterion based on the Gini index. Conclusion: We found that ML approaches enable a reasonable level of accuracy in the diagnosis of COVID-19.", "The increasing amount of molecular data and knowledge about genomic alterations from next-generation sequencing processes together allow for a greater understanding of individual patients, thereby advancing precision medicine. Molecular tumour boards feature multidisciplinary teams of clinical experts who meet to discuss complex individual cancer cases. Preparing the meetings is a manual and time-consuming process.\nTo design a clinical decision support system to improve the multimodal data interpretation in molecular tumour board meetings for lymphoma patients at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. We investigated user needs and system requirements, explored the employment of artificial intelligence, and evaluated the proposed design with primary stakeholders.\nDesign science methodology was used to form and evaluate the proposed artefact. Requirements elicitation was done through a scoping review followed by five semi-structured interviews. We used UML Use Case diagrams to model user interaction and UML Activity diagrams to inform the proposed flow of control in the system. Additionally, we modelled the current and future workflow for MTB meetings and its proposed machine learning pipeline. Interactive sessions with end-users validated the initial requirements based on a fictive patient scenario which helped further refine the system.\nThe analysis showed that an interactive secure Web-based information system supporting the preparation of the meeting, multidisciplinary discussions, and clinical decision-making could address the identified requirements. Integrating artificial intelligence via continual learning and multimodal data fusion were identified as crucial elements that could provide accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.\nOur work is of methodological importance in that using artificial intelligence for molecular tumour boards is novel. We provide a consolidated proof-of-concept system that could support the end-to-end clinical decision-making process and positively and immediately impact patients.\nAugmenting a digital decision support system for molecular tumour boards with retrospective patient material is promising. This generates realistic and constructive material for human learning, and also digital data for continual learning by data-driven artificial intelligence approaches. The latter makes the future system adaptable to human bias, improving adequacy and decision quality over time and over tasks, while building and maintaining a digital log.", "Nutrition research is relying more on artificial intelligence and machine learning models to understand, diagnose, predict, and explain data. While artificial intelligence and machine learning models provide powerful modeling tools, failure to use careful and well-thought-out modeling processes can lead to misleading conclusions and concerns surrounding ethics and bias.\nBased on our experience as reviewers and journal editors in nutrition and obesity, we identified the most frequently omitted best practices from statistical modeling and how these same practices extend to machine learning models. We next addressed areas required for implementation of machine learning that are not included in commercial software packages.\nHere, we provide a tutorial on best artificial intelligence and machine learning modeling practices that can reduce potential ethical problems with a checklist and guiding principles to aid nutrition researchers in developing, evaluating, and implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning models in nutrition research.\nThe quality of AI/ML modeling in nutrition research requires iterative and tailored processes to mitigate against potential ethical problems or to predict conclusions that are free of bias.", "Since dementia is preventable with early interventions, biomarkers that assist in diagnosing early stages of dementia, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), are urgently needed.\nMultiomics analysis of amnestic MCI (aMCI) peripheral blood (n\u00a0=\u00a025) was performed covering the transcriptome, microRNA, proteome, and metabolome. Validation analysis for microRNAs was conducted in an independent cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a012). Artificial intelligence was used to identify the most important features for predicting aMCI.\nWe found that hsa-miR-4455 is the best biomarker in all omics analyses. The diagnostic index taking a ratio of hsa-miR-4455 to hsa-let-7b-3p predicted aMCI patients against healthy subjects with 97% overall accuracy. An integrated review of multiomics data suggested that a subset of T cells and the GCN (general control nonderepressible) pathway are associated with aMCI.\nThe multiomics approach has enabled aMCI biomarkers with high specificity and illuminated the accompanying changes in peripheral blood. Future large-scale studies are necessary to validate candidate biomarkers for clinical use.", "Malaria is an infectious disease caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium spp. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. It is the most common disease in resource-poor settings, with 241 million malaria cases reported in 2020 according to the World Health Organization. Optical microscopy examination of blood smears is the gold standard technique for malaria diagnosis; however, it is a time-consuming method and a well-trained microscopist is needed to perform the microbiological diagnosis. New techniques based on digital imaging analysis by deep learning and artificial intelligence methods are a challenging alternative tool for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In particular, systems based on Convolutional Neural Networks for image detection of the malaria parasites emulate the microscopy visualization of an expert. Microscope automation provides a fast and low-cost diagnosis, requiring less supervision. Smartphones are a suitable option for microscopic diagnosis, allowing image capture and software identification of parasites. In addition, image analysis techniques could be a fast and optimal solution for the diagnosis of malaria, tuberculosis, or Neglected Tropical Diseases in endemic areas with low resources. The implementation of automated diagnosis by using smartphone applications and new digital imaging technologies in low-income areas is a challenge to achieve. Moreover, automating the movement of the microscope slide and image autofocusing of the samples by hardware implementation would systemize the procedure. These new diagnostic tools would join the global effort to fight against pandemic malaria and other infectious and poverty-related diseases.", "Stable isotopic ratios can provide information for illicit drug profiling. The research presented here investigated the variations in stable isotopic ratios of hydrogen (\u03b42 H), carbon (\u03b413 C), nitrogen (\u03b415 N) and oxygen (\u03b418 O) during the synthesis of MDP2P (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone) and MDA (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine) prepared via the 'nitrostyrene' route.\nSamples of MDA and MDP2P were synthesised from two isotopically characterised starting materials, piperonal and nitroethane. The isotopic compositions of the nitrostyrene intermediate (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-nitropropene, MDP2NP) and products MDP2P and MDA were also measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry.\nA significantly negative change occurred to \u03b42 H values during the production of MDP2NP, MDP2P and MDA, indicating a mechanism that favours inclusion or retention of 1 H over 2 H. This suggests that the \u03b42 H compositions of MDA/MDP2P prepared from piperonal will not provide information on the synthetic history. Minimal changes were observed in \u03b413 C composition during the synthesis of MDP2NP, MDP2P and MDA, and minimal \u03b415 N compositional changes occurred in MDP2NP and MDA. Progressing from piperonal to MDP2NP, a minimal change occurred to \u03b418 O composition. A variable change to \u03b418 O was observed from MDP2NP with one sample becoming more positive in \u03b418 O composition and two samples becoming more negative. Progressing from MDP2NP to MDA, a significant negative change occurred to \u03b418 O composition.\nThe changes to stable isotopic ratios observed during the preparation of MDA and MDP2P from piperonal may prove useful when attempting to compare batch-to-batch variations between seizures and provide information with tactical intelligence applications.", "Despite improved ancillary investigations in epilepsy care, patients' narratives remain indispensable for diagnosing and treatment monitoring. This wealth of information is typically stored in electronic health records and accumulated in medical journals in an unstructured manner, thereby restricting complete utilization in clinical decision-making. To this end, clinical researchers increasing apply natural language processing (NLP)-a branch of artificial intelligence-as it removes ambiguity, derives context, and imbues standardized meaning from free-narrative clinical texts. This systematic review presents an overview of the current NLP applications in epilepsy and discusses the opportunities and drawbacks of NLP alongside its future implications. We searched the PubMed and Embase databases with a \"natural language processing\" and \"epilepsy\" query (March 4, 2022) and included original research articles describing the application of NLP techniques for textual analysis in epilepsy. Twenty-six studies were included. Fifty-eight percent of these studies used NLP to classify clinical records into predefined categories, improving patient identification and treatment decisions. Other applications of NLP had structured clinical information retrieval from electronic health records, scientific papers, and online posts of patients. Challenges and opportunities of NLP applications for enhancing epilepsy care and research are discussed. The field could further benefit from NLP by replicating successes in other health care domains, such as NLP-aided quality evaluation for clinical decision-making, outcome prediction, and clinical record summarization.", "Education and training are needed for nursing students using artificial intelligence-based educational programs. However, few studies have assessed the effect of using chatbots in nursing education.\nThis study aimed to develop and examine the effect of an artificial intelligence chatbot educational program for promoting nursing skills related to electronic fetal monitoring in nursing college students during non-face-to-face classes during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis quasi-experimental study used a nonequivalent control group non-synchronized pretest-posttest design.\nThe participants were 61 junior students from a nursing college located in G province of South Korea. Data were collected between November 3 and 16, 2021, and analyzed using independent t-tests.\nThe experimental group-in which the artificial intelligence chatbot program was applied-did not show statistically significant differences in knowledge (t\u2009=\u2009-0.58, p\u2009=\u2009.567), clinical reasoning competency (t\u2009=\u20090.75, p\u2009=\u2009.455), confidence (t\u2009=\u20091.13, p\u2009=\u2009.264), and feedback satisfaction (t\u2009=\u20091.72, p\u2009=\u2009.090), compared with the control group; however, its participants' interest in education (t\u2009=\u20092.38, p\u2009=\u2009.020) and self-directed learning (t\u2009=\u20092.72, p\u2009=\u2009.006) were significantly higher than those in the control group.\nThe findings of our study highlighted the potential of artificial intelligence chatbot programs as an educational assistance tool to promote nursing college students' interest in education and self-directed learning. Moreover, such programs can be effective in enhancing nursing students' skills in non-face-to face-situations caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.", "Multibeam forward-looking sonar (MFLS) plays an important role in underwater detection. There are several challenges to the research on underwater object detection with MFLS. Firstly, the research is lack of available dataset. Secondly, the sonar image, generally processed at pixel level and transformed to sector representation for the visual habits of human beings, is disadvantageous to the research in artificial intelligence (AI) areas. Towards these challenges, we present a novel dataset, the underwater acoustic target detection (UATD) dataset, consisting of over 9000 MFLS images captured using Tritech Gemini 1200ik sonar. Our dataset provides raw data of sonar images with annotation of 10 categories of target objects (cube, cylinder, tyres, etc). The data was collected from lake and shallow water. To verify the practicality of UATD, we apply the dataset to the state-of-the-art detectors and provide corresponding benchmarks for its accuracy and efficiency.", "Physical rehabilitation techniques during the treatment of clinical pathology are one of the most challenging areas for the medical structure, patients, and families. In large and continental countries, remote monitoring of this treatment is essential. However, equipment and medical follow-up during exercises still have high costs. With the improvement of computer vision and machine learning techniques, some computational, less expensive alternatives have been proposed in the literature. However, monitoring patients during physical rehabilitation exercises with the help of artificial intelligence by a health professional, especially from the capture of visual signals, is still a challenge and poorly explored in the scientific-technological literature. This work aims to propose a new methodology based on computer vision and machine learning for remote tracking of the body joints of patients during physiotherapy rehabilitation exercises. As a new contribution, this work presents a modular neural network architecture composed of two modules: one for detecting physical exercises and another for measuring how much is correct. Another contribution is a strategy for expanding databases, considering that generic databases for this type of exercise are rare on the internet. The results showed that both modules obtained more than 90% of accuracy in recognition and their respective validation.", "Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been an indispensable and widely used diagnostic tool in several medical fields, including gastroenterology, cardiology, and urology, due to its diverse therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Many studies show that it is effective and safe in patients with liver conditions where conventional endoscopy or cross-sectional imaging are inefficient or when surgical interventions pose high risks. In this article, we present a review of the current literature for the different diagnostic and therapeutic applications of EUS in liver diseases and their complications and discuss the potential future application of artificial intelligence analysis of EUS.", "Emotional intelligence and, in particular, the component emotion regulation may increase well-being and improve mood and coping with negative emotions. In the present eye-tracking study, we examined whether attention allocation to positive stimuli mediates the relationship between emotion regulation abilities and trait affect. Gaze behavior of 104 healthy adults was analyzed in a free-viewing task, in which happy, sad, angry, and neutral faces were shown simultaneously for ten seconds. Dwell time on facial expressions was used as indicator of attention allocation. Trait emotional intelligence was assessed using the Self-Rated Emotional Intelligence Scale. Self-report measures of state and trait positive and negative affect, trait anxiety, and depression were administered. In general, participants viewed longer at happy than at negative or neutral faces. The results of mediation analyses indicated that intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulation abilities were indirectly related to trait positive affect through attention to happy faces. Moreover, dwell time on happy faces had a mediating effect on the relationship between interpersonal emotion regulation ability and trait anxiety. Preference for positive social signals might form one attentional pathway through which emotion regulation abilities promote positive mood and buffer the development of anxiety reactions in everyday life.", "Few-shot learning (learning with a few samples) is one of the most important cognitive abilities of the human brain. However, the current artificial intelligence systems meet difficulties in achieving this ability. Similar challenges also exist for biologically plausible spiking neural networks (SNNs). Datasets for traditional few-shot learning domains provide few amounts of temporal information. And the absence of neuromorphic datasets has hindered the development of few-shot learning for SNNs. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first neuromorphic dataset for few-shot learning using SNNs: N-Omniglot, based on the Dynamic Vision Sensor. It contains 1,623 categories of handwritten characters, with only 20 samples per class. N-Omniglot eliminates the need for a neuromorphic dataset for SNNs with high spareness and tremendous temporal coherence. Additionally, the dataset provides a powerful challenge and a suitable benchmark for developing SNNs algorithms in the few-shot learning domain due to the chronological information of strokes. We also provide the improved nearest neighbor, convolutional network, SiameseNet, and meta-learning algorithm in the\u00a0spiking version for verification.", "The COVID-19 pandemic and the high numbers of infected individuals pose major challenges for public health departments. To overcome these challenges, the health department in Cologne has developed a software called DiKoMa. This software offers the possibility to track contact and index persons, but also provides a digital symptom diary. In this work, the question of whether these can also be used for diagnostic purposes will be investigated. Machine learning makes it possible to identify infections based on early symptom profiles and to distinguish between the predominant dominant variants. Focusing on the occurrence of the symptoms in the first week, a decision tree is trained for the differentiation between contact and index persons and the prevailing dominant variants (Wildtype, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron). The model is evaluated, using sex- and age-stratified cross-validation and validated by symptom profiles of the first 6 days. The variants achieve an AUC-ROC from 0.89 for Omicron and 0.6 for Alpha. No significant differences are observed for the results of the validation set (Alpha 0.63 and Omicron 0.87). The evaluation of symptom combinations using artificial intelligence can determine the individual risk for the presence of a COVID-19 infection, allows assignment to virus variants, and can contribute to the management of epidemics and pandemics on a national and international level. It can help to reduce the number of specific tests in times of low labor capacity and could help to early identify new virus variants.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) research began in theoretical neurophysiology, and the resulting classical paper on the McCulloch-Pitts mathematical neuron was written in a psychiatry department almost 80\u2009years ago. However, the application of AI in digital neuropathology is still in its infancy. Rapid progress is now being made, which prompted this article. Human brain diseases represent distinct system states that fall outside the normal spectrum. Many differ not only in functional but also in structural terms, and the morphology of abnormal nervous tissue forms the traditional basis of neuropathological disease classifications. However, only a few countries have the medical specialty of neuropathology, and, given the sheer number of newly developed histological tools that can be applied to the study of brain diseases, a tremendous shortage of qualified hands and eyes at the microscope is obvious. Similarly, in neuroanatomy, human observers no longer have the capacity to process the vast amounts of connectomics data. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that advances in AI technology and, especially, whole-slide image (WSI) analysis will greatly aid neuropathological practice. In this paper, we discuss machine learning (ML) techniques that are important for understanding WSI analysis, such as traditional ML and deep learning, introduce a recently developed neuropathological AI termed PathoFusion, and present thoughts on some of the challenges that must be overcome before the full potential of AI in digital neuropathology can be realized.", "The combination of polarized imaging with artificial intelligence (AI) technology has provided a powerful tool for performing an objective and precise diagnosis in medicine.\nAn approach is proposed for the detection of hepatitis B (HB) virus using a combined Mueller matrix imaging technique and deep learning method.\nIn the proposed approach, Mueller matrix imaging polarimetry is applied to obtain 4 \u00d7 4  Mueller matrix images of 138 HBsAg-containing (positive) serum samples and 136 HBsAg-free (negative) serum samples. The kernel estimation density results show that, of the 16 Mueller matrix elements, elements  M 22   and  M 33   provide the best discriminatory power between the positive and negative samples.\nAs a result,  M 22   and  M 33   are taken as the inputs to five different deep learning models: Xception, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet 50, and ResNet150. It is shown that the optimal classification accuracy (94.5%) is obtained using the VGG19 model with element  M 22   as the input.\nOverall, the results confirm that the proposed hybrid Mueller matrix imaging and AI framework provides a simple and effective approach for HB virus detection.", "Nowadays, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, conductive hydrogel-based sensors play an increasingly vital role in health monitoring and temperature sensing. However, the perfect integration of the environmental stability and applied performance of the hydrogel has always been a challenging and significant problem. Herein, we report an environmentally tolerant, stretchable, adhesive, self-healing conductive gel through multiple dynamic interactions in the water/glycerol/ionic liquids medium, which can be used as a high-performance strain and temperature sensor. The random copolymer poly(acrylic acid-co-acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate) interacts with the branched poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) and Zr4+ ions via the dynamic covalent enamine bonds, coordinations, and electrostatic interactions to improve stretchable (1300%), compressible, fatigue-resistant (1000 cycles at 50% strain), and self-healing performance (95%, 24 h). The combination of water/glycerol/ionic liquids imparts the resulting gel with excellent electrical conductivity, anti-drying, and anti-freezing performance. By means of the above excellent performance, the gel could be used as the flexible strain or pressure sensor with high sensitivity and stability for the detection of the movement, expression, handwriting, pronouncing, and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in various models. Meanwhile, the resulting gel can be assembled as the temperature sensor to trace the change of temperature accurately and steadily, which has a wide operating window (0 to 100 \u00b0C), an ultralow detection limit (0.2 \u00b0C), and high sensitivity (2.1% \u00b0C-1). It is believed that the strategy for the multifunction and high-performance gel will blaze a new trail for the smart device in health management, temperature detection, and information transmission under various environmental conditions.", "To evaluate the accuracy of predicting the risk of developing pre-eclampsia (PE) according to first-trimester maternal demographic characteristics, medical history and biomarkers using artificial-intelligence and machine-learning methods.\nThe data were derived from prospective non-interventional screening for PE at 11-13\u2009weeks' gestation at two maternity hospitals in the UK. The data were divided into three subsets. The first set, including 30\u2009437 subjects, was used to develop the training process, the second set of 10\u2009000 subjects was utilized to optimize the machine-learning hyperparameters and the third set of 20\u2009352 subjects was coded and used for model validation. An artificial neural network was used to predict from the demographic characteristics and medical history the prior risk that was then combined with biomarker values to determine the risk of PE and preterm PE with delivery at <\u200937\u2009weeks' gestation. An additional network was trained without including race as input. Biomarkers included uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), placental growth factor (PlGF) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A. All markers were entered using raw values without conversion into standardized multiples of the median. The prediction accuracy was estimated using the area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC). We further computed the detection rate at 10%, 20% and 40% false-positive rates (FPR). The impact of taking aspirin was also added. Shapley values were calculated to evaluate the contribution of each parameter to the prediction of risk. We used a non-parametric test to compare the expected AUC with the one obtained when we randomly scrambled the labels and kept the predictions. For the general prediction, we performed 10\u2009000 permutations of the labels. When the AUC was higher than the one obtained in all 10\u2009000 permutations, we reported a P-value of <\u20090.0001. For the race-specific analysis, we performed 1000 permutations. When the AUC was higher than the AUC in permutations, we reported a P-value of <\u20090.001.\nThe detection rate for preterm PE vs no PE, at a 10% FPR, was 53.3% when screening by maternal factors only, and the corresponding AUC was 0.816; these increased to 75.3% and 0.909, respectively, with the addition of biomarkers into the model. Information on race was important for the prediction accuracy; when race was not used to train the model, at a 10% FPR, the detection rate of preterm PE vs no PE decreased to 34.5-45.5% (for different races) when screening by maternal factors only and to 55.0-62.1% when biomarkers were added. The major predictors of PE were high MAP and UtA-PI, and low PlGF. The accuracy of prediction of all PE cases was lower than that for preterm PE. Aspirin use was recommended for cases who were at high risk of preterm PE. The AUC of all PE vs no PE was 0.770 when screening by maternal factors and 0.817 when the biomarkers were added; the respective detection rates, at a 10% FPR, were 41.3% and 52.9%.\nScreening for PE using a non-linear machine-learning-based approach does not require a population-based normalization, and its performance is similar to that of logistic regression. Removing race information from the model reduces its prediction accuracy, especially for the non-white populations when only maternal factors are considered. \u00a9 2022 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.", "When introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical care, one of the main objectives is to improve workflow efficiency because AI-based solutions are expected to take over or support routine tasks.\nThis study sought to synthesize the current knowledge base on how the use of AI technologies for medical imaging affects efficiency and what facilitators or barriers moderating the impact of AI implementation have been reported.\nIn this systematic literature review, comprehensive literature searches will be performed in relevant electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and CENTRAL.

Furthermore, a narrative synthesis approach that focuses on work system factors affecting the integration of AI technologies reported in eligible studies will be adopted.\nThis review is anticipated to begin in September 2022 and will be completed in April 2023.\nThis systematic review and synthesis aims to summarize the existing knowledge on efficiency improvements in medical imaging through the integration of AI into clinical workflows. Moreover, it will extract the facilitators and barriers of the AI implementation process in clinical care settings. Therefore, our findings have implications for future clinical implementation processes of AI-based solutions, with a particular focus on diagnostic procedures. This review is additionally expected to identify research gaps regarding the focus on seamless workflow integration of novel technologies in clinical settings.\nPROSPERO CRD42022303439; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=303439.\nPRR1-10.2196/40485.", "The availability of accurate and fast artificial intelligence (AI) solutions predicting aspects of proteins are revolutionizing experimental and computational molecular biology. The webserver LambdaPP aspires to supersede PredictProtein, the first internet server making AI protein predictions available in 1992. Given a protein sequence as input, LambdaPP provides easily accessible visualizations of protein 3D structure, along with predictions at the protein level (GeneOntology, subcellular location), and the residue level (binding to metal ions, small molecules, and nucleotides; conservation; intrinsic disorder; secondary structure; alpha-helical and beta-barrel transmembrane segments; signal-peptides; variant effect) in seconds. The structure prediction provided by LambdaPP-leveraging ColabFold and computed in minutes-is based on MMseqs2 multiple sequence alignments. All other feature prediction methods are based on the pLM ProtT5.

While no definitive methods of diagnosis or treatment exist for either disease, researchers have implemented machine learning algorithms with neuroimaging and motion-tracking technology to analyze pathologically relevant symptoms and biomarkers. Deep learning algorithms such as neural networks and complex combined architectures have proven capable of tracking disease-linked changes in brain structure and physiology as well as patient motor and cognitive symptoms and responses to treatment. However, such techniques require further development aimed at improving transparency, adaptability, and reproducibility.

Peer mentoring has the potential to ameliorate these challenges.\nThe aim of this study was to understand, from both the mentee and potential mentor perspective, the needs, expectations, and concerns of AYAs regarding peer mentoring to inform the development of social media-based peer mentoring interventions for e-cigarette cessation among AYAs.\nSeven focus groups, including four mentee groups and three potential mentor groups, were conducted with 26 AYAs who had prior experience with e-cigarette use and attempts to quit in the context of a social media-based e-cigarette cessation intervention. Discussion focused on preferred characteristics of peer mentors, expectations about peer mentoring, mentoring mode, mentor training, incentives for peer mentors, preferred social media platforms for intervention delivery, supervision, and concerns. Focus group transcripts were coded and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach.\nOverall, participants were receptive to peer mentoring in social media-based cessation interventions and believed they could be helpful in assisting e-cigarette cessation. Participants identified the most important characteristics of peer mentors to be of similar age and to be abstinent from e-cigarette use. Participants expected peer mentors would share personal experiences, provide emotional support, and send check-ins and reminders. Peer mentors supporting a group of mentees in combination with one-on-one mentoring as needed was the preferred mentoring mode. A group of 10 mentees with a mentor:mentee ratio of 1:3-5 was deemed acceptable for most participants. Participants expressed that mentor training should include emotional intelligence, communication skills, and the scientific evidence about e-cigarettes. Although monetary incentives were not the main motivating factor for being a peer mentor, they were viewed as a good way to compensate mentors' time. Instagram was considered an appropriate social media platform to deliver a peer-mentored intervention due to its functionality. Participants did not express many privacy concerns about social media-based peer mentoring, but mentioned that boundaries and community agreements should be set to keep relationships professional.\nThis study reflects the needs and preferences of young people for a peer mentoring intervention to complement a social media program to support e-cigarette cessation. The next step will be to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of such a peer mentoring program.", "Rapid development of biotechnology has led to the generation of vast amounts of multi-omics data, necessitating the advancement of bioinformatics and artificial intelligence to enable computational modeling to diagnose and predict clinical outcome. Both conventional machine learning and new deep learning algorithms screen existing data unbiasedly to uncover patterns and create models that can be valuable in informing clinical decisions. We summarized published literature on the use of AI models trained on omics datasets, with and without clinical data, to diagnose, risk-stratify, and predict survivability of patients with non-malignant liver diseases. A total of 20 different models were tested in selected studies. Generally, the addition of omics data to regular clinical parameters or individual biomarkers improved the AI model performance. For instance, using NAFLD fibrosis score to distinguish F0-F2 from F3-F4 fibrotic stages, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.87. When integrating metabolomic data by a GMLVQ model, the AUC drastically improved to 0.99. The use of RF on multi-omics and clinical data in another study to predict progression of NAFLD to NASH resulted in an AUC of 0.84, compared to 0.82 when using clinical data only. A comparison of RF, SVM and kNN models on genomics data to classify immune tolerant phase in chronic hepatitis B resulted in AUC of 0.8793-0.8838 compared to 0.6759-0.7276 when using various serum biomarkers. Overall, the integration of omics was shown to improve prediction performance compared to models built only on clinical parameters, indicating a potential use for personalized medicine in clinical setting.", "From the emotional perspective, this study explores how team leader's conflict management styles affect team passion. A theoretical model is constructed which describes the mediating role of positive team emotional climate and the moderating impact of team emotional intelligence. We collect 101 teams paired data including 101 team leaders and 383 team members to test theoretical model. It is shown that leader's cooperative conflict management style has a significant positive effect on both positive team emotional climate and team passion. Meanwhile, positive team emotional climate plays a mediating role between leader's cooperative conflict management style and team passion. In addition, team emotional intelligence has a moderating effect between leader's cooperative style and positive team emotional climate. This study not only provides a new perspective for follow-up research but also expands the research scope of impacts of conflict management styles. In addition, this study forms the underlying mechanism of team leader's conflict management styles on team passion from the emotional perspective and investigates the mediating effect and moderating effect of emotional variable, which broadens the research on the mechanisms of conflict management styles on team outcomes to a certain extent.", "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a mathematical framework of neural learning by trial and error that revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. However, until now, RL has been implemented in algorithms with the compatibly of traditional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-based von Neumann digital platforms, which thus limits performance in terms of latency, fault tolerance, and robustness. Here, we demonstrate that nanocolumnar (\u223c12 nm) HfO2 structures can be used as building blocks to conduct the RL within the material by combining its stress-adjustable charge transport and memory functions. Specifically, HfO2 nanostructures grown by the sputtering method exhibit self-assembled vertical nanocolumnar structures that generate voltage depending on the impact of stress under self-biased conditions. The observed results are attributed to the flexoelectric-like response of HfO2. Further, multilevel current (>10-3 A) modulation with touch and controlled suspension (\u223c10-12 A) with a short electric pulse (100 ms) were demonstrated, yielding a proof-of-concept memory with an on/off ratio greater than 109. Utilizing multipattern dynamic memory and tactile sensing, RL was implemented to successfully solve a maze game using an array of 6 \u00d7 4. This work could pave the way to do RL within materials for a variety of applications such as memory storage, neuromorphic sensors, smart robots, and human-machine interaction systems.", "Histopathological identification is usually required since the sensitivity of fungal culture is not sufficient for accurate diagnosis. On the other hand, pathological diagnosis, especially of molds, often is not accurate, even when performed by an experienced pathologist. This is particularly true in the differentiation between mucormycosis and aspergillosis, which have different drugs of choice and medical management. The diseases can easily become severe in a short period of time in accordance with the severity of the underlying disease or predisposing factors. Therefore, correct diagnosis is extremely important and should be entrusted to the pathologist.\nTo develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated histological diagnostic system for mold infection to support the diagnosis by general pathologists, especially for distinguishing between Aspergillus and Mucorales.\nWe used two indicators for the diagnostic system; namely, the angle of independent hyphae and tortuosity of each hypha.\nWe collected 147 and 67 image samples respectively from standard cases of aspergillosis and mucormycosis. All the images were successfully analyzed by automatic recognition of the two indicators. The independent areas divided by the threshold curve generated by two-dimensional plots of the data clearly include the test data obtained from the cases of Aspergillus and Mucorales. The present study demonstrates the usefulness of our newly developed AI-based diagnostic system. Further investigation is required for its practical use.", "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable psychiatric illness exhibiting substantial correlation with intelligence.\nTo investigate the shared genetic signatures between BD and intelligence, we utilized the summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to conduct the bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR) and conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) analyses. Subsequent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping in human brain and enrichment analyses were also performed.\nAnalysis with MiXeR suggested that approximately 10.3K variants could influence intelligence, among which 7.6K variants were correlated with the risk of BD (Dice: 0.80), and 47% of these variants predicted BD risk and intelligence in consistent allelic directions. The conjFDR analysis identified 37 distinct genomic loci that were jointly associated with BD and intelligence with a conjFDR < 0.01, and 16 loci (43%) had the same directions of allelic effects in both phenotypes. Brain eQTL analyses found that genes affected by the \"concordant loci\" were distinct from those modulated by the \"discordant loci\". Enrichment analyses suggested that genes related to the \"concordant loci\" were significantly enriched in pathways/phenotypes related with synapses and sleep quality, whereas genes associated with the \"discordant loci\" were enriched in pathways related to cell adhesion, calcium ion binding, and abnormal emotional phenotypes.\nWe confirmed the polygenic overlap with mixed directions of allelic effects between BD and intelligence and identified multiple genomic loci and risk genes. This study provides hints for the mesoscopic phenotypes of BD and relevant biological mechanisms, promoting the knowledge of the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of BD. The essential value of leveraging intelligence in BD investigations is also highlighted.", "Early recognition of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) by ambulance service call centre operators is important so that cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be delivered immediately, but around 25% of OHCAs are not picked up by call centre operators. An artificial intelligence (AI) system has been developed to support call centre operators in the detection of OHCA. The study aims to (1) explore ambulance service stakeholder perceptions on the safety of OHCA AI decision support in call centres, and (2) develop a clinical safety case for the OHCA AI decision-support system.\nThe study will be undertaken within the Welsh Ambulance Service. The study is part research and part service evaluation. The research utilises a qualitative study design based on thematic analysis of interview data. The service evaluation consists of the development of a clinical safety case based on document analysis, analysis of the AI model and its development process and informal interviews with the technology developer.\nAI presents many opportunities for ambulance services, but safety assurance requirements need to be understood. The ASSIST project will continue to explore and build the body of knowledge in this area.", "Lateral cephalograms and related analysis constitute representative methods for orthodontic treatment. However, since conventional cephalometric radiographs display a three-dimensional structure on a two-dimensional plane, inaccuracies may be produced when quantitative evaluation is required. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has minimal image distortion, and important parts can be observed without overlapping. It provides a high-resolution three-dimensional image at a relatively low dose and cost, but still shows a higher dose than a lateral cephalogram. It is especially true for children who are more susceptible to radiation doses and often have difficult diagnoses. A conventional lateral cephalometric radiograph can be obtained by reconstructing the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine data obtained from CBCT. This study evaluated the applicability and consistency of lateral cephalograms generated by CBCT using an artificial intelligence analysis program. Group I comprised conventional lateral cephalometric radiographs, group II comprised lateral cephalometric radiographs generated from CBCT using OnDemand 3D, and group III comprised lateral cephalometric radiographs generated from CBCT using Invivo5. All measurements in the three groups showed non-significant results. Therefore, a CBCT scan and artificial intelligence programs are efficient means when performing orthodontic analysis on pediatric or orthodontic patients for orthodontic diagnosis and planning.", "The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review for understanding the availability and limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that could automatically identify and quantify computed tomography (CT) findings in traumatic brain injury (TBI).\nSystematic review, in accordance with PRISMA 2020 and SPIRIT-AI extension guidelines, with a search of 4 databases (Medline, Embase, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science) was performed to find AI studies that automated the clinical tasks for identifying and quantifying CT findings of TBI-related abnormalities.\nA total of 531 unique publications were reviewed, which resulted in 66 articles that met our inclusion criteria. The following components for identification and quantification regarding TBI were covered and automated by existing AI studies: identification of TBI-related abnormalities; classification of intracranial hemorrhage types; slice-, pixel-, and voxel-level localization of hemorrhage; measurement of midline shift; and measurement of hematoma volume. Automated identification of obliterated basal cisterns was not investigated in the existing AI studies. Most of the AI algorithms were based on deep neural networks that were trained on 2- or 3-dimensional CT imaging datasets.\nWe identified several important TBI-related CT findings that can be automatically identified and quantified with AI. A combination of these techniques may provide useful tools to enhance reproducibility of TBI identification and quantification by supporting radiologists and clinicians in their TBI assessments and reducing subjective human factors.", "Recent advancements of artificial intelligence based on deep learning algorithms have made it possible to computationally predict compound-protein interaction (CPI) without conducting laboratory experiments. In this manuscript, we integrated a graph attention network (GAT) for compounds and a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) for proteins, used end-to-end representation learning for both compounds and proteins, and proposed a deep learning algorithm, CPGL (CPI with GAT and LSTM) to optimize the feature extraction from compounds and proteins and to improve the model robustness and generalizability. CPGL demonstrated an excellent predictive performance and outperforms recently reported deep learning models. Based on 3 public CPI datasets, C.elegans, Human and BindingDB, CPGL represented 1 - 5% improvement compared to existing deep-learning models. Our method also achieves excellent results on datasets with imbalanced positive and negative proportions constructed based on the C.elegans and Human datasets. More importantly, using 2 label reversal datasets, GPCR and Kinase, CPGL showed superior performance compared to other existing deep learning models. The AUC were substantially improved by 20% on the Kinase dataset, indicative of the robustness and generalizability of CPGL.", "Extreme events in society and nature, such as pandemic spikes, rogue waves or structural failures, can have catastrophic consequences. Characterizing extremes is difficult, as they occur rarely, arise from seemingly benign conditions, and belong to complex and often unknown infinite-dimensional systems. Such challenges render attempts at characterizing them moot. We address each of these difficulties by combining output-weighted training schemes in Bayesian experimental design (BED) with an ensemble of deep neural operators. This model-agnostic framework pairs a BED scheme that actively selects data for quantifying extreme events with an ensemble of deep neural operators that approximate infinite-dimensional nonlinear operators. We show that not only does this framework outperform Gaussian processes, but that (1) shallow ensembles of just two members perform best; (2) extremes are uncovered regardless of the state of the initial data (that is, with or without extremes); (3) our method eliminates 'double-descent' phenomena; (4) the use of batches of suboptimal acquisition samples compared to step-by-step global optima does not hinder BED performance; and (5) Monte Carlo acquisition outperforms standard optimizers in high dimensions. Together, these conclusions form a scalable artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted experimental infrastructure that can efficiently infer and pinpoint critical situations across many domains, from physical to societal systems.", "Complex traits show clear patterns of tissue-specific expression influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), yet current strategies aggregate SNP effects to genes by employing simple physical proximity-based windows. Here, we examined whether incorporating SNPs with effects on tissue-specific cis-expression would improve our ability to detect trait-relevant tissues across 31 complex traits using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression (S-LDSC). We found that a physical proximity annotation produced more significant tissue enrichments and larger S-LDSC regression coefficients, as compared to an expression-based annotation. Furthermore, we showed that our expression-based annotation did not outperform an annotation strategy in which an equal number of randomly chosen SNPs were annotated to genes within the same genomic window, suggesting extensive redundancy among SNP effect estimates due to linkage disequilibrium. That said, current sample sizes limit estimation of cis-genetic SNP effects; therefore, we recommend reexamination of the expression-based annotation when larger tissue-specific expression datasets become available. To examine the influence of sample size, we used a large whole blood eQTL reference panel (N\u2009=\u200931,684) applying a similar expression-based annotation strategy. We found that significant cis-expression QTLs in whole blood did not outperform the physical proximity annotation when estimating tissue-specific SNP heritability enrichment for either high- or low-density lipoprotein phenotypes but performed similarly for inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, we report new and updated tissue enrichment estimates across 31 complex traits, such as significant heritability enrichment of the frontal cortex for cognitive performance, educational attainment, and intelligence, providing further evidence of this structure's importance in higher cognitive function.", "Factors that increase estrogen or progesterone (P4) action are well-established as increasing breast cancer risk, and many first-line treatments to prevent breast cancer recurrence work by blocking estrogen synthesis or action. In previous work, using data from an in vitro steroidogenesis assay developed for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ToxCast program, we identified 182 chemicals that increased estradiol (E2up) and 185 that increased progesterone (P4up) in human H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells, an OECD validated assay for steroidogenesis. Chemicals known to induce mammary effects in vivo were very likely to increase E2 or P4 synthesis, further supporting the importance of these pathways for breast cancer. To identify additional chemical exposures that may increase breast cancer risk through E2 or P4 steroidogenesis, we developed a cheminformatics approach to identify structural features associated with these activities and to predict other E2 or P4 steroidogens from their chemical structures. First, we used molecular descriptors and physicochemical properties to cluster the 2,012 chemicals screened in the steroidogenesis assay using a self-organizing map (SOM). Structural features such as triazine, phenol, or more broadly benzene ramified with halide, amine or alcohol, are enriched for E2 or P4up chemicals. Among E2up chemicals, phenol and benzenone are found as significant substructures, along with nitrogen-containing biphenyls. For P4up chemicals, phenol and complex aromatic systems ramified with oxygen-based groups such as flavone or phenolphthalein are significant substructures. Chemicals that are active for both E2up and P4up are enriched with substructures such as dihydroxy phosphanedithione or are small chemicals that contain one benzene ramified with chlorine, alcohol, methyl or primary amine. These results are confirmed with a chemotype ToxPrint analysis. Then, we used machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to develop and validate predictive classification QSAR models for E2up and P4up chemicals. These models gave reasonable external prediction performances (balanced accuracy\u2009~\u20090.8 and Matthews Coefficient Correlation\u2009~\u20090.5) on an external validation. The QSAR models were enriched by adding a confidence score that considers the chemical applicability domain and a ToxPrint assessment of the chemical. This profiling and these models may be useful to direct future testing and risk assessments for chemicals related to breast cancer and other hormonally-mediated outcomes.", "Identifying chemical odors rapidly and accurately is critical in a variety of fields. Due to the limited human sense of smell, much effort has been dedicated to the development of electronic sensing devices. Despite some recent progress, such devices are still no match for the capabilities of biological (animal) olfactory sensors, which are light, robust, versatile, and sensitive. Consequently, scientists are turning to a new approach: Bio-Hybrid sensors. These sensors combine animal biological sensors with electronic components to achieve maximum detection and classification while conveying a comprehensible signal to the end user. In this work, we created a bio-hybrid odor discriminator utilizing the desert locust's primary olfactory apparatus - its antennae, together with simple electroantennogram technology and artificial intelligence tools for signal analysis. Our discriminator is able to differentiate between at least eight pure odors and two mixtures of different odorants, independently of odorant concentration. With four orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, it is able to detect the presence of less than 1\u00a0ng of volatile compounds and, compared to other bio-hybrid sensors available today, it can be easily operated by an unskilled individual. This study thus opens up the future for robust and simple bio-hybrid robotic sensing devices that can be widely deployed.", "Anomaly detection has wide applications in machine intelligence but is still a difficult unsolved problem. Major challenges include the rarity of labeled anomalies and it is a class highly imbalanced problem. Traditional unsupervised anomaly detectors are suboptimal while supervised models can easily make biased predictions towards normal data. In this paper, we present a new supervised anomaly detector through introducing the novel Ensemble Active Learning Generative Adversarial Network (EAL-GAN). EAL-GAN is a conditional GAN having a unique one generator versus multiple discriminators architecture where anomaly detection is implemented by an auxiliary classifier of the discriminator. In addition to using the conditional GAN to generate class balanced supplementary training data, an innovative ensemble learning loss function ensuring each discriminator makes up for the deficiencies of the others is designed to overcome the class imbalanced problem, and an active learning algorithm is introduced to significantly reduce the cost of labeling real-world data. We present extensive experimental results to demonstrate that the new anomaly detector consistently outperforms a variety of SOTA methods by significant margins.", "Parkinson's disease (PD) demonstrates neurodegenerative changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) using neuromelanin-sensitive (NM)-MRI. As SNc manual segmentation is prone to substantial inter-individual variability across raters, development of a robust automatic segmentation framework is necessary to facilitate nigral neuromelanin quantification. Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining traction in the neuroimaging community for automated brain region segmentation tasks using MRI.\nDeveloping and validating AI-based NigraNet, a fully automatic SNc segmentation framework allowing nigral neuromelanin quantification in patients with PD using NM-MRI.\nWe prospectively included 199 participants comprising 144 early-stage idiopathic PD patients (disease duration\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0years) and 55 healthy volunteers (HV) scanned using a 3 Tesla MRI including whole brain T1-weighted anatomical imaging and NM-MRI. The regions of interest (ROI) were delineated in all participants automatically using NigraNet, a modified U-net, and compared to manual segmentations performed by two experienced raters. The SNc volumes (Vol), volumes corrected by total intracranial volume (Cvol), normalized signal intensity (NSI) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were computed. One-way GLM-ANCOVA was performed while adjusting for age and sex as covariates. Diagnostic performance measurement was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Inter and intra-observer variability were estimated using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The agreements between methods were tested using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) based on a mean-rating, two-way, mixed-effects model estimates for absolute agreement. Cronbach's alpha and Bland-Altman plots were estimated to assess inter-method consistency.\nUsing both methods, Vol, Cvol, NSI and CNR measurements differed between PD and HV with an effect of sex for Cvol and CNR. ICC values between the methods demonstrated optimal agreement for Cvol and CNR (ICC\u00a0>\u00a00.9) and high reproducibility (DSC: 0.80) was also obtained. The SNc measurements also showed good to excellent consistency values (Cronbach's alpha\u00a0>\u00a00.87). Bland-Altman plots of agreement demonstrated no association of SNc ROI measurement differences between the methods and ROI average measurements while confirming that 95\u00a0% of the data points were ranging between the limits of mean difference (d\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.96xSD). Percentage changes between PD and HV were -27.4\u00a0% and -17.7\u00a0% for Vol, -30.0\u00a0% and -22.2\u00a0% for Cvol, -15.8\u00a0% and -14.4\u00a0% for NSI, -17.1\u00a0% and -16.0\u00a0% for CNR for automatic and manual measurements respectively. Using automatic method, in the entire dataset, we obtained the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.83 for Vol, 0.85 for Cvol, 0.79 for NSI and 0.77 for CNR whereas in the training dataset of 0.96 for Vol, 0.95 for Cvol, 0.85 for NSI and 0.85 for CNR. Disease duration correlated negatively with NSI of the patients for both the automatic and manual measurements.\nWe presented an AI-based NigraNet framework that utilizes a small MRI training dataset to fully automatize the SNc segmentation procedure with an increased precision and more reproducible results. Considering the consistency, accuracy and speed of our approach, this study could be a crucial step towards the implementation of a time-saving non-rater dependent fully automatic method for studying neuromelanin changes in clinical settings and large-scale neuroimaging studies.", "We introduce DeepNash, an autonomous agent that plays the imperfect information game Stratego at a human expert level. Stratego is one of the few iconic board games that artificial intelligence (AI) has not yet mastered. It is a game characterized by a twin challenge: It requires long-term strategic thinking as in chess, but it also requires dealing with imperfect information as in poker. The technique underpinning DeepNash uses a game-theoretic, model-free deep reinforcement learning method, without search, that learns to master Stratego through self-play from scratch. DeepNash beat existing state-of-the-art AI methods in Stratego and achieved a year-to-date (2022) and all-time top-three ranking on the Gravon games platform, competing with human expert players.", "Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, while on the run, purportedly burned two million dollars in banknotes to keep his daughter warm. A stark reminder that, in life, circumstances and goals can quickly change, forcing us to reassess and modify our values on-the-fly. Studies in decision-making and neuroeconomics have often implicitly equated value to reward, emphasising the hedonic and automatic aspect of the value computation, while overlooking its functional (concept-like) nature. Here we outline the computational and biological principles that enable the brain to compute the usefulness of an option or action by creating abstractions that flexibly adapt to changing goals. We present different algorithmic architectures, comparing ideas from artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive neuroscience with psychological theories and, when possible, drawing parallels.", "A growth mindset refers to an individual's beliefs about the malleable nature of intelligence. It plays an important role in motivation and achievement. However, few studies have examined the brain mechanisms involved in the growth mindset. In this study, voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the relationship between growth mindset and gray matter volume (GMV) in healthy adults' sample from 114 men and 275 women who completed the Growth Mindset Inventory and intelligence test and underwent an anatomical magnetic resonance imaging scan. Whole-brain correlation analyses showed a positive relationship between growth mindset scores and regional GMV of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) after controlling for age, sex, and total intracranial volume. This result was robust after controlling for intelligence quotient. The mOFC was primarily related to reward processing, supporting the social-cognitive theory of motivation on growth mindset.", "Many Information Retrieval (IR) approaches have been proposed to extract relevant information from a large corpus. Among these methods, phrase-based retrieval methods have been proven to capture more concrete and concise information than word-based and paragraph-based methods. However, due to the complex relationship among phrases and a lack of proper visual guidance, achieving user-driven interactive information-seeking and retrieval remains challenging. In this study, we present a visual analytic approach for users to seek information from an extensive collection of documents efficiently. The main component of our approach is a PhraseMap, where nodes and edges represent the extracted keyphrases and their relationships, respectively, from a large corpus. To build the PhraseMap, we extract keyphrases from each document and link the phrases according to word attention determined using modern language models, i.e., BERT. As can be imagined, the graph is complex due to the extensive volume of information and the massive amount of relationships. Therefore, we develop a navigation algorithm to facilitate information seeking. It includes (1) a question-answering (QA) model to identify phrases related to users' queries and (2) updating relevant phrases based on users' feedback. To better present the PhraseMap, we introduce a resource-controlled self-organizing map (RC-SOM) to evenly and regularly display phrases on grid cells while expecting phrases with similar semantics to stay close in the visualization. To evaluate our approach, we conducted case studies with three domain experts in diverse literature. The results and feedback demonstrate its effectiveness, usability, and intelligence.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven serious games have been used in health care to offer a customizable and immersive experience. Summarizing the features of the current AI-driven serious games is very important to explore how they have been developed and used and their current state to plan on how to leverage them in the current and future health care needs.\nThis study aimed to explore the features of AI-driven serious games in health care as reported by previous research.\nWe conducted a scoping review to achieve the abovementioned objective. The most popular databases in the information technology and health fields (ie, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar) were searched using keywords related to serious games and AI. Two reviewers independently performed the study selection process. Three reviewers independently extracted data from the included studies. A narrative approach was used for data synthesis.\nThe search process returned 1470 records. Of these 1470 records, 46 (31.29%) met all eligibility criteria. A total of 64 different serious games were found in the included studies. Motor impairment was the most common health condition targeted by these serious games. Serious games were used for rehabilitation in most of the studies. The most common genres of serious games were role-playing games, puzzle games, and platform games. Unity was the most prominent game engine used to develop serious games. PCs were the most common platform used to play serious games. The most common algorithm used in the included studies was support vector machine. The most common purposes of AI were the detection of disease and the evaluation of user performance. The size of the data set ranged from 36 to 795,600. The most common validation techniques used in the included studies were k-fold cross-validation and training-test split validation. Accuracy was the most commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of AI models.\nThe last decade witnessed an increase in the development of AI-driven serious games for health care purposes, targeting various health conditions, and leveraging multiple AI algorithms; this rising trend is expected to continue for years to come. Although the evidence uncovered in this study shows promising applications of AI-driven serious games, larger and more rigorous, diverse, and robust studies may be needed to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of AI-driven serious games in different populations with different health conditions.", "To conduct a simulation study to determine whether artificial intelligence (AI)-aided mammography reading can reduce unnecessary recalls while maintaining cancer detection ability in women recalled after mammography screening.\nA retrospective reader study was performed by screening mammographies of 793 women (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 50 \u00b1 9 years) recalled to obtain supplemental mammographic views regarding screening mammography-detected abnormalities between January 2016 and December 2019 at two screening centers. Initial screening mammography examinations were interpreted by three dedicated breast radiologists sequentially, case by case, with and without AI aid, in a single session. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and recall rate for breast cancer diagnosis were obtained and compared between the two reading modes.\nFifty-four mammograms with cancer (35 invasive cancers and 19 ductal carcinomas in situ) and 739 mammograms with benign or negative findings were included. The reader-averaged AUC improved after AI aid, from 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-0.85) to 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.94) (p < 0.001). The reader-averaged specificities before and after AI aid were 41.9% (95% CI, 39.3%-44.5%) and 53.9% (95% CI, 50.9%-56.9%), respectively (p < 0.001). The reader-averaged sensitivity was not statistically different between AI-unaided and AI-aided readings: 89.5% (95% CI, 83.1%-95.9%) vs. 92.6% (95% CI, 86.2%-99.0%) (p = 0.053), although the sensitivities of the least experienced radiologists before and after AI aid were 79.6% (43 of 54 [95% CI, 66.5%-89.4%]) and 90.7% (49 of 54 [95% CI, 79.7%-96.9%]), respectively (p = 0.031). With AI aid, the reader-averaged recall rate decreased by from 60.4% (95% CI, 57.8%-62.9%) to 49.5% (95% CI, 46.5%-52.4%) (p < 0.001).\nAI-aided reading reduced the number of recalls and improved the diagnostic performance in our simulation using women initially recalled for supplemental mammographic views after mammography screening.", "Glioblastoma is the most aggressive type of primary adult brain tumour. The median survival of patients with glioblastoma remains approximately 15 months, and the 5-year survival rate is <10%. Current treatment options are limited, and the standard of care has remained relatively constant since 2011. Over the last decade, a range of different treatment regimens have been investigated with very limited success. Tumour recurrence is almost inevitable with the current treatment strategies, as glioblastoma tumours are highly heterogeneous and invasive. Additionally, another challenging issue facing patients with glioblastoma is how to distinguish between tumour progression and treatment effects, especially when relying on routine diagnostic imaging techniques in the clinic. The specificity of routine imaging for identifying tumour progression early or in a timely manner is poor due to the appearance similarity of post-treatment effects. Here, we concisely describe the current status and challenges in the assessment and early prediction of therapy response and the early detection of tumour progression or recurrence. We also summarize and discuss studies of advanced approaches such as quantitative imaging, liquid biomarker discovery and machine intelligence that hold exceptional potential to aid in the therapy monitoring of this malignancy and early prediction of therapy response, which may decisively transform the conventional detection methods in the era of precision medicine.", "Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have diverse applications in medicine. As AI tools advance towards clinical implementation, skills in how to use and interpret AI in a healthcare setting could become integral for physicians. This study examines undergraduate medical students' perceptions of AI, educational opportunities about of AI in medicine, and the desired medium for AI curriculum delivery.\nA 32 question survey for undergraduate medical students was distributed from May-October 2021 to students to all 17 Canadian medical schools. The survey assessed the currently available learning opportunities about AI, the perceived need for learning opportunities about AI, and barriers to educating about AI in medicine. Interviews were conducted with participants to provide narrative context to survey responses. Likert scale survey questions were scored from 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree). Interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis.\nWe received 486 responses from 17 of 17 medical schools (roughly 5% of Canadian undergraduate medical students). The mean age of respondents was 25.34, with 45% being in their first year of medical school, 27% in their 2nd year, 15% in their 3rd year, and 10% in their 4th year. Respondents agreed that AI applications in medicine would become common in the future (94% agree) and would improve medicine (84% agree Further, respondents agreed that they would need to use and understand AI during their medical careers (73% agree; 68% agree), and that AI should be formally taught in medical education (67% agree). In contrast, a significant number of participants indicated that they did not have any formal educational opportunities about AI (85% disagree) and that AI-related learning opportunities were inadequate (74% disagree). Interviews with 18 students were conducted. Emerging themes from the interviews were a lack of formal education opportunities and non-AI content taking priority in the curriculum.\nA lack of educational opportunities about AI in medicine were identified across Canada in the participating students. As AI tools are currently progressing towards clinical implementation and there is currently a lack of educational opportunities about AI in medicine, AI should be considered for inclusion in formal medical curriculum.", "The pandemic produced by SARS-CoV-2 impacted on educative systems, which justifies the necessity of research about the emotional capacities of the university students to face the challenges that COVID-19 imposes.\nTo analyze the evidences of validity and reliability of the Wong-Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS) in Cuban dental students.\nCross-sectional study with instrumental design.

The aim of this study was to compare the prediction of cardiovascular events by automated cardiovascular magnetic resonance with those of other simple measures of aortic stiffness suitable for population screening. Methods and Results Aortic distensibility was measured from automated segmentation of aortic cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance using artificial intelligence in 8435 participants. The associations of distensibility, brachial pulse pressure, and stiffness index (obtained by finger photoplethysmography) with conventional risk factors was examined by multivariable regression and incident cardiovascular events by Cox proportional-hazards regression. Mean (\u00b1SD) distensibility values for men and women were 1.77\u00b11.15 and 2.10\u00b11.45 (P<0.0001) 10-3 mm\u2009Hg-1, respectively. There was a good correlation between automatically and manually obtained systolic and diastolic aortic areas (r=0.980 and r=0.985, respectively). In regression analysis, distensibility associated with age, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, weight, and plasma glucose but not male sex, cholesterol or current smoking. During an average follow-up of 2.8\u00b11.3\u2009years, 86 participants experienced cardiovascular events 6 of whom died. Higher distensibility was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.61 per log unit of distensibility; P=0.016). There was no evidence of an association between pulse pressure (adjusted HR 1.00; P=0.715) or stiffness index (adjusted HR, 1.02; P=0.535) and risk of cardiovascular events. Conclusions Automated cardiovascular magnetic resonance-derived aortic distensibility may be incorporated into routine clinical imaging. It shows a similar association to cardiovascular risk factors as other measures of arterial stiffness and predicts new-onset cardiovascular events, making it a useful tool for the measurement of vascular aging and associated cardiovascular risk.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) will have a significant impact on healthcare over the coming decade. At the same time, health inequity remains one of the biggest challenges. Primary care is both a driver and a mitigator of health inequities and with AI gaining traction in primary care, there is a need for a holistic understanding of how AI affect health inequities, through the act of providing care and through potential system effects. This paper presents a systematic scoping review of the ways AI implementation in primary care may impact health inequity.\nFollowing a systematic scoping review approach, we searched for literature related to AI, health inequity, and implementation challenges of AI in primary care. In addition, articles from primary exploratory searches were added, and through reference screening.The results were thematically summarised and used to produce both a narrative and conceptual model for the mechanisms by which social determinants of health and AI in primary care could interact to either improve or worsen health inequities.Two public advisors were involved in the review process.\nPeer-reviewed publications and grey literature in English and Scandinavian languages.\nPubMed, SCOPUS and JSTOR.\nA total of 1529 publications were identified, of which 86 met the inclusion criteria. The findings were summarised under six different domains, covering both positive and negative effects: (1) access, (2) trust, (3) dehumanisation, (4) agency for self-care, (5) algorithmic bias and (6) external effects. The five first domains cover aspects of the interface between the patient and the primary care system, while the last domain covers care system-wide and societal effects of AI in primary care. A graphical model has been produced to illustrate this. Community involvement throughout the whole process of designing and implementing of AI in primary care was a common suggestion to mitigate the potential negative effects of AI.\nAI has the potential to affect health inequities through a multitude of ways, both directly in the patient consultation and through transformative system effects. This review summarises these effects from a system tive and provides a base for future research into responsible implementation.", "Digital imaging, including the use of artificial intelligence, has been increasingly applied to investigate the placenta and its related pathology. However, there has been no comprehensive review of this body of work to date. The aim of this study was to therefore review the literature regarding digital pathology of the placenta. A systematic literature search was conducted in several electronic databases. Studies involving the application of digital imaging and artificial intelligence techniques to human placental samples were retrieved and analyzed. Relevant articles were categorized by digital image technique and their relevance to studying normal and diseased placenta. Of 2008 retrieved articles, 279 were included. Digital imaging research related to the placenta was often coupled with immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, 3D reconstruction, and/or deep learning algorithms. By significantly increasing pathologists' ability to recognize potentially prognostic relevant features and by lessening inter-observer variability, published data overall indicate that the application of digital pathology to placental and perinatal diseases, along with clinical and radiology correlation, has great potential to improve fetal and maternal health care including the selection of targeted therapy in high-risk pregnancy.", "With the development of more advanced methods for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, the data required for medical care are becoming complex, and misinterpretation of information due to human error may result in serious consequences. Human error can be avoided with the support of artificial intelligence (AI). AI models trained with various medical data for diagnosis and management of liver diseases have been applied to hepatitis, fatty liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Some of these models have been reported to outperform human experts in terms of performance, indicating their potential for supporting clinical practice given their high-speed output. This paper summarizes the recent advances in AI for liver disease and introduces the AI-aided diagnosis of liver tumors using B-mode ultrasonography.", "Background: Bipolar disorder is considered a psychiatric disease without any effective screening questionnaire to monitor and manage Iranian patients. This study aims to implement a researcher-made questionnaire in the form of educational interactive software for better management of patients with bipolar disorder and prevent further complications. Methods: The present cross-sectional study evaluated the efficacy of psychoeducational-interactive-therapeutic software for patients with bipolar disorder, which is a network-based software providing a researcher-made questionnaire in a planned manner. This software can predict the occurrence of future bipolar episodes for each patient by using artificial intelligence algorithms after the occurrence of two mood episodes as the training phase. The patients with bipolar disorder were asked to use the software for a year and their mood episodes were compared before and after using the software. We evaluate the reliability of the questionnaires in the software with internal consistency using alpha Cronbach test and test-retest analysis. Face validity and content validity were also evaluated. Results: The content validity index of the instrument was 93%, and the Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the whole questionnaire was 0.955. Also, the ICC coefficient for this questionnaire is above 0.70, and the correlation coefficient of the answers in all constructs of the questionnaire is more than 0.8. Thirty male patients with bipolar disorder who experienced four episodes of mood swings per year experienced an average of 2 mood episodes per year following the use of this software. Conclusion: Our Psychoeducational-interactive-therapeutic software is the first Persian language software based on artificial intelligence to monitor clinical symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder, which uses a standard questionnaire to predict the incidence of episodes of depression and mania in these patients.", "Lupus nephropathy (LN) occurs in approximately 50% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 20% of them will eventually progress into end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A clinical tool predicting remission of proteinuria might be of utmost importance. In our work, we focused on predicting the chance of complete remission achievement in LN patients, using artificial intelligence models, especially an artificial neural network, called the multi-layer perceptron.\nIt was a single centre retrospective study, including 58 individuals, with diagnosed systemic lupus erythematous and biopsy proven lupus nephritis. Patients were assigned into the study cohort, between 1st January 2010 and 31st December 2020, and eventually randomly allocated either to the training set (N\u2009=\u200946) or testing set (N\u2009=\u200912). The end point was remission achievement. We have selected an array of variables, subsequently reduced to the optimal minimum set, providing the best performance.\nWe have obtained satisfactory results creating predictive models allowing to assess, with accuracy of 91.67%, a chance of achieving a complete remission, with a high discriminant ability (AUROC 0.9375).\nOur solution allows an accurate assessment of complete remission achievement and monitoring of patients from the group with a lower probability of complete remission. The obtained models are scalable and can be improved by introducing new patient records.", "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has arrived for the health care sector and is finally penetrating the far-reaching but perpetually underfinanced primary care platform. While AI has the potential to facilitate the achievement of the Quintuple Aim (better patient outcomes, population health, and health equity at lower costs while preserving clinician well-being), inattention to primary care training in the use of AI-based tools risks the opposite effects, imposing harm and exacerbating inequalities. The impact of AI-based tools on these aims will depend heavily on the decisions and skills of primary care clinicians; therefore, appropriate medical education and training will be crucial to maximize potential benefits and minimize harms. To facilitate this training, we propose 6 domains of competency for the effective deployment of AI-based tools in primary care: (1) foundational knowledge (what is this tool?), (2) critical appraisal (should I use this tool?), (3) medical decision making (when should I use this tool?), (4) technical use (how do I use this tool?), (5) patient communication (how should I communicate with patients regarding the use of this tool?), and (6) awareness of unintended consequences (what are the \"side effects\" of this tool?). Integrating these competencies will not be straightforward because of the breadth of knowledge already incorporated into family medicine training and the constantly changing technological landscape. Nonetheless, even incremental increases in AI-relevant training may be beneficial, and the sooner these challenges are tackled, the sooner the primary care workforce and those served by it will begin to reap the benefits.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is the level to which an individual is aware of, understands, and manages their emotional state. It also includes the level to which an individual is able to appreciate the emotional status of others. In 1995, Daniel Goleman's book, Emotional Intelligence, popularized the many theories and studies about EI. Since then, EI has transformed into a learned, applicable concept that can improve personal relationships and patients' experiences and lead to an increase in profitability for the aesthetic practitioner. The purpose of this article is to help the reader understand what EI is and how it can be applied in our everyday lives both personally and professionally. I also describe what I have learned about EI during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. I highlight the four components of EI that are the most crucial. These are self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.", "This study investigated the mathematical problem-solving ability of 42,644 ninth-grade students who participated in regional education quality health monitoring from Z province in East China and the factors which influence their performance of mathematical problem-solving. The results are as follows: (1) ~96% of the students' mathematics problem-solving ability meets the basic academic requirements of the mathematics curriculum standards; (2) boys and children without siblings performed better, and urban students performed significantly better than county and rural students; (3) ~28% of students' mathematical problem-solving performance came from inter-school variability; urban and rural backgrounds had a greater impact on mathematical problem-solving than did teaching factors, while teaching self-efficacy had the least impact among the school-level influencing factors. In contrast, the influence of individual non-intelligence factors was higher than that of student background variables, including a greater positive effect of self-efficacy and a greater negative effect of mathematics anxiety.", "Interest in critical care-related artificial intelligence (AI) research is growing rapidly. However, the literature is still lacking in comprehensive bibliometric studies that measure and analyze scientific publications globally.\nThe objective of this study was to assess the global research trends in AI in intensive care medicine based on publication outputs, citations, coauthorships between nations, and co-occurrences of author keywords.\nA total of 3619 documents published until March 2022 were retrieved from the Scopus database. After selecting the document type as articles, the titles and abstracts were checked for eligibility. In the final bibliometric study using VOSviewer, 1198 papers were included. The growth rate of publications, preferred journals, leading research countries, international collaborations, and top institutions were computed.\nThe number of publications increased steeply between 2018 and 2022, accounting for 72.53% (869/1198) of all the included papers. The United States and China contributed to approximately 55.17% (661/1198) of the total publications. Of the 15 most productive institutions, 9 were among the top 100 universities worldwide. Detecting clinical deterioration, monitoring, predicting disease progression, mortality, prognosis, and classifying disease phenotypes or subtypes were some of the research hot spots for AI in patients who are critically ill. Neural networks, decision support systems, machine learning, and deep learning were all commonly used AI technologies.\nThis study highlights popular areas in AI research aimed at improving health care in intensive care units, offers a comprehensive look at the research trend in AI application in the intensive care unit, and provides an insight into potential collaboration and prospects for future research. The 30 articles that received the most citations were listed in detail. For AI-based clinical research to be sufficiently convincing for routine critical care practice, collaborative research efforts are needed to increase the maturity and robustness of AI-driven models.", "Research on self-reported knowledge and overclaiming in children is sparse. With the current study, we aim to close this gap by developing an overclaiming questionnaire measuring self-reported knowledge and overclaiming that is tailored to children. Moreover, we examine the nomological net of self-reported knowledge and overclaiming in childhood discussing three perspectives: Overclaiming as (a) a result of deliberate self-enhancement tendencies, (b) a proxy for declarative knowledge, and (c) an indicator of creative engagement. We juxtaposed overclaiming, as indicated by claiming familiarity with non-existent terms, and self-reported knowledge with fluid and crystallized intelligence, creativity, and personality traits in a sample of 897 children attending third grade. The results of several latent variable analyses were similar to findings known from adult samples: We found no strong evidence for any of the competing perspectives on overclaiming. Just like in adults, individual differences in self-reported knowledge were strongly inflated by overclaiming, and only weakly related to declarative knowledge.", "This study used quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) to investigate the characteristics of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subtypes in children.\nThere were 69 subjects (42 with ADHD and 27 neurotypical (NT)) in this study. A semi-structured interview was conducted with each participant for psychiatric diagnostic evaluation. We measured the absolute and relative power in 19 channels and analyzed QEEG using the following frequency ranges: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10 Hz), alpha 2 (10-12 Hz), beta 1 (12-15 Hz), beta 2 (15-20 Hz), beta 3 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz). Group analyses and EEG noise preprocessing were conducted using iSyncBrain, a cloud-based, artificial intelligence EEG analysis platform. Analysis of covariance adjusted for IQ, age, and sex was used.\nQEEG analysis revealed three ADHD subtypes, characterized by (A) elevated relative fast alpha and beta power, (B) elevated absolute slow frequency (delta and theta power), or (C) elevated absolute and relative beta power. A significant difference was found in the Korean ADHD Rating Scale (K-ARS) among the four groups (df=3, F=8.004, p<0.001); group C had the highest score (25.31\u00b111.16), followed by group A (21.67\u00b113.18). The score of group B (12.64\u00b17.84) was similar to that of the NT group (11.07\u00b16.12) and did not reach the cut-off point of the K-ARS. In the Wender-Utah Rating Scale (WURS), group B score (55.82\u00b123.17) was significantly higher than the NT group score (42.81\u00b113.26).\nThese results indicate that children with ADHD do not constitute a neurophysiologically homogenous group. Children with QEEG subtype B (elevated slow frequency) may be difficult to distinguish from normal children using the K-ARS, which is the most common screening tool for ADHD. Moreover, parents of children with this subtype may be less sensitive to observing ADHD symptoms.", "Neurocognitive deficits are central in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation has proven effective in alleviating these deficits, with medium effect sizes. However, sizeable attrition rates are reported, with the reasons still uncertain. Furthermore, cognitive remediation is not part of routine mental health care. We conducted a systematic review to investigate factors that influence access and engagement of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia.\nWe systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for peer-reviewed articles including a cognitive remediation arm, access, and engagement data, and participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders aged 17-65 years old. Duplicates and studies without a distinct cognitive remediation component, protocol papers, single case studies, case series, and reviews/meta-analyses were excluded.\nWe included 67 studies that reported data on access and engagement, and extracted quantitative and qualitative data. Access data were limited, with most interventions delivered on-site, to outpatients, and in middle- to high-income countries. We found a median dropout rate of 14.29%. Only a small number of studies explored differences between dropouts and completers (n\u2009=\u20095), and engagement factors (n\u2009=\u200913). Dropouts had higher negative symptomatology and baseline self-efficacy, and lower baseline neurocognitive functioning and intrinsic motivation compared to completers. The engagement was positively associated with intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, educational level, premorbid intelligence quotient, baseline neurocognitive functioning, some neurocognitive outcomes, and therapeutic alliance; and negatively associated with subjective cognitive complaints. Qualitative results showed good acceptability of cognitive remediation, with some areas for improvement.\nOverall, access and engagement results are scarce and heterogeneous. Further investigations of cognitive remediation for inpatients, as well as remote delivery, are needed. Future clinical trials should systematically explore attrition and related factors. Determining influential factors of access and engagement will help improve the implementation and efficacy of cognitive remediation, and thus the recovery of people with schizophrenia.\nLes d\u00e9ficits neurocognitifs sont au centre de la schizophr\u00e9nie.

We increased our understanding of risk factors and mechanisms of atrial arrhythmias, the prediction of atrial arrhythmias, response to treatment, and outcomes using machine learning and artificial intelligence. There have been new technologies and techniques for atrial fibrillation ablation, including pulsed field ablation. There have been new randomized trials in atrial fibrillation ablation, giving insight about rhythm control, and long-term outcomes. There have been advances in our understanding of treatment of inherited disorders such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. We have gained new insights into the recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of various conditions such as myocarditis and inherited cardiomyopathic disorders. Novel computational approaches may help predict occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias and localize arrhythmias to guide ablation. There are further advances in our understanding of noninvasive radiotherapy. We have increased our understanding of the role of His bundle pacing and left bundle branch area pacing to maintain synchronous ventricular activation. There have also been significant advances in the defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy, remote monitoring, and infection prevention. There have been advances in our understanding of the pathways and mechanisms involved in atrial and ventricular arrhythmogenesis.", "As the global burden of antibiotic resistance continues to grow, creative approaches to antibiotic discovery are needed to accelerate the development of novel medicines. A rapidly progressing computational revolution-artificial intelligence-offers an optimistic path forward due to its ability to alleviate bottlenecks in the antibiotic discovery pipeline. In this review, we discuss how advancements in artificial intelligence are reinvigorating the adoption of past antibiotic discovery models-namely natural product exploration and small molecule screening. We then explore the application of contemporary machine learning approaches to emerging areas of antibiotic discovery, including antibacterial systems biology, drug combination development, antimicrobial peptide discovery, and mechanism of action prediction. Lastly, we propose a call to action for open access of high-quality screening datasets and interdisciplinary collaboration to accelerate the rate at which machine learning models can be trained and new antibiotic drugs can be developed.", "This paper aims to provide an overview of the possibility regarding the artificial intelligence application in orthopaedics to predict dislocation with a calculator according to the type of implant (hemiarthroplasty, standard total hip arthroplasty, dual mobility, constrained cups) after primary arthroplasty.\nAmong 75 results for primary arthroplasties, 26 articles were reviews on dislocation after hemiarthroplasty, 40 after standard total hip arthroplasty, seven about primary dual-mobility arthroplasty (DM THA), and two reviews about constrained implants. Although our search method for systematic reviews covers ten years (2012-2022), none for dual mobility was published before 2016, showing a recent explosion of original articles on this subject. A total of 1,069,565 implants and 26,488 dislocations in primary arthroplasties are included in these 75 reviews. We used a supervised learning model in which models assign objects to groups as input and artificial neural network (ANN) with nodes, hidden layers, and output layers. We considered only four implant types as the input layer. We considered the patient's factors (indication for THA, demographics, spine surgery, and neurologic disease) as the second input values (hidden layer). We considered the implant position as the third input (hidden layer) property including head size, combined anteversion, or spinopelvic alignment. Surgery-related factors, approach, capsule repair, etc. were the fourth input values (hidden layer). The output was a post-operative dislocation or not within three months.\nThe accuracy for predicting dislocation with this systematic review was 95%. Dislocation risk, based on the type of implant, was wide-ranging, from 0 to 3.9% (mean 0.31%) for the 3045 DM THA, from 0.2 to 1.2% (overall 0.91%) for the 457 constrained liners, from 1.76 to 4.2% (mean 2.1%) for 895,734 conventional total hip arthroplasties, and from 0.76 to 12.2% (mean 4.5%) for 170,329 hemiarthroplasties. In the conventional THA group, many factors increase the risk of dislocation according to the calculator, and only a few (big head, anterior approach) decrease the risk, but not very significantly. In the hemiarthroplasty group, many factors can increase the risk of dislocation until 30%, but none could decrease the risk. According to the calculator, the DM THA and the constrained liner markedly decreased the risk and were not affected by implant position, spine surgery, and spinopelvic position.\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first to yield an implant-specific dislocation risk calculator that incorporates the patient's comorbidities, the position of components, and surgery factors affecting instability risk.", "Conductive hydrogels (CHs) have attracted considerable attentions in the fields of wearable electronics, disease diagnosis, and artificial intelligence. However, it is still a great challenge to prepare a single CH system with integrated characteristics of high stretchability, good transparency, and multisensory function through a simple fabrication process. Herein, carboxylic cellulose nanofibers (CCNF) were used to assist the homogeneous distribution of opaque conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) into the crosslinked polyacrylamide network for the fabrication of stretchable and transparent interpenetrating network CH, aiming for a high-performance multisensory system. As expected, the ready formation of hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and a great deal of hydrophilic groups in the hydrogel endow the obtained CH with excellent humidity response behavior in a wide range (0-85%), and the introduction of CCNF and PEDOT: PSS is proved to be an effective strategy to enhance the humidity sensitivity, exhibiting great potential for the noncontact sensing of human respiration and finger movement. Meanwhile, it also displays excellent strain sensing behavior with favorable sensitivity in a broad range (0-837\u00a0%), fast response and reliable stability and reproducibility. Importantly, our prepared CH can also detect and discriminate complicated human activities and physiological signals. All these demonstrate the superiority of our prepared CH for the new generation of flexible wearable electronics.", "Breast cancer accounts for 30% of female cancers and is the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths in women. The rate is rising at 0.4% per year. Early detection is crucial to improve treatment efficacy and overall survival of women diagnosed with breast cancer. Digital Mammography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis have widely demonstrated their role as a screening tool. However, screening mammography is limited by radiologist's experience, unnecessarily high recalls, overdiagnosis, overtreatment and, in the case of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis, long reporting time. This is compounded by an increasing shortage of manpower and resources issue, especially among breast imaging specialists. Recent advances in image analysis with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in breast imaging have the potential to overcome some of these needs and address the clinical challenges in cancer detection, assessment of treatment response, and monitoring disease progression. This article focuses on the most important clinical implication and future application of AI in the field of digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis, providing the readers with a comprehensive overview of AI impact in cancer detection, diagnosis, reduction of workload and breast cancer risk stratification.", "Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entity on earth, acting as the predators and evolutionary drivers of bacteria. Owing to their inherent ability to specifically infect and kill bacteria, phages and their encoded endolysins and receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) have enormous potential for development into precision antimicrobials for treatment of bacterial infections and microbial disbalances; or as biocontrol agents to tackle bacterial contaminations during various biotechnological processes. The extraordinary binding specificity of phages and RBPs can be exploited in various areas of bacterial diagnostics and monitoring, from food production to health care. We review and describe the distinctive features of phage RBPs, explain why they are attractive candidates for use as therapeutics and in diagnostics, discuss recent applications using RBPs, and finally provide our perspective on how synthetic technology and artificial intelligence-driven approaches will revolutionize how we use these tools in the future.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is considered as a necessary qualification for Health Service executives in order to emotionally understand the human resources they manage and how to best handle people, situations and infrastructures. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the EI levels of healthcare executives (senior, middle and junior executives), in the field of health, in relation to sex. An EI Scale Assessment Questionnaire was used, which explores aspects of EI, such as estimating, expressing, regulating and using EI in problem solving. The sample consisted of 161 participants and data analysis was implemented based on criterion x 2. The data analysis showed that health care managers express a high level of emotional perception, and management- evaluation of their own and other emotions. In addition, results in relation to sex revealed that women express higher EI than men and also express higher management-evaluation of self-esteem than men.", "The automated recognition of human emotions plays an important role in developing machines with emotional intelligence. Major research efforts are dedicated to the development of emotion recognition methods. However, most of the affective computing models are based on images, audio, videos and brain signals. Literature lacks works that focus on utilizing only peripheral signals for emotion recognition (ER), which can be ideally implemented in daily life settings. Therefore, this paper present a framework for ER on the arousal and valence space, based on using multi-modal peripheral signals. The data used in this work were collected during a debate between two people using wearable devices. The emotions of the participants were rated by multiple raters and converted into classes in correspondence to the arousal and valence space. The use of a dynamic threshold for ratings conversion was investigated. An ER model is proposed that uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based architecture for classification. The model uses heart rate (HR), temperature (T), and electrodermal activity (EDA) signals as its inputs with emotional cues. Additionally, a post-processing prediction mechanism is introduced to enhance the recognition performance. The model is implemented to study the use of individual and different combinations of the peripheral signals, as well as utilizing annotations from different ratings. Additionally, it is employed for classification of valence and arousal in an independent and combined fashion, under subject dependent and independent scenarios. The experimental results have justified the efficient performance of the proposed framework, achieving classification accuracy 96% and 93% for the independent and combined classification scenarios, accordingly. The comparison of the achieved performance against the baseline methods shows the superiority of the proposed framework and the ability to recognize arousal-valance levels with high accuracy from peripheral signals, in real-life scenarios.", "Individuals with non- or minimally verbal autism (nvASD) are primarily characterized by a severe speech production deficit, with speech limited to no or only a few words by school age. Significant unclarity remains over variability in language profiles across the lifespan, the nature of the language impairment seen, and (dis-) associations between linguistic and nonverbal cognitive measures.\nTo address these questions, we recruited both a school-age and an adult group with nvASD (total N\u2009=\u200949) and investigated relations between expressive and receptive language, and between these and nonverbal intelligence quotient (NVIQ) and sense-making capacities (the ComFor test).\nResults revealed limited variation across this sample in receptive language, which in turn predicted expressive language levels. Importantly, an upward trend in verbal mental age (VMA) across increasing chronological age was seen in the youngsters (only). A radical dissociation between NVIQ and both expressive and receptive language transpired as well, and a subset of individuals with normal NVIQ were comparable in terms of any other cognitive aspect. Sense-making reached symbolic levels in 62.2% of the sample and loaded on both verbal and nonverbal factors.\nThese patterns inform theories of nvASD by revealing an impairment that is not conceptualizable as one of expressive language only, sharply limits learning opportunities across the lifespan, and cannot be compensated for by nonverbal cognition.\nThese findings stress the need to seize developmental opportunities that may disappear when youngsters turn into adults, via therapies that specifically target language as a central cognitive system comprising both production and comprehension.", "Autoimmune liver diseases (AiLDs) are rare autoimmune conditions of the liver and the biliary tree with unknown etiology and limited treatment options. AiLDs are inherently characterized by a high degree of complexity, which poses great challenges in understanding their etiopathogenesis, developing novel biomarkers and risk-stratification tools, and, eventually, generating new drugs. Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the best candidates to support researchers and clinicians in making sense of biological complexity. In this review, we offer a primer on AI and machine learning for clinicians, and discuss recent available literature on its applications in medicine and more specifically how it can help to tackle major unmet needs in AiLDs.", "Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) has been available for nearly two decades but has grappled with being an equal diagnostic alternative to optical colonoscopy (OC). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, CCE has gained more foothold in clinical practice. In this cutting-edge review, we aim to present the existing knowledge on the pros and cons of CCE and discuss whether the modality is ready for a larger roll-out in clinical settings. We have included clinical trials and reviews with the most significant impact on the current position of CCE in clinical practice and discuss the challenges that persist and how they could be addressed to make CCE a more sustainable imaging modality with an adenoma detection rate equal to OC and a low re-investigation rate by a proper preselection of suitable populations. CCE is embedded with a very low risk of severe complications and can be performed in the patient's home as a pain-free procedure. The diagnostic accuracy is found to be equal to OC. However, a significant drawback is low completion rates eliciting a high re-investigation rate. Furthermore, the bowel preparation before CCE is extensive due to the high demand for clean mucosa. CCE is currently not suitable for large-scale implementation in clinical practice mainly due to high re-investigation rates. By a better preselection before CCE and the implantation of artificial intelligence for picture and video analysis, CCE could be the alternative to OC needed to move away from in-hospital services and relieve long-waiting lists for OC.", "The extent of empathy is an individual human property, not completely dependent on cognitive intelligence. People arise with certain genetic fundament for empathy but the ability to perceive empathically develops further during the life. There has been much discussion in the medical literature about the importance of empathy and physician communication style in medical practice. Empathy has been shown to have a very real positive eff ect on patients outcomes. The literature suggests that empathy training is warranted and should be incorporated into surgical residencies through didactics, role-playing and simulations, and apprenticeship to empathic attending role models.\nThis paper reviews empathy and its importance as it pertains to the physician-patient relationship and improving patients outcomes, and the need for increased education in empathy during medical training.", "A multifaceted response, including government action, is essential to improve population levels of physical activity (PA). This article describes the development process of the 'Physical Activity Environment Policy Index' (PA-EPI) monitoring framework, a tool to assess government policies and actions for creating a healthy PA environment.\nAn iterative process was undertaken. This involved a review of policy documents from authoritative organizations, a PA policy audit of four European countries, and a systematic review of scientific literature. This was followed by an online consultation with academic experts (N\u2009=\u2009101; 20 countries, 72% response rate), and policymakers (N\u2009=\u200940, 4 EU countries). During this process, consensus workshops were conducted, where quantitative and qualitative data, alongside theoretical and pragmatic considerations, were used to inform PA-EPI development.\nThe PA-EPI is conceptualized as a two-component 'policy' and 'infrastructure support' framework. The two-components comprise eight policy and seven infrastructure support domains. The policy domains are education, transport, urban design, healthcare, public education (including mass media), sport-for-all, workplaces and community. The infrastructure support domains are leadership, governance, monitoring and intelligence, funding and resources, platforms for interaction, workforce development and health-in-all-policies. Forty-five 'good practice statements' or indicators of ideal good practice within each domain conclude the PA-EPI. A potential eight-step process for conducting the PA-EPI is described.\nOnce pre-tested and piloted in several countries of various sizes and income levels, the PA-EPI good practice statements will evolve into benchmarks established by governments at the forefront of creating and implementing policies to address inactivity.", "The upgrading of the digital economy (DE) is crucial to building an intelligent society. The rapid development of computational intelligence in recent years has also brought vitality to the development of the DE. However, with the deepening of international trade, the issue of trade security has become more and more prominent. Therefore, this study aimed to construct a DE trade security evaluation system. For computational intelligence, this study proposes a support vector machine based on improved particle swarm optimization. Such an algorithm can play a key role in the construction of an evaluation system. It is built for the evaluation system. This study selects five indicators of market competitiveness, trade control, trade dependence, market concentration, and trade legal system evaluation. The experimental results of this study prove that the evaluation system proposed in this study is effective. In its test for some countries in the world, the UK trade security index was the highest at 0.582, while China was relatively low at 0.492.", "Developmental dyslexia is a specific learning disorder that presents cognitive and neurobiological impairments related to different patterns of brain activation throughout development, continuing in adulthood. Lexical decision tasks, together with electroencephalography (EEG) measures that have great temporal precision, allow the capture of cognitive processes during the task, and can assist in the understanding of altered brain activation processes in adult dyslexics. High-density EEG allows the use of temporal analyses through event-related potentials (ERPs). The aim of this study was to compare and measure the pattern of ERPs in adults with developmental dyslexia and good readers, and to characterize and compare reading patterns between groups. Twenty university adults diagnosed with developmental dyslexia and 23 healthy adult readers paired with dyslexics participated in the study. The groups were assessed in tests of intelligence, phonological awareness, reading, and writing, as well as through the lexical decision test (LDT). During LDT, ERPs were recorded using a 128-channel EEG device. The ERPs P100 occipital, N170 occipito-temporal, N400 centro-parietal, and LPC centro-parietal were analyzed. The results showed a different cognitive profile between the groups in the reading, phonological awareness, and writing tests but not in the intelligence test. In addition, the brain activation pattern of the ERPs was different between the groups in terms of hemispheric lateralization, with higher amplitude of N170 in the dyslexia group in the right hemisphere and opposite pattern in the control group and specificities in relation to the items of the LDT, as the N400 were more negative in the Dyslexia group for words, while in the control group, this ERP was more pronounced in the pseudowords. These results are important for understanding different brain patterns in developmental dyslexia and can better guide future interventions according to the changes found in the profile.", "Since the turn of the century, Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) has come into widespread use in medical and psychological treatment settings. It is also used as self-help by tens of millions of people each year. Clinical EFT, the manualized form of the method, has been validated as an \"evidence-based\" practice using criteria published by the American Psychological Association (APA) Division 12 Task Force on Empirically Validated Therapies. Its three essential ingredients are exposure, cognitive framing, and acupressure.\nIn 2013 we published a paper defining Clinical EFT and reviewing published research. It has been viewed or downloaded over 36,000 times, indicating widespread interest in this treatment modality. Here we update our findings based on subsequently published literature and propose directions for future research.\nWe performed a systematic review of the literature to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses. Retrieval of 4,167 results resulted in the identification of 56 RCTs (n = 2,013), 41 of which were published subsequent to our earlier review, as well as eight meta-analyses.\nRCTs have found EFT treatment to be effective for (a) psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (b) physiological issues such as pain, insomnia, and autoimmune conditions; (c) professional and sports performance; and (d) biological markers of stress. Meta-analyses evaluating the effect of EFT treatment have found it to be \"moderate\" to \"large.\" Successful independent replication studies have been carried out for anxiety, depression, PTSD, phobias, sports performance, and cortisol levels. We outline the next steps in EFT research. These include determining its impact on cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive impairment; analysis of the large-scale datasets made possible by mobile apps; and delivery through channels such as virtual practitioner sessions, artificial intelligence agents, online courses, apps, virtual reality platforms, and standardized group therapy.\nSubsequent research has confirmed the conclusions of earlier studies. These find Clinical EFT to be efficacious for a range of psychological and physiological conditions. Comparatively few treatment sessions are required, treatment is effective whether delivered in person or virtually, and symptom improvements persist over time. Treatment is associated with measurable biological effects in the dimensions of gene expression, brain synchrony, hormonal synthesis, and a wide range of biomarkers. Clinical EFT is a stable and mature method with an extensive evidence base. Its use in primary care settings as a safe, rapid, reliable, and effective treatment for both psychological and medical diagnoses continues to grow.", "The awareness and utilization of psychological therapies for Alzheimer's disease have increased significantly in recent years. Limitations on the utilization of pharmacological therapy for Alzheimer's disease in China have corresponded with this surge in greater studies in the field. For individuals who have Alzheimer's disease, cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a quick self-help that is founded on the theories of quality and cognitive functioning. People with Alzheimer's disease often participate in cognitive behavioral programs; however, their expense has never been studied. Being part of a meta-analysis, we analyze the application effectiveness of a CST program that is based on recent research for Alzheimer's disease patients. A CST group therapy was given to 91 Alzheimer's patients, who resided in healthcare settings or the general public, multiple times per week for 8 weeks; the other 70 people with Alzheimer's disease got a medical therapy. Costs were computed, and resource utilization was tracked for 8 weeks both before and after the therapy. It was determined by a value study. In the value study, cognition and quality of life were the major and tertiary outcomes, respectively. Contours of cost-effectiveness and acceptance were drawn. It was driven based on expert consultation and semistructured interviews. In Alzheimer's disease, CST improves intelligence and standard of living, and there was no difference in implementation expenditures between the categories. Regarding both outcome metrics, there is a significant chance that CST seems to be more expensive than conventional therapy within realistic expectations. The efficacy of CST for Alzheimer's patients is superior to conventional treatment, and it could be the greater value. The outcomes contrast well with pharmacological studies for Alzheimer's. Many people with Alzheimer's disease may benefit significantly from CST groups.", "Background: A high level of education or intelligence (IQ) is reported to be a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the causal relationships between IQ, educational attainment (EA), cognitive performance, and PD. Methods: We used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies on IQ, EA, cognitive performance, and PD. Four genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for PD were used to comprehensively explore the causal relationship, including PD GWAS (regardless of sex), age at onset of PD GWAS, male with PD GWAS, and female with PD GWAS data. We conducted a two sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode methods to evaluate the causal association between these factors. MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO were used for sensitivity analysis to test and correct horizontal pleiotropy. Multivariate MR (MVMR) was also used to account for the covariation between IQ, EA, and cognition, as well as to explore potential mediating factors. Results: Genetically predicted higher IQ was associated with an increased risk of PD in the entire population, regardless of gender. In the analyses using the IVW method, the odds ratio was 1.37 (p = 0.0064). Men with a higher IQ, more years of education, or stronger cognitive ability are more likely to develop PD compared to women. MVMR showed that adjusting for education and cognition largely attenuated the association between IQ and PD, suggesting that education and cognition may mediate the effect of IQ on PD. Conclusion: This study provides genetic support for the causal link between higher IQ and an increased risk of PD.", "The aim of this study was to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI) system that can automatically detect and classify protruded gastric lesions and help address the challenges of diagnostic accuracy and inter-reader variability encountered in routine diagnostic workflow.\nWe analyzed data from 1,366 participants who underwent gastroscopy at Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital and Yangzhou First People's Hospital between December 2010 and December 2020. These patients were diagnosed with submucosal tumors (SMTs) including gastric stromal tumors (GISTs), gastric leiomyomas (GILs), and gastric ectopic pancreas (GEP). We trained and validated a multimodal, multipath AI system (MMP-AI) using the data set. We assessed the diagnostic performance of the proposed AI system using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared its performance with that of endoscopists with more than 5 years of experience in endoscopic diagnosis.\nIn the ternary classification task among subtypes of SMTs using modality images, MMP-AI achieved the highest AUCs of 0.896, 0.890, and 0.999 for classifying GIST, GIL, and GEP, respectively. The performance of the model was verified using both external and internal longitudinal data sets. Compared with endoscopists, MMP-AI achieved higher recognition accuracy for SMTs.\nWe developed a system called MMP-AI to identify protruding benign gastric lesions. This system can be used not only for white-light endoscope image recognition but also for endoscopic ultrasonography image analysis.", "The fog computing concept was proposed to help cloud computing for the data processing of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, fog computing faces several challenges such as security, privacy, and storage. One way to address these challenges is to integrate blockchain with fog computing. There are several applications of blockchain-fog computing integration that have been proposed, recently, due to their lucrative benefits such as enhancing security and privacy. There is a need to systematically review and synthesize the literature on this topic of blockchain-fog computing integration. The purposes of integrating blockchain and fog computing were determined using a systematic literature review approach and tailored search criteria established from the research questions. In this research, 181 relevant papers were found and reviewed. The results showed that the authors proposed the combination of blockchain and fog computing for several purposes such as security, privacy, access control, and trust management. A lack of standards and laws may make it difficult for blockchain and fog computing to be integrated in the future, particularly in light of newly developed technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence. The findings of this paper serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners of blockchain-fog computing integration for future research and designs.", "In this study, we developed a simplified artificial intelligence to support the clinical decision-making of medical personnel in a resource-limited setting.\nWe selected seven infectious disease categories that impose a heavy disease burden in the central Vietnam region: mosquito-borne disease, acute gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infection, pulmonary tuberculosis, sepsis, primary nervous system infection, and viral hepatitis. We developed a set of questionnaires to collect information on the current symptoms and history of patients suspected to have infectious diseases. We used data collected from 1,129 patients to develop and test a diagnostic model. We used XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost algorithms to create artificial intelligence for clinical decision support. We used a 4-fold cross-validation method to validate the artificial intelligence model. After 4-fold cross-validation, we tested artificial intelligence models on a separate test dataset and estimated diagnostic accuracy for each model.\nWe recruited 1,129 patients for final analyses. Artificial intelligence developed by the CatBoost algorithm showed the best performance, with 87.61% accuracy and an F1-score of 87.71. The F1-score of the CatBoost model by disease entity ranged from 0.80 to 0.97. Diagnostic accuracy was the lowest for sepsis and the highest for central nervous system infection.\nSimplified artificial intelligence could be helpful in clinical decision support in settings with limited resources.", "Growing evidence from animal and human research indicates the importance of homeostatic regulation of the circadian clock in the body. Dysfunction of the circadian clock caused by jet lag or night-shift work increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Thus, it is important to consider the circadian clock function for prevention of these diseases. Chrono-nutrition is a recently established research field that examines the relationship between the timing of food/nutrition and health. It is well known that breakfast skipping and late-night meals are independent risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Chrono-nutrition also advocates research on nutrition and the biological clock and the social implementation of the research. Breakfast can advance the phase of the peripheral clock, but late dinner can delay it. Moreover, many functional foods and nutrients, such as caffeine and polyphenols, regulate the circadian clock. In this review, we discuss how diet/nutrition entrains the peripheral clock and the relationship between meal timing and health outcomes. In addition, the effects of time-restricted feeding/eating on metabolism and related diseases are discussed. Lastly, we introduce \"personalized chrono-nutrition,\" that uses recent progress of technology such as sensors and the artificial intelligence/internet of things (AI/IOT) to promote personalized chrono-nutritional suggestions and health systems.", "A training dataset that is limited to a specific endoscope model can overfit artificial intelligence (AI) to its unique image characteristics. The performance of the AI may degrade in images of different endoscope model. The domain adaptation algorithm, i.e., the cycle-consistent adversarial network (cycleGAN), can transform the image characteristics into AI-friendly styles. We attempted to confirm the performance degradation of AIs in images of various endoscope models and aimed to improve them using cycleGAN transformation. Two AI models were developed from data of esophagogastroduodenoscopies collected retrospectively over 5 years: one for identifying the endoscope models, Olympus CV-260SL, CV-290 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and PENTAX EPK-i (PENTAX Medical, Tokyo, Japan), and the other for recognizing the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). The AIs were trained using 45,683 standardized images from 1,498 cases and validated on 624 separate cases. Between the two endoscope manufacturers, there was a difference in image characteristics that could be distinguished without error by AI. The accuracy of the AI in recognizing gastroesophageal junction was >0.979 in the same endoscope-examined validation dataset as the training dataset. However, they deteriorated in datasets from different endoscopes. Cycle-consistent adversarial network can successfully convert image characteristics to ameliorate the AI performance. The improvements were statistically significant and greater in datasets from different endoscope manufacturers [original \u2192 AI-trained style, increased area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, P-value: CV-260SL \u2192 CV-290, 0.0056, P = 0.0106; CV-260SL \u2192 EPK-i, 0.0182, P = 0.0158; CV-290 \u2192 CV-260SL, 0.0134, P < 0.0001; CV-290 \u2192 EPK-i, 0.0299, P = 0.0001; EPK-i \u2192 CV-260SL, 0.0215, P = 0.0024; and EPK-i \u2192 CV-290, 0.0616, P < 0.0001]. In conclusion, cycleGAN can transform the diverse image characteristics of endoscope models into an AI-trained style to improve the detection performance of AI.", "The industrial internet of things (IIoT), a leading technology to digitize industrial sectors and applications, requires the integration of edge and cloud computing, cyber security, and artificial intelligence to enhance its efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. However, the collection of heterogeneous data from individual sensors as well as monitoring and managing large databases with sufficient security has become a concerning issue for the IIoT framework. The development of a smart and integrated IIoT infrastructure can be a possible solution that can efficiently handle the aforementioned issues. This paper proposes an AI-integrated, secured IIoT infrastructure incorporating heterogeneous data collection and storing capability, global inter-communication, and a real-time anomaly detection model. To this end, smart data acquisition devices are designed and developed through which energy data are transferred to the edge IIoT servers. Hash encoding credentials and transport layer security protocol are applied to the servers. Furthermore, these servers can exchange data through a secured message queuing telemetry transport protocol. Edge and cloud databases are exploited to handle big data. For detecting the anomalies of individual electrical appliances in real-time, an algorithm based on a group of isolation forest models is developed and implemented on edge and cloud servers as well. In addition, remote-accessible online dashboards are implemented, enabling users to monitor the system. Overall, this study covers hardware design; the development of open-source IIoT servers and databases; the implementation of an interconnected global networking system; the deployment of edge and cloud artificial intelligence; and the development of real-time monitoring dashboards. Necessary performance results are measured, and they demonstrate elaborately investigating the feasibility of the proposed IIoT framework at the end.", "Optical synapse is the basic component for optical neuromorphic computing and is attracting great attention, mainly due to its great potential in many fields, such as image recognition, artificial intelligence and artificial visual perception systems. However, optical synapse with infrared (IR) response has rarely been reported. InAs nanowires (NWs) have a direct narrow bandgap and a large surface to volume ratio, making them a promising material for IR detection. Here, we demonstrate a near-infrared (NIR) (750 to 1550 nm) optical synapse for the first time based on a poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE))-coated InAs NW field-effect transistor (FET). The responsivity of the P(VDF-TrFE)-coated InAs NW FET reaches 839.3 A/W under 750 nm laser illumination, demonstrating the advantage of P(VDF-TrFE) coverage. The P(VDF-TrFE)-coated InAs NW device exhibits optical synaptic behaviors in response to NIR light pulses, including excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and a transformation from short-term plasticity (STP) to long-term plasticity (LTP). The working mechanism is attributed to the polarization effect in the ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) layer, which dominates the trapping and de-trapping characteristics of photogenerated holes. These findings have significant implications for the development of artificial neural networks.", "Accurate disease characterization is the pillar of modern treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and endoscopy is the mainstay of disease assessment and colorectal cancer surveillance. Recent technological progress has enhanced and expanded the use of endoscopy in IBD. In particular, numerous artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems have shown to support human endoscopists' evaluations, improving accuracy and consistency while saving time. Moreover, advanced optical technologies such as endocytoscopy (EC), allowing high magnification in vivo, can bridge endoscopy with histology. Furthermore, molecular imaging, through probe based confocal laser endomicroscopy allows the real-time detection of specific biomarkers on gastrointestinal surface, and could be used to predict therapeutic response, paving the way to precision medicine. In parallel, as the applications of AI spread, computers are positioned to resolve some of the limitations of human histopathology evaluation, such as interobserver variability and inconsistencies in assessment. The aim of this review is to summarize the most promising advances in endoscopic and histologic assessment of IBD.", "This study aimed to investigate how medical students perceive their educational environment, as well as the implications of motivation, learning strategies, and the factor of emotional intelligence on academic achievement.\nIn a cross-sectional study, 3384 undergraduate students were recruited from randomly selected Egyptian medical colleges. Students from second to final year, taking fundamental and clinical courses and, at a minimum, three professional exams, were enrolled and subjected to the Dundee Ready Educational Environment Measure scale, the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire, and Emotional intelligence questionnaire.\nThe overall mean age of the studied students was 21.42 \u00b1 1.61 years. Females represented 63.5%, rural residents were 52.2% and students with enough income represented 88.0%. The traditional system adopted 28.4% of the students versus 71.6% in the integrated system. Linear regression using path analysis was conducted to study the predictors of academic achievement, and it revealed that motivation was the highly significant predictor of academic achievement (\u03b2 = 2.68, CI95%:2.35-3.05, P < 0.001), followed by learning (\u03b2 = 1.09, CI95%:0.80-1.41, P < 0.001), emotional intelligence (\u03b2 = 0.92, CI95%:0.87-0.97, P < 0.001), and the educational environment (\u03b2 = 0.14, CI95%:0.13-0.15, P < 0.001).\nThe study's findings have implications for medical educators trying to understand the personal factors that influence learning and performance in medical school. Students' motivation was the highly significant predictor of academic achievement followed by learning, emotional intelligence, and educational environment. Perception of the learning environment had improved because of the integrated student-centered system, which fosters motivation and emotional intelligence. To improve learners' EI, optimal learning, and educational outcomes, the EI components can be taught and fostered.", "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), also known as drones have been used for a variety of reasons and the commercial drone market growth is expected to reach remarkable levels in the near future. However, some drone users can mistakenly or intentionally fly into flight paths at major airports, flying too close to commercial aircraft or invading people's privacy. In order to prevent these unwanted events, counter-drone technology is needed to eliminate threats from drones and hopefully they can be integrated into the skies safely. There are various counter-drone methods available in the industry. However, a counter-drone system supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) method can be an efficient way to fight against drones instead of human intervention. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method has been proposed to counter a drone in a 3D space by using another drone. In a 2D space it is already shown that the deep reinforcement learning method is an effective way to counter a drone. However, countering a drone in a 3D space with another drone is a very challenging task considering the time required to train and avoid obstacles at the same time. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm with dueling network architecture and prioritized experience replay is presented to catch another drone in the environment provided by an Airsim simulator. The models have been trained and tested with different scenarios to analyze the learning progress of the drone. Experiences from previous training are also transferred before starting a new training by pre-processing the previous experiences and eliminating those considered as bad experiences. The results show that the best models are obtained with transfer learning and the drone learning progress has been increased dramatically. Additionally, an algorithm which combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning is implemented to catch the target drone. In this algorithm, called deep q-learning from demonstrations (DQfD), expert demonstrations data and self-generated data by the agent are sampled and the agent continues learning without overwriting the demonstration data. The main advantage of this algorithm is to accelerate the learning process even if there is a small amount of demonstration data.", "The safety of road construction is one of the most important concerns of construction managers for the following reasons: long-span construction operation, no fixed monitoring cameras, and huge impacts on existing traffic, while the managers still rely on manual inspection and a lack of image records. With the fast development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), monitoring safety concerns of road construction sites becomes easily accessible. This research aims to integrate UAVs and AI to establish a UAV-based road construction safety monitoring platform. In this study, road construction safety factors including constructors, construction vehicles, safety signs, and guardrails are defined and monitored to make up for the lack of image data at the road construction site. The main findings of this study include three aspects. First, the flight and photography schemes are proposed based on the UAV platform for information collection for road construction. Second, deep learning algorithms including YOLOv4 and DeepSORT are utilized to automatically detect and track safety factors. Third, a road construction dataset is established with 3594 images. The results show that the UAV-based monitoring platform can help managers with security inspection and recording images.", "Multiple cancer types have limited targeted therapeutic options, in part due to incomplete understanding of the molecular processes underlying tumorigenesis and significant intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity. Identification of novel molecular biomarkers stratifying cancer patients with different survival outcomes may provide new opportunities for target discovery and subsequent development of tailored therapies. Here, we applied the artificial intelligence-driven PandaOmics platform ( https://pandaomics.com/ ) to explore gene expression changes in rare DNA repair-deficient disorders and identify novel cancer targets. Our analysis revealed that CEP135, a scaffolding protein associated with early centriole biogenesis, is commonly downregulated in DNA repair diseases with high cancer predisposition. Further screening of survival data in 33 cancers available at TCGA database identified sarcoma as a cancer type where lower survival was significantly associated with high CEP135 expression. Stratification of cancer patients based on CEP135 expression enabled us to examine therapeutic targets that could be used for the improvement of existing therapies against sarcoma. The latter was based on application of the PandaOmics target-ID algorithm coupled with in vitro studies that revealed polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) as a potential therapeutic candidate in sarcoma patients with high CEP135 levels and poor survival. While further target validation is required, this study demonstrated the potential of in silico-based studies for a rapid biomarker discovery and target characterization.", "Today, many maritime nations have been promoting boat sports proactively, including sailing races. As sailing races are large-scale regattas that require massive workforces to monitor the game fairly; however, with limited match budgets and labors, Internet of Things (IoT) technology supports monitoring games has become a trend. This article proposes a robot umpire system in sailing races based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, using drones and AIoT technology to monitor sailing matches. When a large number of sailboats are in a match, and each sail along different routes, drones can monitor the entire game simultaneously. The features of this proposed approach are (1) The system recognizes images by Faster R-CNN, judging whether a sailboat uses a motor to accelerate; (2) The system detects conditions by edge computing; when cheating behaviors happen, it can notify the event holder immediately; (3) Advanced drone route plans can avoid collision incidents; (4) Improve the system recognition by federated learning. This study has implemented an experiment with real drones and installed IoT equipment on the drones for taking videos and recognizing. The experimental result has shown that the proposed approach is feasible and benefits the match's fairness. Additionally, umpires can review the violation details from the videos taken by the drones, supporting evidence for judging.", "Gold standard behavioral weight loss (BWL) is limited by the availability of expert clinicians and high cost of delivery. The artificial intelligence (AI) technique of reinforcement learning (RL) is an optimization solution that tracks outcomes associated with specific actions and, over time, learns which actions yield a desired outcome. RL is increasingly utilized to optimize medical treatments (e.g., chemotherapy dosages), and has very recently started to be utilized by behavioral treatments. For example, we previously demonstrated that RL successfully optimized BWL by dynamically choosing between treatments of varying cost/intensity each week for each participant based on automatic monitoring of digital data (e.g., weight change). In that preliminary work, participants randomized to the AI condition required one-third the amount of coaching contact as those randomized to the gold standard condition but had nearly identical weight losses. The current protocol extends our pilot work and will be the first full-scale randomized controlled trial of a RL system for weight control. The primary aim is to evaluate the hypothesis that a RL-based 12-month BWL program will produce non-inferior weight losses to standard BWL treatment, but at lower costs. Secondary aims include testing mechanistic targets (calorie intake, physical activity) and predictors (depression, binge eating). As such, adults with overweight/obesity (N\u00a0=\u00a0336) will be randomized to either a gold standard condition (12\u00a0months of weekly BWL groups) or AI-optimized weekly interventions that represent a combination of expert-led group, expert-led call, paraprofessional-led call, and automated message). Participants will be assessed at 0, 1, 6 and 12\u00a0months.", "Advanced intelligent vehicle control systems have evolved in the last few decades thanks to the use of artificial-intelligence-based techniques, the appearance of new sensors, and the development of technology necessary for their implementation [...].", "Comparing a family structure to a company, one can often think of parents as leaders and adolescents as employees. Stressful family environments and anxiety levels, depression levels, personality disorders, emotional regulation difficulties, and childhood trauma may all contribute to non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behaviors. We presented a support vector machine (SVM) based method for discovering the key factors among mazy candidates that affected NSSI in adolescents. Using SVM as the base learner, and the binary dragonfly algorithm was used to find the feature combination that minimized the objective function, which took into account both the prediction error and the number of selected variables. Unlike univariate model analysis, we used a multivariate model to explore the risk factors, which better revealed the interactions between factors. Our research showed that adolescent education level, anxiety and depression level, borderline and avoidant personality traits, as well as emotional abuse and physical neglect in childhood, were associated with mood disorders in adolescents. Furthermore, gender, adolescent education level, physical abuse in childhood, non-acceptance of emotional responses, as well as paranoid, borderline, and histrionic personality traits, were associated with an increased risk of NSSI. These findings can help us make better use of artificial intelligence technology to extract potential factors leading to NSSI in adolescents from massive data, and provide theoretical support for the prevention and intervention of NSSI in adolescents.", "Nature may have the answer to many of our questions about human, animal, and environmental health. Natural bioactives, especially when harvested from sustainable plant and food sources, provide a plethora of molecular solutions to nutritionally actionable, chronic conditions. The spectrum of these conditions, such as metabolic, immune, and gastrointestinal disorders, has changed with prolonged human life span, which should be matched with an appropriately extended health span, which would in turn favour more sustainable health care: \"adding years to life and adding life to years\". To date, bioactive peptides have been undervalued and underexploited as food ingredients and drugs. The future of translational science on bioactive peptides-and natural bioactives in general-is being built on (a) systems-level rather than reductionist strategies for understanding their interdependent, and at times synergistic, functions; and (b) the leverage of artificial intelligence for prediction and discovery, thereby significantly reducing the time from idea and concept to finished solutions for consumers and patients. This new strategy follows the path from benefit definition via design to prediction and, eventually, validation and production.", "Aims: This study investigated the feasibility and accuracy of real-time three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic transilluminated imaging (TrueVue Glass) in left atrial appendage (LAA) anatomical morphology and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 3D automated LAA measurement (3D Auto LAA) software in the preoperative evaluation of LAA occlusion (LAAO) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Method and results: Thirty-seven patients with AF were selected. Two-dimensional (2D) and real-time 3D transesophageal echocardiography (RT3D-TEE) were performed preoperatively, using conventional 3D, the new 3D TrueVue Glass mode, and cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to assess and type the morphology of LAA. Physiological parameters were measured using traditional 2D and 3D manual (3D Manual LAA), 3D Auto LAA, and CCTA. TrueVue Glass for LAA outer contour display was compared with CCTA. Comparisons were based on correlation and consistency in measuring the maximum diameter (LZ max), minimum diameter (LZ min), area (LZ area), and circumference (LZ cir) of LAA landing zone (LZ). Times and variabilities were compared. The concordance rate for external shape of LAA was 97.14% between TrueVue Glass and CCTA. 3D Auto LAA and 3D Manual LAA have a stronger correlation and higher consistency in all parameters. 3D Auto LAA showed higher intra- and interobserver reproducibility and allowed quicker analysis (p < 0.05). LAAO was performed in 35 patients (94.59%), and none of which had serious adverse events. Conclusion: TrueVue Glass is the first non-invasive and radiation-free visualization of the overall external contour of LAA and its adjacent structures. 3D Auto LAA simplifies the measurement, making the preoperative assessment more efficient and convenient while ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility. A combination of the two is feasible for accurate and rapid assessment of LAA anatomy and physiology in AF patients and has practical application in LAAO.", "To critically appraise the literature on the application, methods, and advances in emergency electroencephalography (EEG).\nThe development of rapid EEG (rEEG) technologies and other reduced montage approaches, along with advances in machine learning over the past decade, has increased the rate and access to EEG acquisition. These achievements have made EEG in the emergency setting a practical diagnostic technique for detecting seizures, suspected nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), altered mental status, stroke, and in the setting of sedation. Growing evidence supports using EEG to expedite medical decision-making in the setting of suspected acute neurological injury. This review covers approaches to acquiring EEG in the emergency setting in the adult and pediatric populations. We also cover the clinical impact of this data, the time associated with emergency EEG, and the costs of acquiring EEG in these settings. Finally, we discuss the advances in artificial intelligence for rapid electrophysiological interpretation.", "In the recent era, nursing needs employees with moral intelligence, cultural competence, and self-compassion skills more than ever. This study aimed to determine the predictors of moral intelligence and its relationship with self-compassion and cultural competence in nursing students.\nThis cross-sectional and multi-center descriptive study was conducted in 2022. With convenience sampling, 250 nursing students from three Iranian universities participated in this study. Data gathering included the Moral Intelligence Questionnaire, Self-Compassion Scale (short form), and Cultural Competency Questionnaire. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, the correlation between variables, and hierarchical regression.\nThe results showed that nursing students had good moral intelligence (72.63\u2009\u00b1\u200911.38), moderate self-compassion (37.19\u2009\u00b1\u20095.02), and poor cultural competence (50.06\u2009\u00b1\u200913.15). No statistically significant relationship was observed between self-compassion and cultural competence (r\u00a0=\u20090.11, p\u2009=\u20090.07). Moral intelligence with marital status (r\u2009=\u20090.16, p\u2009=\u20090.01), academic year (r\u00a0=\u20090.14, p\u2009=\u20090.03) and self-compassion (r\u00a0=\u20090.33, p\u00a0<\u20090.001) had a significant relationship in such a way that these variables explained 15% of moral intelligence and self-compassion had the highest impact (p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nConsidering the moderate level of self-compassion and the poor level of cultural competence reported in the undergraduate nursing students, and also that self-compassion was known to be a predictive factor for moral intelligence, planners and educators must pay more attention to promoting self-compassion and cultural competency in the curriculum and conduct studies to find ways to improve them.", "Sulfide in natural waters is highly toxic to aquatic organisms. The occurrence of sulfide in natural waters is closely related to water quality and the biogeochemical processes of many other elements because of the labile chemical properties of sulfide. Therefore, it is very important to obtain real and timely concentrations of sulfide in natural waters. In fact, the determination of sulfide in natural waters has long been a hot issue in the field of environmental monitoring. Researchers have developed various analytical methods, mainly based on spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, chemiluminescence, electrochemistry, chromatography, and flow-based techniques. In addition, substantial progress has been made in the aspect of automation and intelligence. This review systematically summarized the state-of-the-art progress on the determination of sulfide in natural waters, including sample collection and pretreatment, laboratory analysis, on-site analysis, and in-situ monitoring. The advantages and disadvantages and application scope of each method were compared. The trend of future development was also proposed.", "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) derived ventricular volumes and function guide clinical decision-making for various cardiac pathologies. We aimed to evaluate the efficiency and clinical applicability of a commercially available artificial intelligence (AI) method for performing biventricular volumetric analysis. Three-hundred CMR studies (100 with normal CMR findings, 50 dilated cardiomyopathy, 50 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 50 ischaemic heart disease and 50 congenital or valvular heart disease) were randomly selected from database. Manual biventricular volumetric analysis (CMRtools) results were derived from clinical reports and automated volumetric analyses were performed using short axis volumetry AI function of CircleCVI42 v5.12 software. For 20 studies, a combined method of manually adjusted AI contours was tested and all three methods were timed. Clinicians` confidence in AI method was assessed using an online survey. Although agreement was better for left ventricle than right ventricle, AI analysis results were comparable to manual method. Manual adjustment of AI contours further improved agreement: within subject coefficient of variation decreased from 5.0% to 4.5% for left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and from 9.9% to 7.1% for right ventricular EF. Twenty manual analyses were performed in 250\u00a0min 12\u00a0s whereas same task took 5\u00a0min 48\u00a0s using AI method. Clinicians were open to adopt AI but concerns about accuracy and validity were raised. The AI method provides clinically valid outcomes and saves significant time. To address concerns raised by survey participants and overcome shortcomings of the automated myocardial segmentation, visual assessment of contours and performing manual corrections where necessary appears to be a practical approach.", "The inhibitory effects of Euryale ferox seed shell extract (EFSSE) on the activity of \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase were studied. EFSSE (0.25\u00a0% to 2\u00a0%) was used to fortify bread and analyzed the in vitro starch digestibility (IVSD) digestion kinetics, and the predicted glycemic index (pGI) was estimated. The swarm intelligence supervised neural network (SISNN) technique was applied for the predictive simulation of digestion kinetics and pGI. Principal component analysis (PCA) with proportional odds modeling (POM) was used to find the most sensitive component based on the sensory attributes of bread. The inhibitory effect of EFSSE on \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase in terms of IC50 was 62.95 and 52.06\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. Fortification of bread with EFSSE could affect loaf volume, hardness, and color. Euryale ferox seed shell extract could decreased the rate of hydrolysis of bread. EFSSE (2\u00a0%) had a strong inhibitory impact, as evidenced by the drop in glycemic index from 94.61 to 61.66. SISNN-based kinetics was much better as compared to mathematical modeling-based digestion kinetics. Findings of the present study have shown that EFSSE could be employed as an additive to produce lower glycemic index functional bread.", "Heart rate at rest and exercise may predict cardiovascular risk. Heart rate variability is a measure of variation in time between each heartbeat, representing the balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system and may predict adverse cardiovascular events. With advances in technology and increasing commercial interest, the scope of remote monitoring health systems has expanded. In this review, we discuss the concepts behind cardiac signal generation and recording, wearable devices, pros and cons focusing on accuracy, ease of application of commercial and medical grade diagnostic devices, which showed promising results in terms of reliability and value. Incorporation of artificial intelligence and cloud based remote monitoring have been evolving to facilitate timely data processing, improve patient convenience and ensure data security.", "Forest fire prevention is very important for the protection of the ecological environment, which requires effective prevention and timely suppression. The opening of the firebreaks barrier contributes significantly to forest fire prevention. The development of an artificial intelligence algorithm makes it possible for an intelligent belt opener to create the opening of the firebreak barrier. This paper introduces an innovative vision system of an intelligent belt opener to monitor the environment during the creation of the opening of the firebreak barrier. It can provide precise geometric and location information on trees through the combination of LIDAR data and deep learning methods. Four deep learning networks including PointRCNN, PointPillars, SECOND, and PV-RCNN were investigated in this paper, and we train each of the four networks using our stand tree detection dataset which is built on the KITTI point cloud dataset. Among them, the PointRCNN showed the highest detection accuracy followed by PV-RCNN and PV-RCNN. SECOND showed less detection accuracy but can detect the most targets.", "The likelihood of timely treatment for cervical cancer increases with timely detection of abnormal cervical cells. Automated methods of detecting abnormal cervical cells were established because manual identification requires skilled pathologists and is time consuming and prone to error. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for the prediction, screening, and diagnosis of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions.\nComprehensive searches were performed on three databases: Medline, Web of Science Core Collection (Indexes = SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A & HCI Timespan) and Scopus to find papers published until July 2022. Articles that applied any AI technique for the prediction, screening, and diagnosis of cervical cancer were included in the review. No time restriction was applied. Articles were searched, screened, incorporated, and analyzed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines.\nThe primary search yielded 2538 articles. After screening and evaluation of eligibility, 117 studies were incorporated in the review. AI techniques were found to play a significant role in screening systems for pre-cancerous and cancerous cervical lesions. The accuracy of the algorithms in predicting cervical cancer varied from 70% to 100%. AI techniques make a distinction between cancerous and normal Pap smears with 80-100% accuracy. AI is expected to serve as a practical tool for doctors in making accurate clinical diagnoses. The reported sensitivity and specificity of AI in colposcopy for the detection of CIN2+ were 71.9-98.22% and 51.8-96.2%, respectively.\nThe present review highlights the acceptable performance of AI systems in the prediction, screening, or detection of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions, especially when faced with a paucity of specialized centers or medical resources. In combination with human evaluation, AI could serve as a helpful tool in the interpretation of cervical smears or images.", "Water transparency affects the degree of sunlight penetration in water, which is important to many water quality processes. It can be visually measured by lowering a Secchi disk (SD) into water and recording its disappearance depth - the Secchi disk depth (SDD). High frequency SDD measurement is manpower intensive, precluding better understanding of the daily and diurnal variation of water transparency. For the first time, an artificial intelligence based object detection algorithm was employed for the automatic detection of SD from images, mimicking SDD measurement by human eyes. The trained model was validated on a large number of images (about 2000 for a single day in daytime) obtained from a remote-controlled imaging system in a fish farm in a Hong Kong embayment, demonstrating high detection accuracy of 93\u00a0%. The work opens up opportunities in the nowcast and forecast of short-term water quality changes (e.g. algal blooms) in coastal waters.", "This paper merges new research topics in Industry 5.0 using the Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) approach able to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) in production processes. The goal is to provide an innovative approach to model production management in industry, adopting a new \"proof of concept\" of advanced Process Mining (PM) automatizing decisions and optimizing machine setting and maintenance interventions. Advanced electronic sensing and actuation systems, integrating supervised and unsupervised AI algorithms, are embedded in the PM model as theoretical process workflows suggested by a Decision Support System (DSS) engine enabling an intelligent decision-making procedure. The paper discusses, as examples, two theoretical models applied to specific industry sectors, such as food processing and energy production. The proposed work provides important elements of engineering management related to the digitalization of production process matching with automated control systems setting production parameters, thus enabling the self-adapting of product quality supervision and production efficiency in modern industrial systems.", "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the world. The arrhythmia and methods developed to cure it have been studied for several decades. However, professionals worldwide are still working to improve treatment quality. One novel technology that can be useful is a wearable device. The two most used recordings from these devices are photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. As the price lowers, these devices will become significant technology to increase sensitivity, for monitoring and for treatment quality support. This is important as AF can be challenging to detect in advance, especially during home monitoring. Modern artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to respond to this challenge. AI has already achieved state of the art results in many applications, including bioengineering. In this perspective, we discuss wearable devices combined with AI for AF detection, an approach that enables a new era of possibilities for the future.", "Information and Communication Technology (ICT) makes cities \"smart\", capable of providing advanced municipal services to citizens more efficiently. In the literature, many applications of municipal service platform based on cloud computing and edge computing have been proposed, but the reference model and application instance based on cloud-edge collaboration specially for municipal service platform is rarely studied. In this context, this paper first develops a reference model, including resource collaboration, application collaboration, service collaboration, and security collaboration, and discusses the main contents and challenges of each part. Then, aiming at the problem of computing and communication resources allocation in the cloud-edge collaboration, a game-theory-based dynamic resource allocation model is introduced. Finally, an e-government self-service system based on the cloud-edge collaboration is designed and implemented. The cloud side is a cloud computing server, and the edge side are the self-service terminals integrating various edge computing devices with Artificial Intelligence (AI) embedded. The experimental results show that the designed system combines the advantages of cloud computing and edge computing, and provides a better user experience with lower processing latency, larger bandwidth, and more concurrent tasks. Meanwhile, the findings show that the evolutionary equilibrium and the Nash equilibrium are the optimal solutions, respectively.", "Vast amounts of rapidly accumulating biological data related to cancer and a remarkable progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) have paved the way for precision oncology. Our recent contribution to this area of research is CancerOmicsNet, an AI-based system to predict the therapeutic effects of multitargeted kinase inhibitors across various cancers. This approach was previously demonstrated to outperform other deep learning methods, graph kernel models, molecular docking, and drug binding pocket matching.\nCancerOmicsNet integrates multiple heterogeneous data by utilizing a deep graph learning model with sophisticated attention propagation mechanisms to extract highly predictive features from cancer-specific networks. The AI-based system was devised to provide more accurate and robust predictions than data-driven therapeutic discovery using gene signature reversion.\nSelected CancerOmicsNet predictions obtained for \"unseen\" data are positively validated against the biomedical literature and by live-cell time course inhibition assays performed against breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer cell lines. Encouragingly, six molecules exhibited dose-dependent antiproliferative activities, with pan-CDK inhibitor JNJ-7706621 and Src inhibitor PP1 being the most potent against the pancreatic cancer cell line Panc 04.03.\nCancerOmicsNet is a promising AI-based platform to help guide the development of new approaches in precision oncology involving a variety of tumor types and therapeutics.", "Big data has the capacity to transform both pediatric healthcare delivery and research, but its potential has yet to be fully realized. Curation of large multi-institutional datasets of high-quality data has allowed for significant advances in the timeliness of quality improvement efforts. Improved access to large datasets and computational power have also paved the way for the development of high-performing, data-driven decision support tools and precision medicine approaches. However, implementation of these approaches and tools into pediatric practice has been hindered by challenges in our ability to adequately capture the heterogeneity of the pediatric population as well as the nuanced complexities of pediatric diseases such as sepsis. Moreover, there are large gaps in knowledge and definitive evidence demonstrating the utility, usability, and effectiveness of these types of tools in pediatric practice, which presents significant challenges to provider willingness to leverage these solutions. The next wave of transformation for pediatric healthcare delivery and research through big data and sophisticated analytics will require focusing efforts on strategies to overcome cultural barriers to adoption and acceptance. IMPACT: Big data from EHRs can be used to drive improvement in pediatric clinical care. Clinical decision support, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and precision medicine can transform pediatric care using big data from the EHR. This article provides a review of barriers and enablers for the effective use of data analytics in pediatric clinical care using pediatric sepsis as a use case. The impact of this review is that it will inform influencers of pediatric care about the importance of current trends in data analytics and its use in improving outcomes of care through EHR-based strategies.", "This manuscript explores the applications of deterministic artificial intelligence (DAI) in a space environment in response to unknown sensor noise and sudden changes in craft physical parameters. The current state of the art literature has proposed the method, but only ideal environments, and accordingly this article addresses the literature gaps by critically evaluating efficacy in the face of unaddressed parametric uncertainties. We compare an idealized combined non-linear feedforward (FFD) and linearized feedback (FB) control scheme with an altered feedforward, feedback, and deterministic artificial intelligence scheme in the presence of simulated craft damage and environmental disturbances. Mean trajectory tracking error was improved over 91%, while the standard deviation was improved over 97% whilst improving (reducing) control effort by 13%.", "Foods contain not only nutrients but also a wide variety of components related to flavor and functionality. Many studies have been conducted on the components of foods. Quantitative analysis has been used to assess compounds in food such as sugars, amino acids, and organic acids for food flavor; carotenoids and anthocyanins for appearance and color; and vitamins related to functionality for human health. Plants and animals that are food materials are thought to contain hundreds to thousands of compounds. Recent improvements in analytical technologies have made it possible to detect a large number of compounds simultaneously using metabolomics, a comprehensive analysis technology for low-molecular-weight compounds, and its application to food analysis has been reported. Food metabolomics has the potential to identify compounds related to flavor and functionality that have not been reported in previous studies; moreover, it is expected to add value to the target foods. By integrating the results of sensory evaluation, animal experiments, and other experiments with metabolomic data and providing them for analysis using informatics, such as artificial intelligence, it may be possible to derive more accurate evaluations of food quality.", "Blood cells carry important information that can be used to represent a person's current state of health. The identification of different types of blood cells in a timely and precise manner is essential to cutting the infection risks that people face on a daily basis. The BCNet is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based deep learning (DL) framework that was proposed based on the capability of transfer learning with a convolutional neural network to rapidly and automatically identify the blood cells in an eight-class identification scenario: Basophil, Eosinophil, Erythroblast, Immature Granulocytes, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Neutrophil, and Platelet. For the purpose of establishing the dependability and viability of BCNet, exhaustive experiments consisting of five-fold cross-validation tests are carried out. Using the transfer learning strategy, we conducted in-depth comprehensive experiments on the proposed BCNet's architecture and test it with three optimizers of ADAM, RMSprop (RMSP), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Meanwhile, the performance of the proposed BCNet is directly compared using the same dataset with the state-of-the-art deep learning models of DensNet, ResNet, Inception, and MobileNet. When employing the different optimizers, the BCNet framework demonstrated better classification performance with ADAM and RMSP optimizers. The best evaluation performance was achieved using the RMSP optimizer in terms of 98.51% accuracy and 96.24% F1-score. Compared with the baseline model, the BCNet clearly improved the prediction accuracy performance 1.94%, 3.33%, and 1.65% using the optimizers of ADAM, RMSP, and SGD, respectively. The proposed BCNet model outperformed the AI models of DenseNet, ResNet, Inception, and MobileNet in terms of the testing time of a single blood cell image by 10.98, 4.26, 2.03, and 0.21 msec. In comparison to the most recent deep learning models, the BCNet model could be able to generate encouraging outcomes. It is essential for the advancement of healthcare facilities to have such a recognition rate improving the detection performance of the blood cells.", "The majority of proteins are subjected to post-translational modifications (PTMs), regardless of whether they occur in or after biosynthesis of the protein. Capable of altering the physical and chemical properties and functions of proteins, PTMs are thus crucial. By fostering the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells with which they communicate in the tumor microenvironment (TME), M2 macrophages have emerged as key cellular players in the TME. Furthermore, growing evidence illustrates that PTMs can occur in M2 macrophages as well, possibly participating in molding the multifaceted characteristics and physiological behaviors in the TME. Hence, there is a need to review the PTMs that have been reported to occur within M2 macrophages. Although there are several reviews available regarding the roles of M2 macrophages, the majority of these reviews overlooked PTMs occurring within M2 macrophages. Considering this, in this review, we provide a review focusing on the advancement of PTMs that have been reported to take place within M2 macrophages, mainly in the TME, to better understand the performance of M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Incidentally, we also briefly cover the advances in developing inhibitors that target PTMs and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the prediction and analysis of PTMs at the end of the review.", "This study examined whether Heritage Language Learners (HLLs) of English display profile effects in their performance on knowledge- and processing-dependent measures relative to the standardised mean scores of monolingual speakers. The study also investigated the influence of several experiential factors on HLL performance.\nParticipants were 59 Arabic-speaking HLLs from six to nine years old. The children completed a battery of linguistic tests in their L1 and L2, as well as cognitive measures of short-term and working memory and non-verbal intelligence.\nSignificantly lower standardised scores were observed for HLLs as compared to the standardised mean scores on all Arabic/English language tasks except L2 word reading. HLLs scored at or above age-level expectations on cognitive measures except the Arabic nonword repetition task. Stepwise regression analyses examining variance in HLLs' performance, age and richness of environment consistently explained HLLs' performance in L1 Arabic, but different factors accounted for HLLs' performance in English depending on the task. Age was the only variable that consistently explained variance in performance on the cognitive measures.\nThe results suggest that processing-dependent measures may be less sensitive to difference in language experience than traditional knowledge-based measures such as standardised measures of language and vocabulary.", "Rigorous evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems for image classification is essential before deployment into health-care settings, such as screening programmes, so that adoption is effective and safe. A key step in the evaluation process is the external validation of diagnostic performance using a test set of images. We conducted a rapid literature review on methods to develop test sets, published from 2012 to 2020, in English. Using thematic analysis, we mapped themes and coded the principles using the Population, Intervention, and Comparator or Reference standard, Outcome, and Study design framework. A group of screening and AI experts assessed the evidence-based principles for completeness and provided further considerations. From the final 15 principles recommended here, five affect population, one intervention, two comparator, one reference standard, and one both reference standard and comparator. Finally, four are appliable to outcome and one to study design. Principles from the literature were useful to address biases from AI; however, they did not account for screening specific biases, which we now incorporate. The principles set out here should be used to support the development and use of test sets for studies that assess the accuracy of AI within screening programmes, to ensure they are fit for purpose and minimise bias.", "(1) Introduction: The ubiquity of mobile phones suggests the potential of mobile health applications to reach patients with type 2 diabetes and engage them to improve self-care. This study aimed to explore personal goals, barriers to self-management and desired mobile health application features to improve self-care among multi-ethnic Asian patients with type 2 diabetes. (2) Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 29). Patients were recruited from a multi-disciplinary center for diabetes and metabolism in Singapore, using a purposive sampling strategy. Various visual materials, collated from existing mobile health application features, were used to facilitate the discussion. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed. (3) Results: A total of 29 patients participated in 11 focus group discussions or one-on-one interviews. Personal goals for self-management were centered around short-term outcome expectancy, such as better glucose control and a reduced number of medications. Self-management was hampered by competing priorities and limited healthy food options when at work, while a lack of tailored advice from healthcare providers further diminished competence. The desired mobile health app features to improve self-care behaviors included quantifiable goal-setting, personalized nudges based on tracked data, built-in resources from credible sources, in-app social support through virtual interaction with peers and healthcare providers, technology-driven novel data logging and user-defined nudges. (4) Conclusions: We identified a set of app features that may foster motivation to engage in lifestyle modification for patients with T2DM. The findings serve to inform the design of artificial intelligence-enabled mobile health application intervention aimed at improving diabetes self-care.", "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming increasingly important, providing pervasive real-time applications that have been used to enhance smart environments in various fields such as smart cities, manufacturing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This survey reviews and analyzes the research trends related to the utilized Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods for WSN and the potential enhancement of WSNs using these methods. We highlight the routing challenge in WSN and present a comprehensive discussion on the recent studies that utilized various AI methods in addressing the routing challenge to meet specific objectives of WSN, during the span of 2010 to 2020. This would guide the reader towards an understanding of up-to-date applications of AI methods with respect to routing challenge in WSN. In addition, a general evaluation is provided along with a comparison of utilized AI methods in WSNs, which guides the reader in identifying the most appropriate AI methods that can be utilized for solving the routing challenge. Finally, we conclude the paper by stating the open research issues and new directions for future research.", "The possible benefits of using semantic language models in the early diagnosis of major ischemic stroke (MIS) based on artificial intelligence (AI) are still underestimated. The present study strives to assay the feasibility of the word2vec word embedding-based model in decreasing the risk of false negatives during the triage of patients with suspected MIS in the emergency department (ED).\nThe main ICD-9 codes related to MIS were used for the 7-year retrospective data collection of patients managed at the ED with a suspected diagnosis of stroke. The data underwent \"tokenization\" and \"lemmatization\". The word2vec word-embedding algorithm was used for text data vectorization.\nOut of 648 MIS, the word2vec algorithm successfully identified 83.9% of them, with an area under the curve of 93.1%.\nNatural language processing (NLP)-based models in triage have the potential to improve the early detection of MIS and to actively support the clinical staff.", "The rapid development in manufacturing industries due to the introduction of IIoT devices has led to the emergence of Industry 4.0 which results in an industry with intelligence, increased efficiency and reduction in the cost of manufacturing. However, the introduction of IIoT devices opens up the door for a variety of cyber threats in smart industries. The detection of cyber threats against such extensive, complex, and heterogeneous smart manufacturing industries is very challenging due to the lack of sufficient attack traces. Therefore, in this work, a Federated Learning enabled Deep Intrusion Detection framework is proposed to detect cyber threats in smart manufacturing industries. The proposed FLDID framework allows multiple smart manufacturing industries to build a collaborative model to detect threats and overcome the limited attack example problem with individual industries. Moreover, to ensure the privacy of model gradients, Paillier-based encryption is used in communication between edge devices (representative of smart industries) and the server. The deep learning-based hybrid model, which consists of a Convolutional Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory, and Multi-Layer Perceptron is used in the intrusion detection model. An exhaustive set of experiments on the publically available dataset proves the effectiveness of the proposed framework for detecting cyber threats in smart industries over the state-of-the-art approaches.", "Currently, one of the most common causes of death worldwide is cancer. The development of innovative methods to support the early and accurate detection of cancers is required to increase the recovery rate of patients. Several studies have shown that medical Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) combined with artificial intelligence algorithms is a powerful tool for cancer detection. Various preprocessing methods are commonly applied to hyperspectral data to improve the performance of the algorithms. However, there is currently no standard for these methods, and no studies have compared them so far in the medical field. In this work, we evaluated different combinations of preprocessing steps, including spatial and spectral smoothing, Min-Max scaling, Standard Normal Variate normalization, and a median spatial smoothing technique, with the goal of improving tumor detection in three different HSI databases concerning colorectal, esophagogastric, and brain cancers. Two machine learning and deep learning models were used to perform the pixel-wise classification. The results showed that the choice of preprocessing method affects the performance of tumor identification. The method that showed slightly better results with respect to identifing colorectal tumors was Median Filter preprocessing (0.94 of area under the curve). On the other hand, esophagogastric and brain tumors were more accurately identified using Min-Max scaling preprocessing (0.93 and 0.92 of area under the curve, respectively). However, it is observed that the Median Filter method smooths sharp spectral features, resulting in high variability in the classification performance. Therefore, based on these results, obtained with different databases acquired by different HSI instrumentation, the most relevant preprocessing technique identified in this work is Min-Max scaling.", "Because of the development of image processing using cameras and the subsequent development of artificial intelligence technology, various fields have begun to develop. However, it is difficult to implement an image processing algorithm that requires a lot of calculations on a light board. This paper proposes a method using real-time deep learning object recognition algorithms in lightweight embedded boards. We have developed an algorithm suitable for lightweight embedded boards by appropriately using two deep neural network architectures. The first architecture requires small computational volumes, although it provides low accuracy. The second architecture uses large computational volumes and provides high accuracy. The area is determined using the first architecture, which processes semantic segmentation with relatively little computation. After masking the area using the more accurate deep learning architecture, object detection is implemented with improved accuracy, as the image is filtered by segmentation and the cases that have not been recognized by various variables, such as differentiation from the background, are excluded. OpenCV (Open source Computer Vision) is used to process input images in Python, and images are processed using an efficient neural network (ENet) and You Only Look Once (YOLO). By running this algorithm, the average error can be reduced by approximately 2.4 times, allowing for more accurate object detection. In addition, object recognition can be performed in real time for lightweight embedded boards, as a rate of about 4 FPS (frames per second) is achieved.", "When describing the behaviour and modelling of real systems, which are characterized by considerable complexity, great difficulty, and often the impossibility of their formal mathematical description, and whose operational monitoring and measurement are difficult, conventional analytical-statistical models run into the limits of their use. The application of these models leads to necessary simplifications, which cause insufficient adequacy of the resulting mathematical description. In such cases, it is appropriate for modelling to use the methods brought by a new scientific discipline-artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence provides very promising tools for describing and controlling complex systems. The method of neural networks was chosen for the analysis of the lifetime of the teeming ladle. Artificial neural networks are mathematical models that approximate non-linear functions of an arbitrary waveform. The advantage of neural networks is their ability to generalize the dependencies between individual quantities by learning the presented patterns. This property of a neural network is referred to as generalization. Their use is suitable for processing complex problems where the dependencies between individual quantities are not exactly known.", "Artificial intelligence-based protein structure prediction approaches have had a transformative effect on biomolecular sciences. The predicted protein models in the AlphaFold protein structure database, however, all lack coordinates for small molecules, essential for molecular structure or function: hemoglobin lacks bound heme; zinc-finger motifs lack zinc ions essential for structural integrity and metalloproteases lack metal ions needed for catalysis. Ligands important for biological function are absent too; no ADP or ATP is bound to any of the ATPases or kinases. Here we present AlphaFill, an algorithm that uses sequence and structure similarity to 'transplant' such 'missing' small molecules and ions from experimentally determined structures to predicted protein models. The algorithm was successfully validated against experimental structures. A total of 12,029,789 transplants were performed on 995,411 AlphaFold models and are available together with associated validation metrics in the alphafill.eu databank, a resource to help scientists make new hypotheses and design targeted experiments.", "Thanks to the rapid development of computer-based systems and deep-learning-based algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) has long been integrated into the healthcare field. AI is also particularly helpful in image recognition, surgical assistance and basic research. Due to the unique nature of dermatology, AI-aided dermatological diagnosis based on image recognition has become a modern focus and future trend. Key scientific concepts of review: The use of 3D imaging systems allows clinicians to screen and label skin pigmented lesions and distributed disorders, which can provide an objective assessment and image documentation of lesion sites. Dermatoscopes combined with intelligent software help the dermatologist to easily correlate each close-up image with the corresponding marked lesion in the 3D body map. In addition, AI in the field of prosthetics can assist in the rehabilitation of patients and help to restore limb function after amputation in patients with skin tumors.\nFor the benefit of patients, dermatologists have an obligation to explore the opportunities, risks and limitations of AI applications. This study focuses on the application of emerging AI in dermatology to aid clinical diagnosis and treatment, analyzes the current state of the field and summarizes its future trends and prospects so as to help dermatologists realize the impact of new technological innovations on traditional practices so that they can embrace and use AI-based medical approaches more quickly.", "The interest of researchers, clinicians and radiologists, in artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, in which the computer algorithm itself can determine the optimal imaging features to answer a clinical question. Convolutional neural networks are the most common architecture for performing deep learning on medical images. The various musculoskeletal applications of deep learning are the detection of abnormalities on X-rays or cross-sectional images (CT, MRI), for example the detection of fractures, meniscal tears, anterior cruciate ligament tears, degenerative lesions of the spine, bone metastases, classification of e.g., dural sac stenosis, degeneration of intervertebral discs, assessment of skeletal age, and segmentation, for example of cartilage. Software developments are already impacting the daily practice of orthopedic imaging by automatically detecting fractures on radiographs. Improving image acquisition protocols, improving the quality of low-dose CT images, reducing acquisition times in MRI, or improving MR image resolution is possible through deep learning. Deep learning offers an automated way to offload time-consuming manual processes and improve practitioner performance. This article reviews the current state of AI in musculoskeletal imaging.", "Periodical vision-based inspection is a principal form of structural health monitoring (SHM) technique. Over the last decades, vision-based artificial intelligence (AI) has successfully facilitated an effortless inspection system owing to its exceptional ability of accuracy of defects' pattern recognition. However, most deep learning (DL)-based methods detect one specific type of defect, whereas DL has a high proficiency in multiple object detection. This study developed a dataset of two types of defects, i.e., concrete crack and spalling, and applied various pre-built convolutional neural network (CNN) models, i.e., VGG-19, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, Xception, and MobileNetV2 to classify these concrete defects. The dataset developed for this study has one of the largest collections of original images of concrete crack and spalling and avoided the augmentation process to replicate a more real-world condition, which makes the dataset one of a kind. Moreover, a detailed sensitivity analysis of hyper-parameters (i.e., optimizers, learning rate) was conducted to compare the classification models' performance and identify the optimal image classification condition for the best-performed CNN model. After analyzing all the models, InceptionV3 outperformed all the other models with an accuracy of 91%, precision of 83%, and recall of 100%. The InceptionV3 model performed best with optimizer stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and a learning rate of 0.001.", "Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) based on IoT sensors has been widely used, which has increased the risk of attacks targeting AI. Adversarial examples are among the most serious types of attacks in which the attacker designs inputs that can cause the machine learning system to generate incorrect outputs. Considering the architecture using multiple sensor devices, hacking even a few sensors can create a significant risk; an attacker can attack the machine learning model through the hacked sensors. Some studies demonstrated the possibility of adversarial examples on the deep neural network (DNN) model based on IoT sensors, but it was assumed that an attacker must access all features. The impact of hacking only a few sensors has not been discussed thus far. Therefore, in this study, we discuss the possibility of attacks on DNN models by hacking only a small number of sensors. In this scenario, the attacker first hacks few sensors in the system, obtains the values of the hacked sensors, and changes them to manipulate the system, but the attacker cannot obtain and change the values of the other sensors. We perform experiments using the human activity recognition model with three sensor devices attached to the chest, wrist, and ankle of a user, and demonstrate that attacks are possible by hacking a small number of sensors.", "With the availability of extensive health data, artificial intelligence has an inordinate capability to expedite medical explorations and revamp healthcare.Artificial intelligence is set to reform the practice of medicine soon. Despite the mammoth advantages of artificial intelligence in the medical field, there exists inconsistency in the ethical and legal framework for the application of AI in healthcare. Although research has been conducted by various medical disciplines investigating the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in the healthcare setting, the literature lacks a holistic approach.\nThe purpose of this review is to ascertain the ethical concerns of AI applications in healthcare, to identify the knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for an ethical and legal framework.\nElectronic databases Pub Med and Google Scholar were extensively searched based on the search strategy pertaining to the purpose of this review. Further screening of the included articles was done on the grounds of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nThe search yielded a total of 1238 articles, out of which 16 articles were identified to be eligible for this review. The selection was strictly based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned in the manuscript.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is an exceedingly puissant technology, with the prospect of advancing medical practice in the years to come. Nevertheless, AI brings with it a colossally abundant number of ethical and legal problems associated with its application in healthcare. There are manifold stakeholders in the legal and ethical issues revolving around AI and medicine. Thus, a multifaceted approach involving policymakers, developers, healthcare providers and patients is crucial to arrive at a feasible solution for mitigating the legal and ethical problems pertaining to AI in healthcare.", "Tactile sensors with visible light feedback functions, such as wearable displays and electronic skin and biomedical devices, are becoming increasingly important in various fields. However, existing methods cannot meet the application requirements for the tactile perception of intensity feedback and extended intersection due to their limited light-mapping performance and insufficient portability. Herein, a freely constructible self-powered visual tactile sensor is proposed, which consists of a high-output triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a visual light source. The transferred charge of the TENG is enhanced to 746 nC by the structural design of the triboelectric material and device, which can easily drive the light source to generate a light signal with a brightness of 9.8 cd m-2 . Notably, the application of the TENG enables to realization visual sensing of the palm-grasp state and strength feedback without an external power supply. This visual feedback and power-free tactile sensors are expected to have potential application in the field of artificial intelligence as a new interactive medium for smart protective clothing and robotics.", "Globally, foreign citizens, particularly ethnic and racial minorities, experienced discrimination and received imbalanced medical services and insufficient economic resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine the factors that affect the cultural competence of nursing students. This is descriptive cross-sectional study adheres to Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. A convenience sample of 235 nursing students from two nursing colleges in D city completed an online Google Forms questionnaire from 9 August to 12 August 2022. The self-report questionnaire included a sociodemographic data form, a cultural intelligence scale, an ethnocentrism scale, a global competence scale, and a cultural competence scale. The mean score of cultural competence was 95.39 \u00b1 15.64 (out of 135 points); cultural competence was significantly positively correlated with cultural intelligence and global competence (p < 0.001), and significantly negatively correlated with ethnocentrism (p < 0.001). The factors that significantly affected cultural competence were cultural intelligence (\u03b2 = 0.31, p < 0.001) and global competence (\u03b2 = 0.37, p < 0.001). The explanatory power of these effects was 47.3%. To improve the cultural competence of nursing students, it is necessary to develop, apply, and evaluate the results of curriculum and programs that can enhance the cultural intelligence and global competence of nursing students.", "This systematic review summarises and evaluates the literature investigating associations between exposure to air pollution and general population cognition, which has important implications for health, social and economic inequalities, and human productivity.\nThe engines MEDLINE, Embase Classic+Embase, APA PsycInfo, and SCOPUS were searched up to May 2022. Our inclusion criteria focus on the following pollutants: particulate matter, NOx, and ozone. The cognitive abilities of interest are: general/global cognition, executive function, attention, working memory, learning, memory, intelligence and IQ, reasoning, reaction times, and processing speed. The collective evidence was assessed using the NTP-OHAT framework and random-effects meta-analyses.\nEighty-six studies were identified, the results of which were generally supportive of associations between exposures and worsened cognition, but the literature was varied and sometimes contradictory. There was moderate certainty support for detrimental associations between PM2.5 and general cognition in adults 40+, and PM2.5, NOx, and PM10 and executive function (especially working memory) in children. There was moderate certainty evidence against associations between ozone and general cognition in adults age 40+, and NOx and reasoning/IQ in children. Some associations were also supported by meta-analysis (N = 14 studies, all in adults aged 40+). A 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in NO2 was associated with reduced performance on general cognitive batteries (\u03b2 = -0.02, p < 0.05) as was a 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure (\u03b2 = -0.02, p < 0.05). A 1\u03bcgm3 increase in PM2.5 was significantly associated with lower verbal fluency by -0.05 words (p = 0.01) and a decrease in executive function task performance of -0.02 points (p < 0.001).\nEvidence was found in support of some exposure-outcome associations, however more good quality research is required, particularly with older teenagers and young adults (14-40 years), using multi-exposure modelling, incorporating mechanistic investigation, and in South America, Africa, South Asia and Australasia.", "Procedures and actions such as injections and immobilization cause distress to children. In the pediatric field, there is a need for interventions and support to alleviate the pain and distress caused by such medical procedures. In recent years, the introduction of robots as a means of distraction has begun to be attempted.\nIn this study, we conducted a non-randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of intervention using 'aibo', a dog-like robot which has artificial intelligence (AI), to promote distraction in children after vaccination. Children between the ages of 3 and 12\u00a0years old eligible for the Japanese encephalitis vaccine, and their caregivers were assigned to intervention group or control group. Then, children evaluated their pain and children's behavior were observed by observer. The mean values of Faces pain rating scale scores and observer pain scale scores were compared between groups using an unpaired t-test.\nFifty-seven children (32 in the intervention group) participated in the study. Results of a t-test with the control group showed that the intervention group using aibo had significantly less pain following the post-vaccination intervention than the control group using stuffed dog (Face Scale, t(55)\u2009=\u20092.582, p\u2009=\u2009.0125; Behavioral Observation Scale, t(55)\u2009=\u20092.772, p\u2009=\u2009.00759). The results support the hypothesis that the aibo intervention group will be less distressed and able to calm down more quickly after vaccination than the control group.\nInteractive communicative play intervention by an artificially intelligent aibo before and after painful and frightening medical procedures may alleviate fear and anxiety and prevent medical trauma in children.", "Mammography yields inevitable recall for indeterminate findings that need to be confirmed with additional views.\nTo explore whether the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for mammography can reduce false-positive recall in patients who undergo the spot compression view.\nFrom January to December 2017, 236 breasts from 225 women who underwent the spot compression view due to focal asymmetry, mass, or architectural distortion on standard digital mammography were included. Three readers who were blinded to the study purpose, patient information, previous mammograms, following spot compression views, and any clinical or pathologic reports retrospectively reviewed 236 standard mammograms and determined the necessity of patient recall and the probability of malignancy per breast, first without and then with AI assistance. The performances of AI and the readers were evaluated with the recall rate, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.\nAmong 236 examinations, 8 (3.4%) were cancers and 228 (96.6%) were benign. The recall rates of all three readers significantly decreased with AI assistance (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The reader-averaged recall rates significantly decreased with AI assistance regardless of breast composition (fatty breasts: 32.7% to 24.1%m P\u2009=\u20090.002; dense breasts: 33.6% to 21.2%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The reader-averaged AUC increased with AI assistance and was comparable to that of standalone AI (0.835 vs. 0.895; P\u2009=\u20090.234). The reader-averaged specificity (71.2% to 79.8%, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and accuracy (71.3% to 79.7%, P\u2009<\u20090.001) significantly improved with AI assistance.\nAI assistance significantly reduced false-positive recall without compromising cancer detection in women with focal asymmetry, mass, or architectural distortion on standard digital mammography regardless of mammographic breast density.", "Advances in artificial intelligence deep learning (DL) have made tremendous impacts on the field of ocular imaging over the last few years. Specifically, DL has been utilised to detect and classify various ocular diseases on retinal photographs, optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, and OCT-angiography images. In order to achieve good robustness and generalisability of model performance, DL training strategies traditionally require extensive and diverse training datasets from various sites to be transferred and pooled into a \"centralised location\". However, such a data transferring process could raise practical concerns related to data security and patient privacy. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed collaborative learning paradigm which enables the coordination of multiple collaborators without the need for sharing confidential data. This distributed training approach has great potential to ensure data privacy among different institutions and reduce the potential risk of data leakage from data pooling or centralisation. This review article aims to introduce the concept of FL, provide current evidence of FL in ocular imaging, and discuss potential challenges as well as future applications.", "There is evidence of an association between hypertension and retinal arteriolar narrowing. Manual measurement of retinal vessels comes with additional variability, which can be eliminated using automated software. This scoping review aims to summarize research on automated retinal vessel analysis systems. Searches were performed on Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane to find studies examining automated systems for the diagnosis of retinal vascular alterations caused by hypertension using the following keywords: diagnosis; diagnostic screening programs; image processing, computer-assisted; artificial intelligence; electronic data processing; hypertensive retinopathy; hypertension; retinal vessels; arteriovenous ratio and retinal image analysis. The searches generated 433 articles. Of these, 25 articles published from 2010 to 2022 were included in the review. The retinographies analyzed were extracted from international databases and real scenarios. Automated systems to detect alterations in the retinal vasculature are being introduced into clinical practice for diagnosis in ophthalmology and other medical specialties due to the association of such changes with various diseases. These systems make the classification of hypertensive retinopathy and cardiovascular risk more reliable. They also make it possible for diagnosis to be performed in primary care, thus optimizing ophthalmological visits.", "Objectives: To analyze serial changes in body composition and investigate the association between body composition changes and disease activity changes in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). Methods: Seventy-one patients with CD who had been treated and followed-up at our institution were included. Two to four computed tomography images were acquired at baseline, and the 2\u22125-year, 5\u22128-year, and last follow-ups were selected per patient for body composition and disease activity analyses. Visceral fat area (VFA), skeletal muscle index (SMI; skeletal muscle area/height2), and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were assessed using an artificial-intelligence-driven fully automated method. Disease activity was assessed using a modified computed tomography scoring system and the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn\u2019s Disease. The associations between body composition, disease activity, and remission were investigated. Results: The mean age was 29.83 \u00b1 11.27 years; most patients were men (48/71, 67.6%); and the median follow-up was 144 (12\u2212264) months. Overall, VFA and SFA gradually increased, while SMI decreased during the follow-up. Sarcopenia was associated with the female sex, higher disease activities at baseline (p = 0.01) and the last follow-up (p = 0.001). SMI and SFA inversely correlated with the disease activity, i.e., the more severe the disease activity, the lower the SMI and SFA (p < 0.05). SMI at the last follow-up was the only significant predictor of remission (OR = 1.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.03\u22121.42, p = 0.021). Conclusion: SMI decreased while VFA and SFA increased during the treatment follow-up in patients with CD. Sarcopenia was associated with higher disease activity, and SMI and SFA inversely correlated with disease activity. SMI at the last follow-up was the significant factor for remission.", "The Gleason grading system is an important clinical practice for diagnosing prostate cancer in pathology images. However, this analysis results in significant variability among pathologists, hence creating possible negative clinical impacts. Artificial intelligence methods can be an important support for the pathologist, improving Gleason grade classifications. Consequently, our purpose is to construct and evaluate the potential of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Gleason patterns.\nThe methodology included 6982 image patches with cancer, extracted from radical prostatectomy specimens previously analyzed by an expert uropathologist. A CNN was constructed to accurately classify the corresponding Gleason. The evaluation was carried out by computing the corresponding 3 classes confusion matrix; thus, calculating the percentage of precision, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as the overall accuracy. Additionally, k-fold three-way cross-validation was performed to enhance evaluation, allowing better interpretation and avoiding possible bias.\nThe overall accuracy reached 98% for the training and validation stage, and 94% for the test phase. Considering the test samples, the true positive ratio between pathologist and computer method was 85%, 93%, and 96% for specific Gleason patterns. Finally, precision, sensitivity, and specificity reached values up to 97%.\nThe CNN model presented and evaluated has shown high accuracy for specifically pattern neighbors and critical Gleason patterns. The outcomes are in line and complement others in the literature. The promising results surpassed current inter-pathologist congruence in classical reports, evidencing the potential of this novel technology in daily clinical aspects.", "Intelligence scores in males with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) remain a major issue in clinical practice. We performed a literature review and meta-analysis to further delineate the intellectual functioning of dystrophinopathies.\nPublished, peer-reviewed articles assessing intelligence, using Wechsler Scales, of males with DMD or BMD were searched from 1960 to 2022. Meta-analysis with random-effects models was conducted, assessing weighted, mean effect sizes of full-scale IQ (FSIQ) scores relative to normative data (Mean = 100, Standard Deviation = 15). Post hoc we analysed differences between performance and verbal intelligence scores.\n43 studies were included, reporting data on 1472 males with dystrophinopathies; with FSIQ scores available for 1234 DMD (k = 32) and 101 BMD (k = 7). DMD males score, on average, one standard deviation below average (FSIQ = 84.76) and significantly lower than BMD (FSIQ = 92.11). Compared to a previous meta-analysis published in 2001, we find, on average, significantly higher FSIQ scores in DMD.\nMales with Duchenne have, on average, significantly lower FSIQ scores than BMD males and the general population. Clinicians must consider lower intelligence in dystrophinopathies to ensure good clinical practice.", "Background: This study aims to compare an automated cephalometric analysis based on the latest deep learning method of automatically identifying cephalometric landmarks with a manual tracing method using broadly accepted cephalometric software. Methods: A total of 100 cephalometric X-rays taken using a CS8100SC cephalostat were collected from a private practice. The X-rays were taken in maximum image size (18 \u00d7 24 cm lateral image). All cephalometric X-rays were first manually traced using the Dolphin 3D Imaging program version 11.0 and then automatically, using the Artificial Intelligence CS imaging V8 software. The American Board of Orthodontics analysis and the European Board of Orthodontics analysis were used for the cephalometric measurements. This resulted in the identification of 16 cephalometric landmarks, used for 16 angular and 2 linear measurements. Results: All measurements showed great reproducibility with high intra-class reliability (>0.97). The two methods showed great agreement, with an ICC range of 0.70\u22120.92. Mean values of SNA, SNB, ANB, SN-MP, U1-SN, L1-NB, SNPg, ANPg, SN/ANS-PNS, SN/GoGn, U1/ANS-PNS, L1-APg, U1-NA, and L1-GoGn landmarks had no significant differences between the two methods (p > 0.0027), while the mean values of FMA, L1-MP, ANS-PNS/GoGn, and U1-L1 were statistically significantly different (p < 0.0027). Conclusions: The automatic cephalometric tracing method using CS imaging V8 software is reliable and accurate for all cephalometric measurements.", "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a late microvascular complication of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) that could lead to permanent blindness in patients, without early detection. Although adequate management of DM via regular eye examination can preserve vision in in 98% of the DR cases, DR screening and diagnoses based on clinical lesion features devised by expert clinicians; are costly, time-consuming and not sufficiently accurate. This raises the requirements for Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems which can accurately detect DR automatically and thus preventing DR before affecting vision. Hence, such systems can help clinician experts in certain cases and aid ophthalmologists in rapid diagnoses. To address such requirements, several approaches have been proposed in the literature that use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to develop such systems. However, these approaches ignore the highly valuable clinical lesion features that could contribute significantly to the accurate detection of DR. Therefore, in this study we introduce a framework called DR-detector that employs the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML model trained via the combination of the features extracted by the pretrained convolutional neural networks commonly known as transfer learning (TL) models and the clinical retinal lesion features for accurate detection of DR. The retinal lesion features are extracted via image segmentation technique using the UNET DL model and captures exudates (EXs), microaneurysms (MAs), and hemorrhages (HEMs) that are relevant lesions for DR detection. The feature combination approach implemented in DR-detector has been applied to two common TL models in the literature namely VGG-16 and ResNet-50. We trained the DR-detector model using a training dataset comprising of 1,840 color fundus images collected from e-ophtha, retinal lesions and APTOS 2019 Kaggle datasets of which 920 images are healthy. To validate the DR-detector model, we test the model on external dataset that consists of 81 healthy images collected from High-Resolution Fundus (HRF) dataset and MESSIDOR-2 datasets and 81 images with DR signs collected from Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRID) dataset annotated for DR by expert. The experimental results show that the DR-detector model achieves a testing accuracy of 100% in detecting DR after training it with the combination of ResNet-50 and lesion features and 99.38% accuracy after training it with the combination of VGG-16 and lesion features. More importantly, the results also show a higher contribution of specific lesion features toward the performance of the DR-detector model. For instance, using only the hemorrhages feature to train the model, our model achieves an accuracy of 99.38 in detecting DR, which is higher than the accuracy when training the model with the combination of all lesion features (89%) and equal to the accuracy when training the model with the combination of all lesions and VGG-16 features together. This highlights the possibility of using only the clinical features, such as lesions that are clinically interpretable, to build the next generation of robust artificial intelligence (AI) systems with great clinical interpretability for DR detection. The code of the DR-detector framework is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Janga-Lab/DR-detector and can be readily employed for detecting DR from retinal image datasets.", "Air pollution, outdoor residential environment, indoor household characteristics, and parental mental health are potential factors associated with child development. However, few studies have simultaneously analyzed the association between the aforementioned factors and preschool child (aged 2-5 years) development. This study investigated the effects of those factors on child development and their potential modifying effects. A total of 142 participants were recruited from a birth cohort study in the Greater Taipei Area, and the evaluation was conducted at each participant's home from 2017 to 2020. Child cognitive development was assessed by psychologists using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development and the Wechsler Preschool & Primary Scale of Intelligence. Household air pollutants, outdoor residential environment, indoor household characteristics, parental mental health, and other covariates were evaluated. Multiple regressions were used to examine the relationships between child development and covariates. Stratified analysis by child sex and parental mental health was conducted. Average indoor air pollutant levels were below Taiwan's Indoor Air Quality Standards. After adjustment for covariates, the indoor total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) level was significantly associated with poor child development (per interquartile range increase in the TVOC level was associated with a 5.1 percentile decrease in child cognitive development). Sex difference was observed for the association between TVOC exposure and child development. Living near schools, burning incense at home, purchasing new furniture, and parental anxiety were related to child development. Indoor TVOC level was associated with poor child cognitive development, specifically with the girls. Indoor and outdoor residential environment and parental anxiety interfered with child development. TVOCs should be used cautiously at home to minimize child exposure. A low-pollution living environment should be provided to ensure children's healthy development.", "The ageing population has led to a surge in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in elderly healthcare worldwide. However, in the advancement of AI technologies, there is currently a lack of clarity about the types and roles of AI technologies in elderly healthcare. This scoping review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of AI technologies in elderly healthcare by exploring the types of AI technologies employed, and identifying their roles in elderly healthcare based on existing studies. A total of 10 databases were searched for this review, from January 1 2000 to July 31 2022. Based on the inclusion criteria, 105 studies were included. The AI devices utilized in elderly healthcare were summarised as robots, exoskeleton devices, intelligent homes, AI-enabled health smart applications and wearables, voice-activated devices, and virtual reality. Five roles of AI technologies were identified: rehabilitation therapists, emotional supporters, social facilitators, supervisors, and cognitive promoters. Results showed that the impact of AI technologies on elderly healthcare is promising and that AI technologies are capable of satisfying the unmet care needs of older adults and demonstrating great potential in its further development in this area. More well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed in the future to validate the roles of AI technologies in elderly healthcare.", "The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the emergence of many new technologies in the healthcare industry. In dentistry, the patient's panoramic radiographic or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are used for implant placement planning to find the correct implant position and eliminate surgical risks. This study aims to develop a deep learning-based model that detects missing teeth's position on a dataset segmented from CBCT images. Five hundred CBCT images were included in this study. After preprocessing, the datasets were randomized and divided into 70% training, 20% validation, and 10% test data. A total of six pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models were used in this study, which includes AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV3. In addition, the proposed models were tested with/without applying the segmentation technique. Regarding the normal teeth class, the performance of the proposed pretrained DL models in terms of precision was above 0.90. Moreover, the experimental results showed the superiority of DenseNet169 with a precision of 0.98. In addition, other models such as MobileNetV3, VGG19, ResNet50, VGG16, and AlexNet obtained a precision of 0.95, 0.94, 0.94, 0.93, and 0.92, respectively. The DenseNet169 model performed well at the different stages of CBCT-based detection and classification with a segmentation accuracy of 93.3% and classification of missing tooth regions with an accuracy of 89%. As a result, the use of this model may represent a promising time-saving tool serving dental implantologists with a significant step toward automated dental implant planning.", "Mental health assessments that combine patients' facial expressions and behaviors have been proven effective, but screening large-scale student populations for mental health problems is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study aims to provide an efficient and accurate intelligent method for further psychological diagnosis and treatment, which combines artificial intelligence technologies to assist in evaluating the mental health problems of college students.\nWe propose a mixed-method study of mental health assessment that combines psychological questionnaires with facial emotion analysis to comprehensively evaluate the mental health of students on a large scale. The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21(DASS-21) is used for the psychological questionnaire. The facial emotion recognition model is implemented by transfer learning based on neural networks, and the model is pre-trained using FER2013 and CFEE datasets. Among them, the FER2013 dataset consists of 48 \u00d7 48-pixel face gray images, a total of 35,887 face images. The CFEE dataset contains 950,000 facial images with annotated action units (au). Using a random sampling strategy, we sent online questionnaires to 400 college students and received 374 responses, and the response rate was 93.5%. After pre-processing, 350 results were available, including 187 male and 153 female students. First, the facial emotion data of students were collected in an online questionnaire test. Then, a pre-trained model was used for emotion recognition. Finally, the online psychological questionnaire scores and the facial emotion recognition model scores were collated to give a comprehensive psychological evaluation score.\nThe experimental results of the facial emotion recognition model proposed to show that its classification results are broadly consistent with the mental health survey results. This model can be used to improve efficiency. In particular, the accuracy of the facial emotion recognition model proposed in this paper is higher than that of the general mental health model, which only uses the traditional single questionnaire. Furthermore, the absolute errors of this study in the three symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress are lower than other mental health survey results and are only 0.8%, 8.1%, 3.5%, and 1.8%, respectively.\nThe mixed method combining intelligent methods and scales for mental health assessment has high recognition accuracy. Therefore, it can support efficient large-scale screening of students' psychological problems.", "Recent advances in deep learning have enhanced medical imaging research. Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women, and many applications have been developed to improve its early detection. The purpose of this review is to examine how various deep learning methods can be applied to breast cancer screening workflows. We summarize deep learning methods, data availability and different screening methods for breast cancer including mammography, thermography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. In this review, we will explore deep learning in diagnostic breast imaging and describe the literature review. As a conclusion, we discuss some of the limitations and opportunities of integrating artificial intelligence into breast cancer clinical practice.", "Background and Objectives: The present study evaluated the detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) using an automated fundus camera focusing exclusively on retinal hemorrhage (RH) using a deep convolutional neural network, which is a machine-learning technology. Materials and Methods: This investigation was conducted via a prospective and observational study. The study included 89 fundus ophthalmoscopy images. Seventy images passed an image quality review and were graded as showing no apparent DR (n = 51), mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR; n = 16), moderate NPDR (n = 1), severe NPDR (n = 1), and proliferative DR (n = 1) by three retinal experts according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Severity scale. The RH numbers and areas were automatically detected and the results of two tests-the detection of mild-or-worse NPDR and the detection of moderate-or-worse NPDR-were examined. Results: The detection of mild-or-worse DR showed a sensitivity of 0.812 (95% confidence interval: 0.680-0.945), specificity of 0.888, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.884, whereas the detection of moderate-or-worse DR showed a sensitivity of 1.0, specificity of 1.0, and AUC of 1.0. Conclusions: Automated diagnosis using artificial intelligence focusing exclusively on RH could be used to diagnose DR requiring ophthalmologist intervention.", "With the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based health interventions, systemic racism remains a concern as these advancements are frequently developed without race-specific data analysis or validation. To evaluate the potential utility of an AI-based cardiovascular diseases (CVD) screening tool in an under-resourced African-American cohort, we reviewed the AI-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG) data of participants enrolled in a community-based clinical trial as a proof-of-concept ancillary study for community-based screening.\nEnrollees completed cardiovascular testing including standard 12-lead ECG and a limited echocardiogram (TTE). All ECGs were analyzed using previously published institution-based AI algorithms. AI-ECG predictions were generated for age, sex, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Diagnostic accuracy of the AI-ECG for decreased LVEF and sex was quantified using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Correlation between actual age and AI-ECG predicted age was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients.\nFifty-four participants completed both an ECG and TTE (mean age 55 years [range 31-87 years]; 66.7% female). All participants were in sinus rhythm, and the median LVEF of the cohort was 60-65%. The AI-ECG for decreased LVEF demonstrated excellent performance with an AUC of 0.892 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.708-1); sensitivity=50% (95% CI 9.5-90.5%; n=1/2) and specificity=96% (95% CI 86.8-98.9%; n=49/51). The AI-ECG for participant sex demonstrated similar performance with AUC of 0.944 (95% CI 0.891-0.998); sensitivity=100% (95% CI 82.4-100.0%; n=18/18) and specificity=77.8% (95% CI 61.9-88.3%; n=28/36). The AI-ECG predicted mean age was 55 years (range 26.9-72.6 years) with a strong correlation to actual age (R=0.769; p<0.001).\nOur analyses of previously developed AI-ECG algorithms for prediction of age, sex, and decreased LVEF demonstrated reliable performance in this community-based, African-American cohort. This novel, community-centric delivery of AI could provide valuable screening resources and appropriate referrals for early detection of highly-morbid CVD for under-resourced patient populations.", "Given the recent success of artificial intelligence (AI) in computer vision applications, many pathologists anticipate that AI will be able to assist them in a variety of digital pathology tasks. Simultaneously, tremendous advancements in deep learning have enabled a synergy with artificial intelligence (AI), allowing for image-based diagnosis on the background of digital pathology. There are efforts for developing AI-based tools to save pathologists time and eliminate errors. Here, we describe the elements in the development of computational pathology (CPATH), its applicability to AI development, and the challenges it faces, such as algorithm validation and interpretability, computing systems, reimbursement, ethics, and regulations. Furthermore, we present an overview of novel AI-based approaches that could be integrated into pathology laboratory workflows.", "The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB), founding member of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), is the US data center for the open-access PDB archive.

A predictive approach to studying treatment-related adverse events (AEs) may generate proactive strategies; however, many studies are descriptive in nature. Focusing on short-term AEs, we determine the performance of prediction models of disease- or treatment-related AEs among women diagnosed with BCa.\nWe used administrative claims data from the Blue Health Intelligence National Data Repository. The study sample included female individuals age 18 years and older who were diagnosed with BCa and received cancer-directed treatment between January 1, 2014, and August 1, 2019. Using the information available in the claims data, we constructed longitudinal patient histories and identified disease- and treatment-related AEs occurring within 6 months of treatment. The following prediction models were developed: logistic regression, Lasso regression, gradient boosted tree (GBT), and random forest (RF). We compared models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and its CI, among other metrics.\nData were extracted for 267,473 members meeting study inclusion criteria. The area under the curve for the logistic regression model was 0.82 (0.82-0.86), compared with 0.89 (0.87-0.90) for the Lasso, 0.91 (0.89-0.93) for the GBT, and 0.90 (0.93-0.89) for the RF models. The sensitivity was 0.96 for the GBT, Lasso, and RF models, whereas the specificity was 0.42, 0.44, and 0.39 for the GBT, Lasso, and RF models, respectively. Positive predictive values were 0.96 across all three models.\nPrediction models developed using big data methods and grounded in a clinically guided framework have the potential to reliably predict short-term treatment-related AEs among women diagnosed with BCa.", "Sulforaphane has been reported to possibly improve core symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders from mostly small size studies. Here we present results of a larger randomized clinical trial (N\u2009=\u2009108) in China. There were no significant changes in caregiver rated scales between sulforaphane and placebo groups. However, clinician rated scales showed a significant improvement in the sulforaphane group, and one third of participants showed at least a 30% decrease in score by 12\u00a0weeks treatment. The effects of sulforaphane were seen across the full range of intelligence and greater in participants over 10\u00a0years. Sulforaphane was safe and well-tolerated even for young children. The inconsistent results between caregiver and clinician rated scales suggest more clinical trials are needed to confirm our findings.", "Hypospadias remains the most prevalent congenital abnormality in boys worldwide. However, the limited infrastructure and number of pediatric urologists capable of diagnosing and managing the condition hinder the management of hypospadias in Indonesia. The use of artificial intelligence and image recognition is thought to be beneficial in improving the management of hypospadias cases in Indonesia.\nWe aim to develop and validate a digital pattern recognition system and a mobile app based on an artificial neural network to determine various parameters of hypospadias.\nHypospadias and normal penis images from an age-matched database will be used to train the artificial neural network. Images of 3 aspects of the penis (ventral, dorsal, and lateral aspects, which include the glans, shaft, and scrotum) will be taken from each participant. The images will be labeled with the following hypospadias parameters: hypospadias status, meatal location, meatal shape, the quality of the urethral plate, glans diameter, and glans shape. The data will be uploaded to train the image recognition model. Intrarater and interrater analyses will be performed, using the test images provided to the algorithm.\nOur study is at the protocol development stage.

Therefore, this study explored which measures of executive functions (EF) may lead to a better diagnostic prediction and evaluated whether participants were adequately assigned to the ADHD group based on the identified predictors. Seventeen 6- to 10-year-old children with ADHD were matched with 17 typically developing peers (TD) by age, gender, and non-verbal intelligence. Performance-based measures and behavior ratings of 'cool' and 'hot' EF were used. As expected, there was a significant group effect on the linear combination of measures, indicating that children with ADHD showed significant difficulties with EF compared to the TD group. In fact, significant differences were found in measures of short-term and working memory, planning, delay aversion, and EF-related behaviors, as reported by parents and teachers. However, the discriminant function analysis only revealed three significant predictors: the General Executive Composite of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (Parent and Teacher Forms) and the Delay of Gratification Task, with 97.1% correct classifications. These findings highlight the importance and contribution of both behavioral ratings and 'hot' measures of EF for the characterization of ADHD in children.", "The aim of the present study was to test the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test for children in the 5-9 age group and to determine the psychometric attributes of this tool. Intelligence is a complex and abstract concept. Therefore, it is not possible to observe or measure directly. However, it helps experts to have an idea about the intelligence levels of people with the evaluation scales used. Nonverbal ability tests are also one of the assessment scale types used for this purpose.\nThe study was conducted based on the general survey model. One district from each socioeconomic development region was selected via random assignment taking as a basis the socioeconomic development listing for the districts. The study was carried out with 753 children from 4 different socioeconomic development regions. Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test, Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-3, Colored Progressive Matrices Test, and Denver II Developmental Screening Test were used for data collection. Cronbach Alpha reliability, test-retest reliability, and parallel form reliability were calculated during Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test reliability analyses. For validity analysis, the level of correlation between Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test and Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-3 and Colored Progressive Matrices Test tests was examined.\nIt was determined that Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test has high reliability with an average reliability coefficient of .88. High correlation was observed between the A and B forms of Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test A (r\u2009=\u20090.93, P < .001) and during the test-retest analyses (0.87, 0.88). A statistically significant difference was determined between the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test scores and class level and age group, while a statistically significant difference could not be determined based on gender. A high, positive, and statistically significant correlation was determined between Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test and Colored Progressive Matrices Test (r\u2009=\u20090.84, P < .001), whereas a moderate, positive, and statistically significant correlation was determined between Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test and Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-3 (r\u2009=\u20090.52, P < .001).\nThe findings illustrate that Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test is a valid and reliable intelligence test for measuring general intellectual ability and for assessing reasoning skills.", "Advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep neural networks have led to new discoveries in human and animal learning and intelligence. A recent artificial intelligence agent in the DeepMind family, muZero, can complete a variety of tasks with limited information about the world in which it is operating and with high uncertainty about features of current and future space. To perform, muZero uses only three functions that are general yet specific enough to allow learning across a variety of tasks without overgeneralization across different contexts. Similarly, humans and animals are able to learn and improve in complex environments while transferring learning from other contexts and without overgeneralizing. In particular, the mammalian extrahippocampal system (eHPCS) can guide spatial decision making while simultaneously encoding and processing spatial and contextual information. Like muZero, the eHPCS is also able to adjust contextual representations depending on the degree and significance of environmental changes and environmental cues. In this opinion, we will argue that the muZero functions parallel those of the hippocampal system. We will show that the different components of the muZero model provide a framework for thinking about generalizable learning in the eHPCS, and that the evaluation of how transitions in cell representations occur between similar and distinct contexts can be informed by advances in artificial intelligence agents such as muZero. We additionally explain how advances in AI agents will provide frameworks and predictions by which to investigate the expected link between state changes and neuronal firing. Specifically, we will discuss testable predictions about the eHPCS, including the functions of replay and remapping, informed by the mechanisms behind muZero learning. We conclude with additional ways in which agents such as muZero can aid in illuminating prospective questions about neural functioning, as well as how these agents may shed light on potential expected answers.", "Aiming at the 1vs1 confrontation problem in a complex environment where obstacles are randomly distributed, the DDPG (deep deterministic policy gradient) algorithm is used to design the maneuver decision-making method of UAVs. Traditional methods generally assume that all obstacles are known globally. In this paper, a UAV airborne lidar detection model is designed, which can effectively solve the problem of obstacle avoidance when facing a large number of unknown obstacles. On the basis of the designed model, the idea of transfer learning is used to transfer the strategy trained by one UAV in a simple task to a new similar task, and the strategy will be used to train the strategy of the other UAV. This method can improve the intelligence of the UAVs in both sides alternately and progressively. The simulation results show that the transfer learning method can speed up the training process and improve the training effect.", "Our planet is currently facing unprecedented interconnected environmental, societal, and economic dilemmas due to climate change, the outbreak of pandemics and wars, among others. These global challenges pose direct threats to food security and safety and clearly show the urgent need for innovative scientific solutions and technological approaches. Backed by the current alarming situation, many food-related trends have emerged in recent years in response to these global issues. This review looks at two megatrends in agriculture and the food industry; the shift to vegetable diets and the digital transformation in food production and consumption patterns. On one side, several innovative technologies and protein sources have been associated with more sustainable food systems and enhanced nutritional quality and safety. On the other side, many digital advanced technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and 3D printing) have been increasingly applied in smart farms and smart food factories to improve food system outcomes. Increasing adoption of vegetal innovations and harnessing Industry 4.0 technologies along the food supply chain have the potential to enable efficient digital and ecological transitions.", "This study aimed to gain insight into radiographers' views on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in Saudi Arabia by conducting a qualitative investigation designed to provide recommendations to assist radiographic workforce improvement.\nWe conducted an online cross-sectional online survey of Saudi radiographers regarding perspectives on AI implementation, job security, workforce development, and ethics.\nIn total, 562 valid responses were received. Most respondents (90.6%) believed that AI was the direction of diagnostic imaging. Among the respondents, 88.5% stated that AI would improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Some challenges in implementing AI in Saudi Arabia include the high cost of equipment, inadequate knowledge, radiologists' fear of losing employment, and concerns related to potential medical errors and cyber threats.\nRadiographers were generally positive about introducing AI to radiology departments. To integrate AI successfully into radiology departments, radiographers need training programs, transparent policies, and motivation.", "Compound-protein interaction (CPI) plays an essential role in drug discovery and is performed via expensive molecular docking simulations. Many artificial intelligence-based approaches have been proposed in this regard. Recently, two types of models have accomplished promising results in exploiting molecular information: graph convolutional neural networks that construct a learned molecular representation from a graph structure (atoms and bonds), and neural networks that can be applied to compute on descriptors or fingerprints of molecules. However, the superiority of one method over the other is yet to be determined. Modern studies have endeavored to aggregate information that is extracted from compounds and proteins to form the CPI task. Nonetheless, these approaches have used a simple concatenation to combine them, which cannot fully capture the interaction between such information.\nWe propose the Perceiver CPI network, which adopts a cross-attention mechanism to improve the learning ability of the representation of drug and target interactions and exploits the rich information obtained from extended-connectivity fingerprints to improve the performance. We evaluated Perceiver CPI on three main datasets, Davis, KIBA and Metz, to compare the performance of our proposed model with that of state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method achieved satisfactory performance and exhibited significant improvements over previous approaches in all experiments.\nPerceiver CPI is available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/PerceiverCPI.\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "For prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated with definitive radiotherapy (RT), acute and late RT-related genitourinary (GU) toxicities adversely impact disease-specific quality of life. Early warning of potential RT toxicities can prompt interventions that may prevent or mitigate future adverse events. During intensity modulated RT (IMRT) of PCa, daily cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are used to improve treatment accuracy through image guidance. This work investigated the performance of CBCT-based delta-radiomic features (DRF) models to predict acute and sub-acute International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 GU toxicity grades for 50\u00a0PCa patients treated with definitive RT. Delta-radiomics models were built using logistic regression, random forest for feature selection, and a 1000 iteration bootstrapping leave one analysis for cross validation. To our knowledge, no prior studies of PCa have used DRF models based on daily CBCT images. AUC of 0.83 for IPSS and greater than 0.7 for CTCAE grades were achieved as early as week 1 of treatment. DRF extracted from CBCT images showed promise for the development of models predictive of RT outcomes. Future studies will include using artificial intelligence and machine learning to expand CBCT sample sizes available for radiomics analysis.", "The edge computing paradigm has recently drawn significant attention from industry and academia. Due to the advantages in quality-of-service metrics, namely, latency, bandwidth, energy efficiency, privacy, and security, deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models at the network edge has attracted widespread interest. Edge-AI has seen applications in diverse domains that involve large amounts of data. However, poor dataset quality plagues this compute regime owing to numerous data corruption sources, including missing data. As such systems are increasingly being deployed in mission-critical applications, mitigating the effects of corrupted data becomes important. In this work, we propose a strategy based on data imputation using neural inversion, DINI. It trains a surrogate model and runs data imputation in an interleaved fashion. Unlike previous works, DINI is a model-agnostic framework applicable to diverse deep learning architectures. DINI outperforms state-of-the-art methods by at least 10.7% in average imputation error. Applying DINI to mission-critical applications can increase prediction accuracy to up to 99% (F1 score of 0.99), resulting in significant gains compared to baseline methods.", "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care is increasing and has shown utility in many medical specialties, especially pathology, radiology, and oncology.\nMany barriers exist to successfully implement AI programs in the clinical setting. To address these barriers, a formal governing body, the hospital AI Committee, was created at James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital in Tampa, Florida. The AI committee reviews and assesses AI products based on their success at protecting human autonomy; promoting human well-being and safety and the public interest; ensuring transparency, explainability, and intelligibility; fostering responsibility and accountability; ensuring inclusiveness and equity; and promoting AI that is responsive and sustainable.\nThrough the hospital AI Committee, we may overcome many obstacles to successfully implementing AI applications in the clinical setting.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a crucial role in advancing biomedical sciences but has yet to have the impact it merits in regulatory science. As the field advances, in silico and in vitro approaches have been evaluated as alternatives to animal studies, in a drive to identify and mitigate safety concerns earlier in the drug development process. Although many AI tools are available, their acceptance in regulatory decision-making for drug efficacy and safety evaluation is still a challenge. It is a common perception that an AI model improves with more data, but does reality reflect this perception in drug safety assessments? Importantly, a model aiming at regulatory application needs to take a broad range of model characteristics into consideration. Among them is adaptability, defined as the adaptive behavior of a model as it is retrained on unseen data. This is an important model characteristic which should be considered in regulatory applications. In this study, we set up a comprehensive study to assess adaptability in AI by mimicking the real-world scenario of the annual addition of new drugs to the market, using a model we previously developed known as DeepDILI for predicting drug-induced liver injury (DILI) with a novel Deep Learning method. We found that the target test set plays a major role in assessing the adaptive behavior of our model. Our findings also indicated that adding more drugs to the training set does not significantly affect the predictive performance of our adaptive model. We concluded that the proposed adaptability assessment framework has utility in the evaluation of the performance of a model over time.", "Impairments and developmental delay are often reported in infants and young children with CHD. However, currently, there is no data regarding cognitive abilities assessed by standardised intelligence tests in adults with CHD. This study assesses the cognitive function in Fontan patients compared with acyanotic CHD patients whether restrictions in cognitive function are present in adulthood and its association with health-related quality of life.\nForty-four adult CHD (female n = 21 (47.7%); mean age 34.7 \u00b1 11.9 years), 22 with Fontan circulation and 22 with acyanotic CHD, underwent the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for adults as patients during routine follow-up in 2018. The Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) assessed health-related quality of life.\nFontan patients showed significantly better results in the FSIQ (p = 0.020) and perceptual reasoning (p = 0.017) in comparison with patients with acyanotic CHD. All adult CHD patients showed normal IQ in subscales and full-scale IQ (FSIQ). In health-related quality of life, no association with cognitive function was found and no significant difference between both CHD groups, but trends to reduced values in acyanotic adult CHD.\nInterestingly, our study results in adult Fontan patients showed that it is possible to live an adult life with normal cognitive function and good health-related quality of life with a univentricular heart. Thus, this study could be a guidepost for more in-depth studies on cognitive function in Fontan survivors. In addition, the focus should be on health-related quality of life of adult CHD with simple CHD in particular, since a reduced health-related quality of life is not only medically based.", "Satisfactory magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of those patients with involuntary head motion due to brain diseases is essential in avoiding missed diagnosis and guiding treatment.\nTo investigate the clinical feasibility of artificial intelligence-assisted compressed sensing single-shot fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (ACS-SS-FLAIR) in evaluating patients with involuntary head motion due to brain diseases, compared with the conventional T2-FLAIR with parallel imaging (PI-FLAIR).\nA total of 33 uncooperative patients with brain disease were prospectively enrolled. Two readers independently reviewed images acquired with ACS-SS-FLAIR and PI-FLAIR at a 3.0-T MR scanner. In the aspects of qualitative evaluation of image quality, overall image quality and lesion conspicuity of ACS-SS-FLAIR and PI-FLAIR were assessed and then statistically compared by paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For quantitative evaluation, the relative contrast of lesion-to-cerebral parenchyma were calculated and compared.\nOverall image quality scores of ACS-SS-FLAIR evaluated by two readers were 2.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.24 and 2.91\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29, respectively, both of which were significantly higher than that of PI-FLAIR, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001 and <0.001). Lesion conspicuity scores of were 2.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.47 and 2.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44, both of which were significantly higher than that of PI-FLAIR, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.001 and <0.001). In the quantitative evaluation for image quality, the relative contrast of lesion-to-cerebral parenchyma was 0.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09 in the ACS-SS-FLAIR sequence, significantly larger than that in the PI-FLAIR sequence (P\u2009=\u20090.001).\nThe ACS-SS-FLAIR sequence is clinically feasible in the MRI workup of those patients with involuntary head motion due to brain diseases, showing shorter image acquisition time and better image quality compared with conventional PI-FLAIR.", "The increased interest in assisted reproduction through in vitro fertilization (IVF) leads to an urgent need to identify biomarkers that reliably highly predict the success of pregnancy. Despite advances in diagnostics, treatment, and IVF approaches, the 30% success rate of IVF seems insurmountable. Idiopathic infertility does not have any explanation for IVF failure especially when a patient is treated with a healthy competitive embryo capable of implantation and development. Since appropriate intercellular communication is essential after embryo implantation, the emergence of the investigation of embryonic secretome including short non-coding RNA (sncRNA) molecules is crucial. That's why biomarker identification, sncRNAs secreted during the IVF process into the blastocyst's cultivation medium, by the implementation of artificial intelligence opens the door to a better understanding of the bidirectional communication between embryonic cells and the endometrium and so the success of the IVF. This study presents a set of promising new sncRNAs which are revealed to predictively distinguish a high-quality embryo, suitable for an embryo transfer in the IVF process, from a low-quality embryo with 86% accuracy. The identified exact combination of miRNAs/piRNAs as a non-invasively obtained biomarker for quality embryo determination, increasing the likelihood of implantation and the success of pregnancy after an embryo transfer.", "A major archetype of artificial intelligence is developing algorithms facilitating temporal efficiency and accuracy while boosting the generalization performance. Even with the latest developments in machine learning, a key limitation has been the inefficient feature extraction from the initial data, which is essential in performance optimization. Here, we introduce a feature extraction method inspired by energy-entropy relations of sensory cortical networks in the brain. Dubbed the brain-inspired cortex, the algorithm provides convergence to orthogonal features from streaming signals with superior computational efficiency while processing data in a compressed form. We demonstrate the performance of the new algorithm using artificially created complex data by comparing it with the commonly used traditional clustering algorithms, such as Birch, GMM, and K-means. While the data processing time is significantly reduced-seconds versus hours-encoding distortions remain essentially the same in the new algorithm, providing a basis for better generalization. Although we show herein the superior performance of the cortical coding model in clustering and vector quantization, it also provides potent implementation opportunities for machine learning fundamental components, such as reasoning, anomaly detection and classification in large scope applications, e.g., finance, cybersecurity, and healthcare.", "The pressure on the speed of information processing ranks business intelligence technologies among the fastest growing decision support tools. The main goal of this article is, applying the UTAUT 2 (the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology), to verify the factors determining the implementation of business intelligence tools in business processes, especially decision-making, and their subsequent optimal use in business practice. The researched scheme was modified according to the specifics of business intelligence tools and was supplemented by user behaviour in decision-making. The verification was performed using a questionnaire survey based on UTAUT 2 theory and 152 respondents were included in the analysis. According to the results, the most important variable of influence on both the behavioural intention and the users' behaviour itself in decision-making was the factor of habit. And surprisingly, some previously recognised links were not confirmed, especially the factors influencing the intention of behaviour (effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions). So, there is room after almost 10\u00a0years and experience gained during the Covid-19 pandemic to modify the latest version of a model.", "The detection of toxins that contaminate food needs highly sensitive and selective techniques to prevent substantial monitory loss. In this regard, various nanostructured material-enabled biosensors, have recently been developed to improve the detection of food toxins among them aflatoxin is the prevalent one. The biosensor-based detection of aflatoxin is quick, cheaper, and needs less skilled personnel, therefore overcoming the shortcomings of conventional techniques such as LC/MS-MS, HPLC, and ELISA assays. 2D MXenes manifest as an efficient material for biosensing due to their desirable biocompatibility, magnificent mechanical strength, easiness of surface functionalization, and tuneable optical and electronic features. Contrary to this, aptamers as biorecognition elements (BREs) possess high selectivity, sensitivity, and ease of synthesis when compared to conventional BREs. In this review, we explored the most cutting-edge aptamer-based MXene-enabled biosensing technologies for the detection of the most poisonous mycotoxins (i.e., Aflatoxins) in food and environmental matrices. The discussion begins with the synthesis processes and surface functionalization/modification of MXenes. Computational approaches for designing aptasensors and advanced data analysis based on artificial intelligence and machine learning with special emphasis over Internet-of-Thing integrated biosensing devices has been presented. Besides, the advantages of aptasensors over conventional methods along with their limitations have been briefed. Their benefits, drawbacks, and future potential are discussed concerning their analytical performance, utility, and on-site adaptability. Additionally, next-generation MXene-enabled biosensing technologies that provide end users with simple handling and improved sensitivity and selectivity have been emphasized. Owing to massive applicability, economic/commercial potential of MXene in current and future perspective have been highlighted. Finally, the existing difficulties are scrutinized and a roadmap for developing sophisticated biosensing technologies to detect toxins in various samples in the future is projected.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance health care efficiency and diagnostic accuracy.\nThe present study aimed to determine the current performance of AI using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images for detection and segmentation.\nA systematic search for scholarly articles written in English was conducted on June 24, 2021, in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed articles that evaluated AI systems using CBCT images for detection and segmentation purposes and achieved reported outcomes in terms of precision and recall, accuracy, based on DICE index and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The Cochrane tool for assessing the risk of bias was used to evaluate the studies that were included in this meta-analysis. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled effect size.\nThirteen studies were included for review and analysis. The pooled performance that measures the included AI models is 0.85 (95%CI: 0.73,0.92) for DICE index/DSC, 0.88 (0.77,0.94) for precision, 0.93 (0.84, 0.97) for recall, and 0.83 (0.68, 0.91) for accuracy percentage.\nSome limitations are identified in our meta-analysis such as heterogenicity of studies, risk of bias and lack of ground truth. The application of AI for detection and segmentation using CBCT images is comparable to services offered by trained dentists and can potentially expedite and enhance the interpretive process. Implementing AI into clinical dentistry can analyze a large number of CBCT studies and flag the ones with significant findings, thus increasing efficiency. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO, the international registry for systematic reviews (ID number CRD42021285095).", "The artificial intelligence-based structure prediction program AlphaFold-Multimer enabled structural modelling of protein complexes with unprecedented accuracy. Increasingly, AlphaFold-Multimer is also used to discover new protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Here, we present AlphaPulldown, a Python package that streamlines PPI screens and high-throughput modelling of higher-order oligomers using AlphaFold-Multimer. It provides a convenient command-line interface, a variety of confidence scores and a graphical analysis tool.\nAlphaPulldown is freely available at https://www.embl-hamburg.de/AlphaPulldown.\nSupplementary note is available at Bioinformatics online.", "Contrary to the common notion that personality and intelligence are unrelated constructs, numerous correlational studies have demonstrated substantial associations between the two domains. Moreover, samples of intellectually gifted individuals have been found to differ from the general population in specific aspects of their personalities. However, most studies so far have relied on the Five-Factor Model of Personality (FFM), while none have investigated this phenomenon using the HEXACO personality framework. We recruited 617 adult members of the international high-IQ society MENSA and compared them to 3 reference samples (combined N = 112,637) regarding their personalities as measured by the HEXACO-60 personality inventory. We found that gifted persons scored higher in Honesty-Humility and Conscientiousness but lower in Emotionality compared to reference samples. Interestingly, gifted individuals scored only slightly higher in Openness to Experience, and no consistent differences emerged for Agreeableness. We demonstrate that some known personality differences between gifted and non-gifted persons translate from the FFM to the HEXACO model, while others do not. Our results indicate that within the HEXACO factor structure differences in sociability are more pronounced, while intellect-related differences are comparatively weak.", "The problem of nowcasting extreme weather events can be addressed by applying either numerical methods for the solution of dynamic model equations or data-driven artificial intelligence algorithms. Within this latter framework, the most used techniques rely on video prediction deep learning methods which take in input time series of radar reflectivity images to predict the next future sequence of reflectivity images, from which the predicted rainfall quantities are extrapolated. Differently from the previous works, the present paper proposes a deep learning method, exploiting videos of radar reflectivity frames as input and lightning data to realize a warning machine able to sound timely alarms of possible severe thunderstorm events. The problem is recast in a classification one in which the extreme events to be predicted are characterized by a an high level of precipitation and lightning density. From a technical viewpoint, the computational core of this approach is an ensemble learning method based on the recently introduced value-weighted skill scores for both transforming the probabilistic outcomes of the neural network into binary predictions and assessing the forecasting performance. Such value-weighted skill scores are particularly suitable for binary predictions performed over time since they take into account the time evolution of events and predictions paying attention to the value of the prediction for the forecaster. The result of this study is a warning machine validated against weather radar data recorded in the Liguria region, in Italy.", "Technological innovations gained momentum and supported COVID-19 intelligence surveillance among high-risk populations globally. We examined technology surveillance using mobile thermometer detectors (MTDs), knowledge of App, and self-efficacy as a means of sensing body temperature as a measure of COVID-19 risk mitigation. In a cross-sectional survey, we explored COVID-19 risk mitigation, mobile temperature detectable by network syndromic surveillance mobility, detachable from clinicians, and laboratory diagnoses to elucidate the magnitude of community monitoring.\nIn a cross-sectional survey, we create in-depth comprehension of risk mitigation, mobile temperature Thermometer detector, and other variables for surveillance and monitoring among 850 university students and healthcare workers. An applied structural equation model was adopted for analysis with Amos v.24. We established that mobile usability knowledge of APP could effectively aid in COVID-19 intelligence risk mitigation. Moreover, both self-efficacy and mobile temperature positively strengthened data visualization for public health decision-making.\nThe algorithms utilize a validated point-of-center test to ascertain the HealthCode scanning system for a positive or negative COVID-19 notification. The MTD is an alternative personal self-testing procedure used to verify temperature rates based on previous SARS-CoV-2 and future mobility digital health. Personal self-care of MTD mobility and knowledge of mHealth apps can specifically manage COVID-19 mitigation in high or low terrestrial areas. We found mobile usability, mobile self-efficacy, and app knowledge were statistically significant to COVID-19 mitigation. Additionally, interaction strengthened the positive relationship between self-efficacy and COVID-19. Data aggregation is entrusted with government database agencies, using natural language processing and machine learning mechanisms to validate and analyze.\nThe study shows that temperature thermometer detectors, mobile usability, and knowledge of App enhanced COVID-19 risk mitigation in a high or low-risk environment. The standardizing dataset is necessary to ensure privacy and security preservation of data ethics.", "Quality control is essential to ensure the performance and yield of microdevices in industrial processing and manufacturing. In particular, 3D microscopy can be considered as a separate branch of microscopic instruments and plays a pivotal role in monitoring processing quality. For industrial measurements, 3D microscopy is mainly used for both the inspection of critical dimensions to ensure the design performance and detection of defects for improving the yield of microdevices. However, with the progress of advanced manufacturing technology and the increasing demand for high-performance microdevices, 3D microscopy has ushered in new challenges and development opportunities, such as breakthroughs in diffraction limit, 3D characterisation and calibrations of critical dimensions, high-precision detection and physical property determination of defects, and application of artificial intelligence. In this review, we provide a comprehensive survey about the state of the art and challenges in 3D microscopy for industrial measurements, and provide development ideas for future research. By describing techniques and methods with their advantages and limitations, we provide guidance to researchers and developers about the most suitable technique available for their intended industrial measurements.", "Rapid-paced development and adaptability of artificial intelligence algorithms have secured their almost ubiquitous presence in the field of oncological imaging. Artificial intelligence models have been created for a variety of tasks, including risk stratification, automated detection, and segmentation of lesions, characterization, grading and staging, prediction of prognosis, and treatment response. Soon, artificial intelligence could become an essential part of every step of oncological workup and patient management. Integration of neural networks and deep learning into radiological artificial intelligence algorithms allow for extrapolating imaging features otherwise inaccessible to human operators and pave the way to truly personalized management of oncological patients.Although a significant proportion of currently available artificial intelligence solutions belong to basic and translational cancer imaging research, their progressive transfer to clinical routine is imminent, contributing to the development of a personalized approach in oncology. We thereby review the main applications of artificial intelligence in oncological imaging, describe the example of their successful integration into research and clinical practice, and highlight the challenges and future perspectives that will shape the field of oncological radiology.", "Artificial intelligence and machine learning have enormous potential to deal efficiently with a wide range of issues that traditional sciences may be unable to address. Neuroscience, particularly psychiatry, is one of the domains that could potentially benefit from artificial intelligence and machine learning. This study aims to predict Stress and assess Coping with stress mechanisms during the COVID-19 pandemic and, therefore, help establish a successful intervention to manage distress.\nCOVIDiSTRESS global survey data was used in this study and comprised 70 652 respondents after pre-processing. Binary classification is performed for predicting Stress and Coping with stress, while 2 ensemble machine learning algorithms, deep super learner and cascade deep forest, and state-of-the-art methods are explored for classification. Correlation attribute evaluation is used for feature significance. Statistical analysis, such as Cronbach's alpha, demographic statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, independent sample t-test, and 95% CI, is also performed.\nGlobally, females, the younger population, and those in COVID-19 risk groups are observed to possess higher levels of stress. Trust, Loneliness, and Distress are found to be the primary predictors of Stress, whereas the significant predictors for coping with stress are identified as Social Provision, Extroversion, and Agreeableness. Deep super learner and cascade deep forest outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of up to 88.42%.\nBy comparing different classifiers, we can conclude that multi-layer ensemble outperforms all. Another aim of this study, is the ability to regulate demographic and negative psychological states with a goal of medical interventions and to work towards building multiple coping strategies to reduce stress and promote resilience and recovery from COVID-19.", "Walking speed is considered a reliable assessment tool for any movement-related functional activities of an individual (i.e., patients and healthy controls) by caregivers and clinicians. Traditional video surveillance gait monitoring in clinics and aged care homes may employ modern artificial intelligence techniques to utilize walking speed as a screening indicator of various physical outcomes or accidents in individuals. Specifically, ratio-based body measurements of walking individuals are extracted from marker-free and two-dimensional video images to create a walk pattern suitable for walking speed classification using deep learning based artificial intelligence techniques. However, the development of successful and highly predictive deep learning architecture depends on the optimal use of extracted data because redundant data may overburden the deep learning architecture and hinder the classification performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the optimal combination of ratio-based body measurements needed for presenting potential information to define and predict a walk pattern in terms of speed with high classification accuracy using a deep learning-based walking speed classification model. To this end, the performance of different combinations of five ratio-based body measurements was evaluated through a correlation analysis and a deep learning-based walking speed classification test. The results show that a combination of three ratio-based body measurements can potentially define and predict a walk pattern in terms of speed with classification accuracies greater than 92% using a bidirectional long short-term memory deep learning method.", "We present a systematic literature review of dialogue agents for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and agent-based conversational systems dealing with cognitive disability of aged and impaired people including dementia and Parkinson's disease.

However, identifying patients who are complete responders is often a challenge. This review aims to present and discuss current evidence and recommendations regarding the assessment of treatment response in rectal cancer.\nA review of the current literature on rectal cancer restaging was performed. Studies included in this review explored the optimal interval between the end of neoadjuvant therapy and restaging, as well as modalities of assessment and their diagnostic performance.\nThe current standard for restaging rectal cancer is a multimodal assessment with the digital rectal examination, endoscopy, and T2-weighted MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging. Other diagnostic procedures under investigation are PET/MRI, radiomics, confocal laser endomicroscopy, artificial intelligence-assisted endoscopy, cell-free DNA, and prediction models incorporating one or more of the above-mentioned exams.\nNon-operative management of rectal cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach. Understanding of the robustness and limitations of each exam is critical to inform patient selection for that treatment strategy.", "Predicting Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in Total- UPDRS and Motor-UPDRS clinical scales is an important part of controlling PD. Computational intelligence approaches have been used effectively in the early diagnosis of PD by predicting UPDRS. In this research, we target to present a combined approach for PD diagnosis using an ensemble learning approach with the ability of online learning from clinical large datasets. The method is developed using Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Neuro-Fuzzy approaches. A clustering approach, Expectation-Maximization (EM), is used to handle large datasets. The Principle Component Analysis (PCA) technique is employed for noise removal from the data. The UPDRS prediction models are constructed for PD diagnosis. To handle the missing data, K-NN is used in the proposed method. We use incremental machine learning approaches to improve the efficiency of the proposed method. We assess our approach on a real-world PD dataset and the findings are assessed compared to other PD diagnosis approaches developed by machine learning techniques. The findings revealed that the approach can improve the UPDRS prediction accuracy and the time complexity of previous methods in handling large datasets.", "Recently, using artificial intelligence (AI) in drug discovery has received much attention since it significantly shortens the time and cost of developing new drugs. Deep learning (DL)-based approaches are increasingly being used in all stages of drug development as DL technology advances, and drug-related data grows. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic Literature review (SLR) that integrates the recent DL technologies and applications in drug discovery Including, drug-target interactions (DTIs), drug-drug similarity interactions (DDIs), drug sensitivity and responsiveness, and drug-side effect predictions. We present a review of more than 300 articles between 2000 and 2022. The benchmark data sets, the databases, and the evaluation measures are also presented. In addition, this paper provides an overview of how explainable AI (XAI) supports drug discovery problems. The drug dosing optimization and success stories are discussed as well. Finally, digital twining (DT) and open issues are suggested as future research challenges for drug discovery problems. Challenges to be addressed, future research directions are identified, and an extensive bibliography is also included.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects nearly 1 in 44 children younger than 8 years old in the United States, and the situation may be even worse in remote areas of the world. However, it is difficult to utilize existing approaches to screen patients with ASD in remote areas due to the lack of professionals and high-tech instruments. Therefore, we develop a fast and accurate scalable method for screening children with ASD.\nA deep weakly supervised artificial intelligence model is proposed for ASD screening based on the dynamic viewing patterns (DVP) over viewing time and visual stimuli. In training, we utilized a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn the mapping between the autoencoder-based encoded dynamic patterns and the labels. In testing, we fed the encoded DVP of each undiagnosed child into the trained network and predicted the diagnosis category based on the score on all stimuli.\nBased on the multi-center evaluation on 165 subjects (95 typically developing children and 70 children with ASD) aged 3-6 years from different areas of China, our method achieves an average recognition accuracy of 96.73% (sensitivity 96.85% and specificity 96.63%).\nThe DVP is a discriminating attribute to identify the atypical performance of ASD. The DVP-based model is an effective platform for enhancing auxiliary ASD screening accuracy.\nWe validated the importance of dynamic information on between-group differences and classification. Additionally, the evaluation results suggest that the proposed model can provide an objective and accessible tool for scalable ASD screening applications.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the entire globe since its first appearance at the end of 2019. Although vaccines are now in production, the number of contaminations remains high, thus increasing the number of specialized personnel that can analyze clinical exams and points out the final diagnosis. Computed tomography and X-ray images are the primary sources for computer-aided COVID-19 diagnosis, but we still lack better interpretability of such automated decision-making mechanisms. This manuscript presents an insightful comparison of three approaches based on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to light up interpretability in the context of COVID-19 diagnosis using deep networks: Composite Layer-wise Propagation, Single Taylor Decomposition, and Deep Taylor Decomposition. Two deep networks have been used as the backbones to assess the explanation skills of the XAI approaches mentioned above: VGG11 and VGG16. We hope that such work can be used as a basis for further research on XAI and COVID-19 diagnosis for each approach figures its own positive and negative points.", "In Germany, long-term video EEG as the gold standard for the diagnostics of epilepsy and other seizure disorders, is currently only available for inpatient monitoring in a\u00a0limited number of specialized centers. These limited monitoring capacities and the large amount of associated time and work resources lead to a\u00a0significant waiting time for this important diagnostic procedure nationwide. New portable sensor technology and automated data analysis methods are creating opportunities for gold standard long-term video EEG assessments in outpatient settings, which may help to resolve this barrier. Here, we report the results of a\u00a0single-center feasibility study by implementing outpatient long-term video EEG (ALVEEG) as a\u00a0diagnostic pathway in Germany. In the new diagnostic pathway, the use of innovative, portable video EEG monitoring systems along with artificial intelligence-assisted data analysis are intended to provide those patients affected by seizure disorders with a\u00a0more rapid, efficient, and cross-sectoral access to gold standard diagnostics in the home environment. The diagnostics were well accepted by patients and clinicians and may represent a\u00a0complementary option to inpatient monitoring to eliminate current bottlenecks in diagnostics and care.\nDas Langzeit-Video-EEG als Goldstandarddiagnostik bei Epilepsie und anderen Anfallsleiden ist in Deutschland derzeit nur in wenigen spezialisierten Zentren zur station\u00e4ren \u00dcberwachung verf\u00fcgbar. Diese begrenzten \u00dcberwachungskapazit\u00e4ten und der damit verbundene hohe Zeit- und Arbeitsaufwand f\u00fchren bundesweit zu einer erheblichen Wartezeit f\u00fcr diese wichtige Diagnostik. Neue, tragbare Sensortechnologien und automatisierte Datenanalysemethoden schaffen M\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr Video-EEG-Langzeituntersuchungen nach dem Goldstandard im ambulanten Bereich, die dazu beitragen k\u00f6nnen, diese Barriere zu \u00fcberwinden. Hier berichten wir \u00fcber die Ergebnisse einer Machbarkeitsstudie an einem Zentrum, in der das ambulante Langzeit-Video-EEG (ALVEEG) als diagnostischer Weg in Deutschland eingef\u00fchrt wurde.

Efficient metal recovery from PCBs is highly dependent on the determination of the optimum combination of inputs in the recycling process. In this study, optimization and predictive modelling of the bio-Fenton process were performed employing the response surface methodology (RSM) and the artificial intelligence (AI) models for efficient enzymatic metal bioleaching from discarded cellphone PCBs. The Box-Behnken design (BBD) of RSM was chosen as the design matrix. Further, two AI models, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to predict complex metal bioleaching process. Experiments were performed based on variations of four input process parameters, namely, glucose oxidase (GOx) content (100-1000 U/L), Fe2+ content (10-50\u00a0mM), PCB pulp density (1-10\u00a0g/L), and shaking speed (150-450\u00a0rpm). Results revealed that the maximum simultaneous enzymatic metal extraction of 100% Cu, 70% Ni, 40% Pb, and 100% Zn was attained at the optimized conditions: GOx content: 300 U/L, Fe2+ content: 10\u00a0mM, pulp density: 1\u00a0g/L, and shaking speed: 335\u00a0rpm. A comparative analysis of the AI models suggested that the ANN-based model predicting more accurate results than the SVM-based model with coefficient of determination values\u00a0>\u00a00.99 for all the targeted metals. The FTIR analysis confirmed the partial disintegration of PCB polymeric base by OH radicals (OH\u2022), which helped in liberating and exposing the embedded metals to the bio-Fenton solution. Further, the oxidation of metals by ferric ions produced from GOx-mediated oxidation of ferrous ions ensued efficient enzymatic metal bioleaching. Selective metal recovery of >99% was obtained by the chemical precipitation of bioleachate.", "Organizations today require employees who are well at managing emotional intelligence and using their emotions in a constructive process. The present study considered the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS) for the study. WLEIS has four factors: self-emotional appraisal (SEA), other's emotional appraisal (OEA), regulation of emotion (ROE), and use of emotions (UOE). These scales help to manage emotions that result in satisfaction with life.\nThe purpose of the study is to validate WLEIS and SWLS because this scale has been validated across many countries but very few studies have been conducted in the Indian context. Apart from that, the current study also incorporated SWLS to validate constructs and measurement models.\nA sample of 238 participants working in the hospitality industry have been considered for the study. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to validate all the constructs and measurement models.\nThe three factors of WLEIS and SWLS showed Cronbach's \u03b1 more than 0.8 that showed excellent internal consistency except for SEA. The results of exploratory factor analysis found that eigenvalue ranged from 2.8 to 5.9, and the total variance explained by constructs was 65.9%. Confirmatory factor analysis showed average variance explained of each construct to be 0.5, and composite reliability to be more than 0.7, which shows excellent construct validity of scales in the Indian hospitality sector. The study also validates measurement research model of WLEIS and SWLS on the basis of model fit index (chi-square/df = 4.83, RMSEA = 0.10, GFI = 0.94, and CFI = 0.90).\nThe strong validity and reliability of the WLEIS and SWLS have proved that neuroscience can apply these scales to measure emotional intelligence in order to understand others' emotions and apply emotions in a constructive process that may lead to satisfaction with life.", "Sleep problems in children have been increasingly recognized as a major public health issue. Previous research has extensively studied and presented many risk factors and potential mechanisms for children's sleep problems. In this paper, we aimed to identify and summarize the consequences and implications of child sleep\u00a0problems.\nA comprehensive search for relevant English language full-text, peer-reviewed publications was performed focusing on pediatric sleep studies from prenatal to childhood and adolescence in a variety of indexes in PubMed, SCOPUS, and Psych Info published in the past two decades. Both relevant data-based articles\u00a0and systematic reviews are included.\nMany adverse consequences are associated with child sleep deficiency and other sleep problems, including physical outcomes (e.g.,\u00a0obesity), neurocognitive outcomes (e.g.,\u00a0memory and attention, intelligence, academic performance), and emotional and behavioral outcomes (e.g.,\u00a0internalizing/externalizing behaviors, behavioral disorders). Current prevention and intervention approaches to address childhood sleep problems include nutrition, exercise, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, aromatherapy, acupressure, and mindfulness. These interventions may be particularly important in the context of coronavirus disease 2019. Specific research and policy strategies can target the risk factors of child sleep as well as the efficacy and accessibility of treatments.\nGiven the increasing prevalence of child sleep problems, which have been shown to affect children's physical and neurobehavioral wellbeing, understanding the multi-aspect consequences and intervention programs for childhood sleep is important to inform future research direction as well as a public health practice for sleep screening and intervention, thus improving sleep-related child development and health.", "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the overall global burden of mental disorders. An increasing number of studies have revealed that among 20 different amino acids, high proline consumption is a dietary factor with the strongest impact on depression in humans and animals, including insects. Recent studies acknowledged that gut microbiota play a key role in proline-related pathophysiology of depression. In addition, the multi-omics approach has alleged that a high level of metabolite proline is directly linked to depression severity, while variations in levels of circulating proline are dependent on microbiome composition. The gut-brain axis proline analysis is a gut microbiome model of studying depression, highlighting the critical importance of diet, but nothing is known about the role of the plant microbiome-food axis in determining proline concentration in the diet and thus about preventing excessive proline intake through food consumption. In this paper, we discuss the protocooperative potential of a holistic study approach combining the microbiota-gut-brain axis with the microbiota-plant-food-diet axis, as both are involved in proline biogenesis and metabolism and thus on in its effect on mood and cognitive function. In preharvest agriculture, the main scientific focus must be directed towards plant symbiotic endophytes, as scavengers of abiotic stresses in plants and modulators of high proline concentration in crops/legumes/vegetables under climate change. It is also implied that postharvest agriculture-including industrial food processing-may be critical in designing a proline-balanced diet, especially if corroborated with microbiome-based preharvest agriculture, within a circular agrifood system. The microbiome is suggested as a target for selecting beneficial plant endophytes in aiming for a balanced dietary proline content, as it is involved in the physiology and energy metabolism of eukaryotic plant/human/animal/insect hosts, i.e., in core aspects of this amino acid network, while opening new venues for an efficient treatment of depression that can be adapted to vast groups of consumers and patients. In that regard, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and molecular biomarkers combined with rapid and non-destructive imaging technologies were also discussed in the scope of enhancing integrative science outcomes, agricultural efficiencies, and diagnostic medical precisions.", "Biological systems can exhibit intelligent swarm behavior through relatively independent individual, local interaction and decentralized decision-making. A major research challenge of self-organized swarm intelligence is the coupling influences between individual behaviors. Existing methods optimize the behavior of multiple individuals simultaneously from a global perspective. However, these methods lack in-depth inspiration from swarm behaviors in nature, so they are short of flexibly adapting to real multi-robot online decision-making tasks. To overcome such limits, this paper proposes a self-organized collision avoidance model for real drones incorporating a bio-inspired reward-modulated spiking neural network (RSNN). The local interaction and autonomous learning of a single individual leads to the emergence of swarm intelligence. We validated the proposed model on swarm collision avoidance tasks (a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles without central control) in a bounded space, carrying out simulation and real-world experiments. Compared with artificial neural network-based online learning methods, our proposed method exhibits superior performance and better stability.", "The objective of this study was to develop a numeric tool to automate the analysis of deformity from lower limb telemetry and assess its accuracy. Our hypothesis was that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm would be able to determine mechanical and anatomical angles to within 1\u00b0.\nAfter institutional review board approval, 1175 anonymized patient telemetries were extracted from a database of more than ten thousand telemetries. From this selection, 31 packs of telemetries were composed and sent to 11 orthopaedic surgeons for analysis. Each surgeon had to identify on the telemetries fourteen landmarks allowing determination of the following four angles: hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), and joint line convergence angle (JLCA). An algorithm based on a machine learning process was trained on our database to automatically determine angles. The reliability of the algorithm was evaluated by calculating the difference of determination precision between the surgeons and the algorithm.\nThe analysis time for obtaining 28 points and 8 angles per image was 48\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u00a0s for the algorithm. The average difference between the angles measured by the surgeons and the algorithm was around 1.9\u00b0 for all the angles of interest: 1.3\u00b0 for HKA, 1.6\u00b0 for MPTA, 2.1\u00b0 for LDFA, and 2.4\u00b0 for JLCA. Intraclass correlation was greater than 95% for all angles.\nThe algorithm showed high accuracy for automated angle measurement, allowing the estimation of limb frontal alignment to the nearest degree.", "The functioning of the brain has been a complex and enigmatic phenomenon. From the first approaches made by Descartes about this organism as the vehicle of the mind to contemporary studies that consider the brain as an organism with emergent activities of primary and higher order, this organism has been the object of continuous exploration. It has been possible to develop a more profound study of brain functions through imaging techniques, the implementation of digital platforms or simulators through different programming languages and the use of multiple processors to emulate the speed at which synaptic processes are executed in the brain. The use of various computational architectures raises innumerable questions about the possible scope of disciplines such as computational neurosciences in the study of the brain and the possibility of deep knowledge into different devices with the support that information technology (IT) brings. One of the main interests of cognitive science is the opportunity to develop human intelligence in a system or mechanism. This paper takes the principal articles of three databases oriented to computational sciences (EbscoHost Web, IEEE Xplore and Compendex Engineering Village) to understand the current objectives of neural networks in studying the brain. The possible use of this kind of technology is to develop artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can replicate more complex human brain tasks (such as those involving consciousness). The results show the principal findings in research and topics in developing studies about neural networks in computational neurosciences. One of the principal developments is the use of neural networks as the basis of much computational architecture using multiple techniques such as computational neuromorphic chips, MRI images and brain-computer interfaces (BCI) to enhance the capacity to simulate brain activities. This article aims to review and analyze those studies carried out on the development of different computational architectures that focus on affecting various brain activities through neural networks. The aim is to determine the orientation and the main lines of research on this topic and work in routes that allow interdisciplinary collaboration.", "Action recognition is an exciting research avenue for artificial intelligence since it may be a game changer in emerging industrial fields such as robotic visions and automobiles. However, current deep learning (DL) faces major challenges for such applications because of the huge computational cost and inefficient learning. Hence, we developed a novel brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) based system titled spiking gating flow (SGF) for online action learning. The developed system consists of multiple SGF units which are assembled in a hierarchical manner. A single SGF unit contains three layers: a feature extraction layer, an event-driven layer, and a histogram-based training layer. To demonstrate the capability of the developed system, we employed a standard dynamic vision sensor (DVS) gesture classification as a benchmark. The results indicated that we can achieve 87.5% of accuracy which is comparable with DL, but at a smaller training/inference data number ratio of 1.5:1. Only a single training epoch is required during the learning process. Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest accuracy among the non-backpropagation based SNNs. Finally, we conclude the few-shot learning (FSL) paradigm of the developed network: 1) a hierarchical structure-based network design involves prior human knowledge; 2) SNNs for content-based global dynamic feature detection.", "The research on a brain-like model with bio-interpretability is conductive to promoting its information processing ability in the field of artificial intelligence. Biological results show that the synaptic time-delay can improve the information processing abilities of the nervous system, which are an important factor related to the formation of brain cognitive functions. However, the synaptic plasticity with time-delay of a brain-like model still lacks bio-interpretability. In this study, combining excitatory and inhibitory synapses, we construct the complex spiking neural networks (CSNNs) with synaptic time-delay that more conforms biological characteristics, in which the topology has scale-free property and small-world property, and the nodes are represented by an Izhikevich neuron model. Then, the information processing abilities of CSNNs with different types of synaptic time-delay are comparatively evaluated based on the anti-interference function, and the mechanism of this function is discussed. Using two indicators of the anti-interference function and three kinds of noise, our simulation results consistently verify that: (i) From the perspective of anti-interference function, an CSNN with synaptic random time-delay outperforms an CSNN with synaptic fixed time-delay, which in turn outperforms an CSNN with synaptic none time-delay. The results imply that brain-like networks with more bio-interpretable synaptic time-delay have stronger information processing abilities. (ii) The synaptic plasticity is the intrinsic factor of the anti-interference function of CSNNs with different types of synaptic time-delay. (iii) The synaptic random time-delay makes an CSNN present better topological characteristics, which can improve the information processing ability of a brain-like network. It implies that synaptic time-delay is a factor that affects the anti-interference function at the level of performance.", "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent and one of the leading causes of disability in the US and around the world. There are some molecular biomarkers of heavy alcohol use and liver damage which can suggest AUD, but these are lacking in sensitivity and specificity. AUD treatment involves psychosocial interventions and medications for managing alcohol withdrawal, assisting in abstinence and reduced drinking (naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram, and some off-label medications), and treating comorbid psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression and anxiety). It has been suggested that various patient groups within the heterogeneous AUD population would respond more favorably to specific treatment approaches. For example, there is some evidence that so-called reward-drinkers respond better to naltrexone than acamprosate. However, there are currently no objective molecular markers to separate patients into optimal treatment groups or any markers of treatment response. Objective molecular biomarkers could aid in AUD diagnosis and patient stratification, which could personalize treatment and improve outcomes through more targeted interventions. Biomarkers of treatment response could also improve AUD management and treatment development. Systems biology considers complex diseases and emergent behaviors as the outcome of interactions and crosstalk between biomolecular networks. A systems approach that uses transcriptomic (or other -omic data, e.g., methylome, proteome, metabolome) can capture genetic and environmental factors associated with AUD and potentially provide sensitive, specific, and objective biomarkers to guide patient stratification, prognosis of treatment response or relapse, and predict optimal treatments. This Review describes and highlights state-of-the-art research on employing transcriptomic data and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to serve as molecular biomarkers with the goal of improving the clinical management of AUD. Considerations about future directions are also discussed.", "Cognitive reserve (CR), the brain's ability to cope with brain pathology to minimize symptoms, could explain the heterogeneity of outcomes in neuropsychiatric disorders, however it is still rarely investigated in schizophrenia. Indeed, this study aims to classify CR in this disorder and evaluate its impact on neurocognitive and socio-cognitive performance and daily functioning. A group of 106 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia was enrolled and assessed in these aereas: neurocognition, Theory of Mind (ToM) and daily functioning. A composite CR score was determined through an integration of the intelligence quotient and education and leisure activities. CR profiles were classified with a two-step cluster analysis and differences among clusters were determined with an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The cluster analysis was identified with three CR profiles characterized, respectively, by high, medium and low CR. ANOVA analysis showed significant differences on neurocognition, ToM and daily functioning between the clusters: people with higher CR reached significantly superior scores. This study suggests that greater general cognitive resources could act as a buffer against the effect of brain pathology, allowing patients to have a better cognitive performance, social outcome and quality of life.", "The introduction of digital information and communication technologies has influenced many aspects of the teaching profession. In addition to their changing use in the classroom, these technologies have strongly impacted the work and professional development of teachers. In this study, which was framed within the R+D+i project DePrInEd, we analyzed the perceptions, beliefs, opinions, and attitudes of teachers on this subject. We conducted a qualitative study through interviews, with a thematic analysis addressing the duality of technology and change. The results indicated that these produced benefits and created difficulties in the teaching task, with the latter being more demanding. Teachers stated that one of the main difficulties they encountered was related to the evolution of students as a result of technology, both in the school and social contexts. This highlights the risk that its extensive use did not lead to the acquisition of other key competencies, including digital and media competencies, in the school environment. Finally, other dimensions that impacted the corporate intelligence of educational centers included the continuous adaptation and mastery of digital competence required by teachers regarding the changes in their tasks, as well as the excessive bureaucratization that technologies have necessitated.", "In the big data era, vast volumes of data are generated daily as the foundation of data-driven scientific discovery. Thanks to the recent open data movement, much of these data are being made available to the public, significantly advancing scientific research and accelerating socio-technical development. However, not all data are suitable for opening or sharing because of concerns over privacy, ownership, trust, and incentive. Therefore, data sharing remains a challenge for specific data types and holders, making a bottleneck for further unleashing the potential of these \"closed data.\" To address this challenge, in this perspective, we conceptualize the current practices and technologies in data collaboration in a data-sharing-free manner and propose a concept of the model-sharing strategy for using closed data without sharing them. Supported by emerging advances in artificial intelligence, this strategy will unleash the large potential in closed data. Moreover, we show the advantages of the model-sharing strategy and explain how it will lead to a new paradigm of big data governance and collaboration.", "Emotional intelligence is a second-stratum factor of general intelligence (MacCann et al. 2014) that: (a) has been popularly touted as an essential individual difference for effective leadership (Goleman 1998), but also (b) exhibits large gender group differences favoring women (Joseph and Newman 2010). Combining these insights, we propose that emotional intelligence is a key mechanism in the so-called female leadership advantage (Eagly and Carli 2003-which emphasizes the finding that women are rated slightly higher in transformational leadership compared to men). The current study seeks to explain this gender leadership gap by specifying three personality-based theoretical mechanisms that enhance transformational leadership: (a) emotional intelligence (favoring women), (b) communion (stereotypical femininity; favoring women; Hsu et al. 2021), as well as an offsetting effect of (c) agency (stereotypical masculinity; favoring men). Meta-analytic data (including original meta-analyses among the leader's ability-based emotional intelligence, transformational leadership, communion, and agency) are used to test our theorized model. Results confirm the full mediation model of female leadership advantage. Because the three unique mechanisms operate in different directions, their individual indirect effects are notable, but their cumulative indirect effect is small and near-zero. In conclusion, we emphasize incorporating emotional intelligence with other personality-based explanations of gender effects in leadership perceptions.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve public health's ability to promote the health of all people in all communities. To successfully realize this potential and use AI for public health functions it is important for public health organizations to thoughtfully develop strategies for AI implementation. Six key priorities for successful use of AI technologies by public health organizations are discussed: 1) Contemporary data governance; 2) Investment in modernized data and analytic infrastructure and procedures; 3) Addressing the skills gap in the workforce; 4) Development of strategic collaborative partnerships; 5) Use of good AI practices for transparency and reproducibility, and; 6) Explicit consideration of equity and bias.", "The introduction of the first whole-body CT scanner in 1974 marked the beginning of cross-sectional spine imaging. In the last decades, the technological advancement, increasing availability and clinical success of CT led to a\u00a0rapidly growing number of CT examinations, also of the spine. After initially being primarily used for trauma evaluation, new indications continued to emerge, such as assessment of vertebral fractures or degenerative spine disease, preoperative and postoperative evaluation, or CT-guided interventions at the spine; however, improvements in patient management and clinical outcomes come along with higher radiation exposure, which increases the risk for secondary malignancies. Therefore, technical developments in CT acquisition and reconstruction must always include efforts to reduce the radiation dose. But how exactly can the dose be reduced? What amount of dose reduction can be achieved without compromising the clinical value of spinal CT examinations and what can be expected from the rising stars in CT technology: artificial intelligence and photon counting CT? In this article, we try to answer these questions by systematically reviewing dose reduction techniques with respect to the major clinical indications of spinal CT. Furthermore, we take a\u00a0concise look on the dose reduction potential of future developments in CT hardware and software.", "We present a unified computational theory of an agent's perception and memory. In our model, both perception and memory are realized by different operational modes of the oscillating interactions between a symbolic index layer and a subsymbolic representation layer. The two layers form a bilayer tensor network (BTN). The index layer encodes indices for concepts, predicates, and episodic instances. The representation layer broadcasts information and reflects the cognitive brain state; it is our model of what authors have called the \"mental canvas\" or the \"global workspace.\" As a bridge between perceptual input and the index layer, the representation layer enables the grounding of indices by their subsymbolic embeddings, which are implemented as connection weights linking both layers. The propagation of activation to earlier perceptual processing layers in the brain can lead to embodiments of indices. Perception and memories first create subsymbolic representations, which are subsequently decoded semantically to produce sequences of activated indices that form symbolic triple statements. The brain is a sampling engine: only activated indices are communicated to the remaining parts of the brain. Triple statements are dynamically embedded in the representation layer and embodied in earlier processing layers: the brain speaks to itself. Although memory appears to be about the past, its main purpose is to support the agent in the present and the future. Recent episodic memory provides the agent with a sense of the here and now. Remote episodic memory retrieves relevant past experiences to provide information about possible future scenarios. This aids the agent in decision making. \"Future\" episodic memory, based on expected future events, guides planning and action. Semantic memory retrieves specific information, which is not delivered by current perception, and defines priors for future observations. We argue that it is important for the agent to encode individual entities, not just classes and attributes. Perception is learning: episodic memories are constantly being formed, and we demonstrate that a form of self-supervised learning can acquire new concepts and refine existing ones. We test our model on a standard benchmark data set, which we expanded to contain richer representations for attributes, classes, and individuals. Our key hypothesis is that obtaining a better understanding of perception and memory is a crucial prerequisite to comprehending human-level intelligence.", "Recent developments of heterogeneous advanced oxidation for refractory organic contaminants and catalysts made of solid waste have attracted much attention. In this work, waste printed circuit board (wPCB) was used for catalytic degradation of simulated textile wastewater enhanced by ultrasound. Catalytic degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) was conducted in the presence of H2O2. Effect of ultrasound, wPCB, H2O2, pH, and dye concentration was investigated by single factor experiments. The growing catalytic efficiency was determined by ultrasound. The removal efficiency of MB and RhB are influenced by wPCB, H2O2, pH, and dye concentration. Degradation efficiency is accelerated with increasing wPCB dosage and H2O2 and decreasing dye concentration. Effective degradation of MB and RhB is obtained under broader pH region, attractively at neutral pH. Under optimal conditions, MB removal reaches 98.83% at 90\u00a0min while RhB removal reaches 99.57% at 80\u00a0min. Hydroxyl radicals play an important role in catalytic process. Tentative mechanism for catalytic degradation of MB and RhB are discussed based on multiple characterizations. Superior reusability of wPCB proves that wPCB is highly durable catalyst. Due to low cost and high efficiency, wPCB is attractive as effective catalyst for treatment of organic wastewater. Artificial neuron network-based (ANN) simulation, as a widely used artificial intelligence algorithm, was one of preferred methods for the wastewater treatment due to its unique properties in solving complex processes. An ANN model was designed for the prediction of the performance of ultrasound-enhanced catalytic degradation with a high R value (0.99).", "In this article we investigate origins of several cases of failure of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems employing machine learning and deep learning. We focus on omission and commission errors in (a) the inputs to the AI system, (b) the processing logic, and (c) the outputs from the AI system. Our framework yields a set of 28 factors that can be used for reconstructing the path of AI failures and for determining corrective action. Our research helps identify emerging themes of inquiry necessary for developing more robust AI-ML systems. We are hopeful that our work will help strengthen the use of machine-learning AI by enhancing the rates of true positive and true negative judgements from AI systems, and by lowering the probabilities of false positive and false negative judgements.", "To assess the 5-year neurocognitive outcomes of children born extremely preterm exposed to prophylactic hydrocortisone to improve survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\nThis was a prespecified secondary analysis of the PREMILOC clinical trial (trial registration: EudraCT no. 2007-002041-20, NCT00623740). The primary outcome was full-scale IQ based on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence.\nAmong 109 surviving children recruited at the Robert Debr\u00e9 Children's Hospital, Paris, outcome data were available for 42 out of 56 infants (75%) in the group treated with hydrocortisone and 41 out of 53 (77%) in the placebo group. Mean scores were not significantly different between the two groups on full-scale IQ (hydrocortisone: 91.9 [SD\u00a0=\u00a013.9], placebo: 86.3 [SD\u00a0=\u00a015.4]; mean difference\u00a0=\u00a05.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a0-1.0 to 12.3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.10); however, working memory and retention ability were significantly better in the group treated with hydrocortisone. In a multivariate logistic regression including potential confounding variables, hydrocortisone treatment was significantly associated with a greater chance to survive at 5\u2009years of age with a full-scale IQ\u2009equal to or greater than\u200990 compared to placebo (adjusted odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a04.26, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.47-12.36, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008).\nThis exploratory analysis provides reassuring data regarding the long-term neurodevelopmental safety of prophylactic hydrocortisone in infants born extremely preterm.", "Our purpose was to explore the relationship between cognitive impairment and neural network changes in patients newly diagnosed with self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS).\nThe Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, fourth edition was used to divide all SeLECTS patients into two groups: patients with full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) below 80 that corresponded to cognitive impairment, and patients with FSIQ above 80 that corresponded to a normal cognitive function. The data on the resting state were recorded using magnetoencephalography. The properties of the networks were analyzed using graph theory (GT) analysis.\nThe functional connectivity (FC) of the frontal cortex in patients with FSIQ\u00a0<\u00a080 was reduced in the 12-30\u00a0Hz frequency band, and the FC of the posterior cingulate cortex was reduced in the 80-250 and 250-500\u00a0Hz frequency bands. The GT analysis showed that patients in the FSIQ\u00a0<\u00a080 group had higher strength in the 8-12 and 12-30\u00a0Hz frequency bands than those in the healthy control and FSIQ\u00a0>\u00a080 group. However, the path length was reduced in the 80-250\u00a0Hz band, and the clustering coefficient was reduced in the 12-30, 80-250, and 250-500\u00a0Hz frequency bands. Moreover, the receiver operator characteristic analysis showed that the clustering coefficient in the 12-30 and 80-250\u00a0Hz frequency bands, as well as the path length in the 80-250\u00a0Hz frequency band possessed a good discriminative ability in distinguishing the FSIQ\u00a0>\u00a080 group.\nSeLECTS patients with cognitive impairment in the early stage of the disease developed disordered networks in cognitive-related brain regions. The clustering coefficient in the 12-30 and 80-250\u00a0Hz frequency bands as well as the path length in the 80-250\u00a0Hz frequency band might be good indicators to distinguish the cognitive impairment of SeLECTS patients at the early stage.", "This study assesses the knowledge and attitudes of medical students in Lebanon toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical education. It also explores the students' perspectives regarding the role of AI in medical education as a subject in the curriculum and a teaching tool.\nThis is a cross-sectional study using an online survey consisting of close-ended questions. The survey targets medical students at all medical levels across the 7 medical schools in Lebanon.\nA total of 206 medical students responded. When assessing AI knowledge sources (81.1%) got their information from the media as compared to (9.7%) from medical school curriculum. However, Students who learned the basics of AI as part of the medical school curriculum were more knowledge about AI than their peers who did not. Students in their clinical years appear to be more knowledgeable about AI in medicine. The advancements in AI affected the choice of specialty of around a quarter of the students (26.8%). Finally, only a quarter of students (26.5%) want to be assessed by AI, even though the majority (57.7%) reported that assessment by AI is more objective.\nEducation about AI should be incorporated in the medical school curriculum to improve the knowledge and attitudes of medical students. Improving AI knowledge in medical students will in turn increase acceptance of AI as a tool in medical education, thus unlocking its potential in revolutionizing medical education.", "Neonatal nurses play an important role in the development of effective partnerships, as they have more consistent interactions with the patients' parents and can encourage parental involvement. This study aimed to identify factors influencing neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses' development of partnerships with parents of high-risk infants in South Korea based on King's interacting systems theory.\nWe collected data utilizing a structured questionnaire, which included the following variables: developmental supportive nursing competency, empowerment, emotional intelligence, patient-centered communication skills, interpersonal competence, nursing work environment, and nurse-parent partnership. The participants were 140 pediatric nurses with at least one year of NICU experience in South Korea. We used SPSS/WIN 26.0 to analyze the data.\nOf the factors evaluated, empowerment (\u03b2 = 0.35, p < 0.001), patient-centered communication skills (\u03b2 = 0.25, p < 0.01), interpersonal competence (\u03b2 = -0.27, p = 0.001), emotional intelligence (\u03b2 = 0.25, p = 0.005), age (\u03b2 = -0.15, p < 0.01), and gender (\u03b2 = 0.12, p = 0.03) explained 62.4% of the total variance of the nurse-parent partnership. Our results identify the factors affecting NICU nurses' development of partnerships with parents of high-risk infants.\nStrategies and efforts to enhance the nurse-parent relationship must consider improving nurse empowerment, intelligence, and interpersonal factors.", "Pathology services experienced a surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Digitalisation of pathology workflows can help to increase throughput, yet many existing digitalisation solutions use non-standardised workflows captured in proprietary data formats and processed by black-box software, yielding data of varying quality. This study presents the views of a UK-led expert group on the barriers to adoption and the required input of measurement science to improve current practices in digital pathology.\nWith an aim to support the UK's efforts in digitalisation of pathology services, this study comprised: (1) a review of existing evidence, (2) an online survey of domain experts, and (3) a workshop with 42 representatives from healthcare, regulatory bodies, pharmaceutical industry, academia, equipment, and software manufacturers. The discussion topics included sample processing, data interoperability, image analysis, equipment calibration, and use of novel imaging modalities.\nThe lack of data interoperability within the digital pathology workflows hinders data lookup and navigation, according to 80% of attendees. All participants stressed the importance of integrating imaging and non-imaging data for diagnosis, while 80% saw data integration as a priority challenge. 90% identified the benefits of artificial intelligence and machine learning, but identified the need for training and sound performance metrics.Methods for calibration and providing traceability were seen as essential to establish harmonised, reproducible sample processing, and image acquisition pipelines. Vendor-neutral data standards were seen as a \"must-have\" for providing meaningful data for downstream analysis. Users and vendors need good practice guidance on evaluation of uncertainty, fitness-for-purpose, and reproducibility of artificial intelligence/machine learning tools. All of the above needs to be accompanied by an upskilling of the pathology workforce.\nDigital pathology requires interoperable data formats, reproducible and comparable laboratory workflows, and trustworthy computer analysis software. Despite high interest in the use of novel imaging techniques and artificial intelligence tools, their adoption is slowed down by the lack of guidance and evaluation tools to assess the suitability of these techniques for specific clinical question. Measurement science expertise in uncertainty estimation, standardisation, reference materials, and calibration can help establishing reproducibility and comparability between laboratory procedures, yielding high quality data and providing higher confidence in diagnosis.", "In five different online studies of community samples, participants (N\u2009>\u20092,200) estimated their IQ and EQ on a single scale and completed three different, short, untimed intelligence tests. In all studies, women estimated their IQ significantly lower than men (effect sizes from 0.22-0.47) and estimated their EQ higher (effect size 0.04-0.32). In only one study were there actual sex differences in IQ test scores. All correlations between the two estimates were significant and positive, and ranged from .37 < r < .47. The robustness of the IQ-EQ hubris-humility effect across measures and populations is discussed. Limitations are acknowledged, particularly in the use of tests.", "Existing approaches neither provide an accurate prediction of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) nor offer a quantitative comparison among a group of its risk factors. To evaluate the population, hypertension, age, size, earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage, and location (PHASES) and unruptured intracranial aneurysm treatment score (UIATS) scores and develop an Artificial Intelligence-based 5-year and lifetime aneurysmal rupture criticality prediction (ARCP) score for a set of risk factors.\nWe design various location-specific and ensemble learning models to develop lifetime rupture risk, employ the longitudinal data to develop a linear regression-based model to predict an aneurysm's growth score, and use the Apriori algorithm to identify risk factors strongly associated with SAH. We develop ARCP by integrating output of Apriori algorithm and ML models and compare with PHASES and UIATS scores along with the scores of a multidisciplinary team of neurosurgeons.\nThe PHASES and UIATS scores show sensitivities of 22% and 35% and specificities of 76% and 79%, respectively. Location-specific models show precision and recall of 93% and 90% for the middle cerebral artery, 83% and 80% for the anterior communicating artery, and 80% and 80% for the supraclinoid internal carotid artery, respectively. The ensemble method shows both precision and recall of 80%. The validation of the models shows that ARCP performs better than our control group of neurosurgeons. Data-driven knowledge produces comparisons among 61 risk factor combinations, 11 ranked minor, 8 moderate, and 41 severe, and 1 of which is a critical factor.\nThe PHASES and UIATS are weak predictors, and the ARCP score can identify, and grade, risk factors associated with SAH.", "Radiologists today play a central role in making diagnostic decisions and labeling images for training and benchmarking artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. A key concern is low inter-reader reliability (IRR) seen between experts when interpreting challenging cases. While team-based decisions are known to outperform individual decisions, inter-personal biases often creep up in group interactions which limit nondominant participants from expressing true opinions. To overcome the dual problems of low consensus and interpersonal bias, we explored a solution modeled on bee swarms. Two separate cohorts, three board-certified radiologists, (cohort 1), and five radiology residents (cohort 2) collaborated on a digital swarm platform in real time and in a blinded fashion, grading meniscal lesions on knee MR exams. These consensus votes were benchmarked against clinical (arthroscopy) and radiological (senior-most radiologist) standards of reference using Cohen's kappa. The IRR of the consensus votes was then compared to the IRR of the majority and most confident votes of the two cohorts. IRR was also calculated for predictions from a meniscal lesion detecting AI algorithm. The attending cohort saw an improvement of 23% in IRR of swarm votes (k = 0.34) over majority vote (k = 0.11). Similar improvement of 23% in IRR (k = 0.25) in 3-resident swarm votes over majority vote (k = 0.02) was observed. The 5-resident swarm had an even higher improvement of 30% in IRR (k = 0.37) over majority vote (k = 0.07). The swarm consensus votes outperformed individual and majority vote decision in both the radiologists and resident cohorts. The attending and resident swarms also outperformed predictions from a state-of-the-art AI algorithm.", "Due the quick spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), identification of that disease, prediction of mortality rate and recovery rate are considered as one of the critical challenges in the whole world. The occurrence of COVID-19 dissemination beyond the world is analyzed in this research and an artificial-intelligence (AI) based deep learning algorithm is suggested to detect positive cases of COVID19 patients, mortality rate and recovery rate using real-world datasets. Initially, the unwanted data like prepositions, links, hashtags etc., are removed using some pre-processing techniques. After that, term frequency inverse-term frequency (TF-IDF) andBag of Words (BoW) techniques are utilized to extract the features from pre-processed dataset. Then, Mayfly Optimization (MO) algorithm is performed to pick the relevant features from the set of features. Finally, two deep learning procedures, ResNet model and GoogleNet model, are hybridized to achieve the prediction process. Our system examines two different kinds of publicly available text datasets to identify COVID-19 disease as well as to predict mortality rate and recovery rate using those datasets. There are four different datasets are taken to analyse the performance, in which the proposed method achieves 97.56% accuracy which is 1.40% greater than Linear Regression (LR) and Multinomial Naive Bayesian (MNB), 3.39% higher than Random Forest (RF) and Stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) as well as 5.32% higher than Decision tree (DT) and Bagging techniques if first dataset. When compared to existing machine learning models, the simulation result indicates that a proposed hybrid deep learning method is valuable in corona virus identification and future mortality forecast study.", "To study whether there is genetic overlap underlying the risk for schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) and low intelligence quotient (IQ), we reviewed and summarized the evidence on genetic variants associated with both traits.\nWe performed this review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and preregistered it in PROSPERO. We searched the Medline databases via PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science and Scopus. We included studies in adults with a diagnosis of SSD that explored genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], copy number variants [CNVs], genomic insertions or genomic deletions), estimated IQ and studied the relationship between genetic variability and both traits (SSD and IQ). We synthesized the results and assessed risk of bias using the Quality of Genetic Association Studies (Q-Genie) tool.\nFifty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (45 case-control, 9 cross-sectional, 1 cohort), of which 55% reported significant associations for genetic variants involved in IQ and SSD. The SNPs more frequently explored through candidate gene studies were in COMT, DTNBP1, BDNF and TCF4. Through genome-wide association studies, 2 SNPs in CHD7 and GATAD2A were associated with IQ in patients with SSD. The studies on CNVs suggested significant associations between structural variants and low IQ in patients with SSD.\nOverall, primary studies used heterogeneous IQ measurement tools and had small samples. Grey literature was not screened.\nGenetic overlap between SSD and IQ supports the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia. Most of the risk polymorphisms identified were in genes relevant to brain development, neural proliferation and differentiation, and synaptic plasticity.", "Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) allows the acquisition of the subjective perspective of patients regarding their health and function; yet a very few studies have been evaluated HRQoL of patients treated for craniosynostosis (CS). In this retrospective, descriptive cohort study, school-aged children (7-16\u2009years) treated for non-syndromic CS were assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scales. Seventy-three patients and their parents responded to the PedsQL (response rate: 80.2%). Patients generally estimated average HRQoL with no difference compared to the normal population sample. Further, no difference in HRQoL was found between treated sagittal (SS) or metopic synostosis. In the SS group, surgical methods involving spring-assisted surgery and pi-plasty were unrelated to HRQoL outcomes. Additionally, HRQoL was highly correlated with intelligence quotient (IQ, r\u2009=\u20090.42; p\u2009=\u20090.0004) and adaptive behavior skills (ABAS, r\u2009=\u20090.57; p\u2009=\u20090.0001). Furthermore, differences were observed in estimated physical function (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and school function (p\u2009=\u20090.012) between self- and proxy reports (i.e. parents estimated child HRQoL as higher than did the children). Children treated for CS have a generally average HRQoL, and neither CS type nor surgical method influenced HRQoL outcomes. Moreover, children and parents estimated HRQoL differently, suggesting the importance of using both self- and proxy reporting in patient-reported measures. HRQoL was strongly related to IQ and ABAS, indicating that the PedsQL can be used as a screening instrument to identify craniofacial patients in need of further psychological assessment.", "Conductive hydrogels have attracted extensive interest owing to its potential in soft robotics, electronic skin, and human monitoring. However, insufficient mechanical properties, lower adhesivity, and unsatisfactory conductivity seriously hinder potential applications in this emerging field. Herein, a highly elastic conductive hydrogel with a combination of favorable mechanical properties, self-adhesiveness, and excellent electrical performance was achieved by the synergistic effect of aminated lignin (AL), polydopamine (PDA), polyacrylamide (PAM) chains, and biomass carbon aerogel (C-SPF). In detail, AL was applied to induce slow oxidative polymerization of DA for preparing the sticky hydrogel containing PDA. Then, C-SPF carbon aerogel was used as a matrix to construct a dual-network structured composite hydrogel by combining with the hydrogels derived from PDA, AL, and PAM. The as-prepared conductive hydrogel displayed excellent mechanical performance, strong adhesive strength, and repeatable adhesivity. The prepared hydrogel-based pressure sensor possessed fast response (0.6 s loading and 0.8 s unloading stress time), high response (maximum RCR = 1.8 \u00d7 104), wide working pressure range (from 0 to 240.0 kPa), and excellent durability (stable 500 compression cycles with 30% deformation). In addition, the prepared sensor also displayed ultrahigh sensitivity (170 kPa-1), which was near 4 orders of magnitude higher than the conventional lignin-modified PAM hydrogels. The multiple interactions between hydrogel components and the mechanical properties of hydrogel were also verified by molecular dynamics investigation. Moreover, the excellent cytocompatibility and antibacterial activity of this composite hydrogel ensured high potential in various applications such as human/machine interaction, artificial intelligence, personal healthcare, and wearable devices.", "During endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), cytopathology with rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) can improve diagnostic yield and accuracy. However, ROSE is unavailable in most Asian and European institutions because of the shortage of cytopathologists. Therefore, developing computer-assisted diagnostic tools to replace manual ROSE is crucial. Herein, we reported the validation of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model (ROSE-AI model) to substitute manual ROSE during EUS-FNA.\nA total of 467 digitized images from Diff-Quik (D&F)-stained EUS-FNA slides were divided into training (3642 tiles from 367 images) and internal validation (916 tiles from 100 images) datasets. The ROSE-AI model was trained and validated using training and internal validation datasets, respectively. The specificity was emphasized while developing the model. Then, we evaluated the AI model on a 693-image external dataset. We assessed the performance of the AI model to detect cancer cells (CCs) regarding the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).\nThe ROSE-AI model achieved an accuracy of 83.4% in the internal validation dataset and 88.7% in the external test dataset. The sensitivity and PPV were 79.1% and 71.7% in internal validation dataset and 78.0% and 60.7% in external test dataset, respectively.\nWe provided a proof of concept that AI can be used to replace manual ROSE during EUS-FNA. The ROSE-AI model can address the shortage of cytopathologists and make ROSE available in more institutes.", "The growing health and economic burden of bone fractures, their intricate multiscale features and the existing knowledge gaps in the comprehension of micro-scale bone damage occurrence make fracture diagnosis a challenging issue. In this scenario, deep-learning and artificial intelligence embody the new frontier of healthcare system, by overcoming the subjectivity of clinicians in the analysis of medical images. However, the preliminary attempts in exploiting the power of machine learning algorithms such as neural networks are still limited to bone macro-scale, while there is an evident lack in their application to smaller scales, where damage starts nucleating. Currently, speculations at the micro-scale are only feasible with the aid of high-resolution imaging techniques, that are particularly time consuming in terms of output images analysis. In this context, this works aims at combining the visualization of the micro-crack propagation mechanism with the promising application of convolutional neural networks. The implemented artificial intelligence tool is based for the first time on a large number of human synchrotron images coming from healthy and osteoporotic femoral heads tested under micro-compression. The designed convolutional neural networks are able to automatically detect lacunae and micro-cracks at different compression levels with high accuracy levels; indeed, with the baseline setup, networks achieve more than 0.99 level of accuracy for both cracks and lacunae, and more than 0.87 of the meanIoU adopted as validation metric. This approach is particularly encouraging for the development of powerful recognition system to comprehend bone micro-damage initiation and propagation, paving the way to the application of machine learning studies to bone micromechanics. This could be additionally crucial for future patient specific micro-scale observations to be related to the clinical practice.", "Declarative fact knowledge is a key component of crystallized intelligence. It is typically measured with multiple-choice (MC) items. Other response formats, such as open-ended formats are less frequently used, although these formats might be superior for measuring crystallized intelligence. Whereas MC formats presumably only require recognizing the correct response to a question, open-ended formats supposedly require cognitive processes such as searching for, retrieving, and actively deciding on a response from long-term memory. If the methods of inquiry alter the cognitive processes involved, mean-changes between methods for assessing declarative knowledge should come along with changes in the covariance structure. We tested these assumptions in two online studies administering declarative knowledge items in different response formats (MC, open-ended, and open-ended with cues). Item difficulty clearly increases in the open-ended methods although effects in logistic regression models vary slightly across items. Importantly, latent variable analyses suggest that the method of inquiry does not affect what is measured with different response formats. These findings clearly endorse the position that crystallized intelligence does not change as a function of the response format.", "Dyslexia is a neurological disorder manifested as difficulty reading and writing. It can occur despite adequate instruction, intelligence, and intact sensory abilities. Different electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns have been demonstrated between dyslexic and healthy subjects in previous studies. This study focuses on the difference between patients before and after treatment. The main goal is to identify the subset of features that adequately discriminate subjects before and after a specific treatment plan. The treatment consists of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and occupational therapy using the BrainWare SAFARI software. The EEG signals of sixteen dyslexic children were recorded during the eyes-closed resting state before and after treatment. The preprocessing step was followed by the extraction of a wide range of features to investigate the differences related to the treatment. An optimal subset of features extracted from recorded EEG signals was determined using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in conjunction with the Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) algorithm. The results showed that treatment leads to significant changes in EEG features like spectral and phase-related EEG features, in various regions. It has been demonstrated that the extracted subset of discriminative features can be useful for classification applications in treatment assessment. The most discriminative subset of features could classify the data with an accuracy of 92% with SVM classifier. The above result confirms the efficacy of the treatment plans in improving dyslexic children's cognitive skills.", "Exon-skipping is a powerful genetic tool, especially when delivering genes using an AAV-mediated full-length gene supplementation strategy is difficult owing to large length of genes. Here, we used engineered human induced pluripotent stem cells and artificial intelligence to evaluate clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 9-based exon-skipping vectors targeting genes of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The model system was choroideremia; this is an X-linked inherited retinal disease caused by mutation of the CHM gene.\nWe explored whether artificial intelligence detected differentiation of human OTX2, PAX6 and MITF (hOPM) cells, in which OTX2, PAX6 and MITF expression was induced by doxycycline treatment, into RPE. Plasmid encoding CHM exon-skipping modules targeting the splice donor sites of exons 6 were constructed. A clonal hOPM cell line with a frameshift mutation in exon 6 was generated and differentiated into RPE. CHM exon 6-skipping was induced, and the effects of skipping on phagocytic activity, cell death and prenylation of Rab small GTPase (RAB) were evaluated using flow cytometry, an in vitro prenylation assay and western blotting.\nArtificial intelligence-based evaluation of RPE differentiation was successful. Retinal pigment epithelium cells with a frameshift mutation in exon 6 showed increased cell death, reduced phagocytic activity and increased cytosolic unprenylated RABs only when oxidative stress was in play. The latter two phenotypes were partially rescued by exon 6-skipping of CHM.\nCHM exon 6-skipping contributed to RPE phagocytosis probably by increasing RAB38 prenylation under oxidative stress.", "Despite much progress in training artificial intelligence (AI) systems to imitate human language, building agents that use language to communicate intentionally with humans in interactive environments remains a major challenge. We introduce Cicero, the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in Diplomacy, a strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation and tactical coordination between seven players. Cicero integrates a language model with planning and reinforcement learning algorithms by inferring players' beliefs and intentions from its conversations and generating dialogue in pursuit of its plans. Across 40 games of an anonymous online Diplomacy league, Cicero achieved more than double the average score of the human players and ranked in the top 10% of participants who played more than one game.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in the field of retina. The purpose of this study was to analyze the study trends within AI in retina by reporting on publication trends, to identify journals, countries, authors, international collaborations, and keywords involved in AI in retina.\nA cross-sectional study. Bibliometric methods were used to evaluate global production and development trends in AI in retina since 2012 using Web of Science Core Collection.\nA total of 599 publications were retrieved ultimately. We found that AI in retina is a very attractive topic in scientific and medical community. No journal was found to specialize in AI in retina. The USA, China, and India were the three most productive countries. Authors from Austria, Singapore, and England also had worldwide academic influence. China has shown the greatest rapid increase in publication numbers. International collaboration could increase influence in this field. Keywords revealed that diabetic retinopathy, optical coherence tomography on multiple diseases, algorithm were three popular topics in the field. Most of top journals and top publication on AI in retina were mainly focused on engineering and computing, rather than medicine.\nThese results helped clarify the current status and future trends in researches of AI in retina. This study may be useful for clinicians and scientists to have a general overview of this field, and better understand the main actors in this field (including authors, journals, and countries). Researches are supposed to focus on more retinal diseases, multiple modal imaging, and performance of AI models in real-world clinical application. Collaboration among countries and institutions is common in current research of AI in retina.", "To analyze and compare the emergence angle (EA) using two measurement methods, conventional and modified (EA-GPT and EA-R), the EAs of all-natural teeth were evaluated and classified to derive a suitable and predictable clinically applicable measurement method.\nNatural human teeth (n=600) were classified, cleaned, and thoroughly inspected. Teeth were scanned using an intraoral scanner. The scanned data were analyzed using three-dimensional analysis software for both methods with several points per surface. A Bland-Altman analysis was used for statistical analysis and a heat map and a nonparametric density plot to assess the repetition and distribution. An XGBoost regression model was used for prediction.\nThe EA-R method showed significantly different values compared to the EA-GPT method, representing an increase of 17.5-20.7% for the proximal surfaces. An insignificant difference between the two methods was observed for other surfaces. Different teeth classes showed variation in the normal range, thereby resulting in a new classification of the EA for all-natural teeth based on the interquartile range. The machine learning gradient boosting model predicted conventional data with an average mean absolute error of 0.9.\nVariations in the natural teeth EA and measurement methods, suggest a new classification for EA. The established artificial intelligence method demonstrated robust performance, which could aid in implementing EA measurement in prosthetic designs.", "Currently, entrepreneurship is a priority for economic, social, and technological growth. Therefore, the interest in understanding entrepreneurship processes has increased significantly. Individual variables play a fundamental role, and academic research has pointed out the influence of emotional intelligence in entrepreneurial processes; however, its relationship with other interpersonal processes and individual variables, such as personality and self-efficacy, has not been extensively studied. The aim of this research was to analyze the relationship among emotional intelligence, self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial intention, controlling for the effects of personality, gender, and age. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were applied through a questionnaire survey of 1,593 college students to test the relationship between the constructs in the model. The results show that the personality traits are associated with entrepreneurial self-efficacy, emotional intelligence positively influences entrepreneurial intention, and self-efficacy mediates the relationship between emotional intelligence and entrepreneurial intention. Practical implications for training programs are examined, and future lines of research were discussed.", "This study explored the effect of chatbot emotional disclosure on user satisfaction and reuse intention for a chatbot counseling service. It also examined the independent and sequential mediation roles of user emotional disclosure intention and perceived intimacy with a chatbot on the relationship between chatbot emotional disclosure, user satisfaction, and reuse intention for chatbot counseling. In total, 348 American adults were recruited to participate in a mental health counseling session with either of the two types of artificial intelligence-powered mental health counseling chatbots. These included a chatbot disclosing factual information only or a chatbot disclosing humanlike emotions. The results revealed that chatbot emotional disclosure significantly increased user satisfaction and reuse intention for a chatbot counseling service. The results further revealed that user emotional disclosure intention and perceived intimacy with a chatbot independently and serially mediates the effect of chatbot emotional disclosure on user satisfaction and chatbot counseling service reuse intention. The results indicate positive effects of artificial emotions and their disclosure in the context of chatbot moderated mental health counseling. Practical implications and psychological mechanisms are discussed.", "Academic research to the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) has been proliferated over the past few years. While AI and its subsets are continuously evolving in the fields of marketing, social media and finance, its application in the daily practice of clinical care is insufficiently explored. In this systematic review, we aim to landscape various application areas of clinical care in terms of the utilization of machine learning to improve patient care. Through designing a specific smart literature review approach, we give a new insight into existing literature identified with AI technologies in the clinical domain. Our review approach focuses on strategies, algorithms, applications, results, qualities, and implications using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling. A total of 305 unique articles were reviewed, with 115 articles selected using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling, meeting our inclusion criteria. The primary result of this approach incorporates a proposition for future research direction, abilities, and influence of AI technologies and displays the areas of disease management in clinics. This research concludes with disease administrative ramifications, limitations, and directions for future research.", "The labor migration in China often leads to parent-child separation. Research to date has primarily focused on understanding mental and cognitive outcomes for children exposed to parent-child separation, with little consideration for the cumulative effects of intergenerational continuity of parent-child separation. A total of 2729 children between the ages of 4 and 6, along with one parent (primarily mothers, 86.2%) and/or one primary caregiver (if the child is separated from both parents), were recruited in the rural area of Anhui Province, China. A unique subsample of children (n\u00a0=\u00a0249) with persistent experience of parent-child separation or whose mother reported being left behind by her parents during early childhood were enrolled for cognitive assessment. A total of 239 age-, gender- and residence-matched children without any parent-child separation experience were selected as the control group. Child cognitive performance was examined with the Chinese version of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth edition (WPPSI-IV). The association between intergenerational continuity of parent-child separation and child cognition was described using multivariate OLS regression models. Compared to mother-offspring dyads without any history of parent-child separation, girls (n\u00a0=\u00a0236/450, 52.4%) who experienced the intergenerational continuity of parent-child separation showed a significant decrease of 5.73 points (95% CI: -9.83, -1.62; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) on full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) and a decrease of 5.71 points (95% CI: -9.80, 1.63; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) on verbal comprehension index. No similar result was observed in boys. The cumulative effects of parent-child separation among mother-offspring dyads on child cognitive development highlight the need for effective early intervention to break the intergenerational cycle of disadvantage. Sex differences and possible epigenetic mechanisms underlying the intergenerational effects of parent-child separation warrant further investigation.", "To help advance exchanges between science and policy, a useful first step is to examine the questions which policymakers pose to scientists. The style of a question indicates what the asker is motivated to know, and how they might use that knowledge. Therefore, the aggregate pattern of typical policy inquires can help scientists anticipate what types of information policy audiences desire. A dataset (n\u2009=\u20092972) of questions from policymakers collected over 10\u00a0years (2011-2021)-by the Centre for Science and Policy at the University of Cambridge-was classified into one of seven classes. In the main, the most popular questions posed by policymakers-within the public and private sectors-were those whose answers inform how to achieve specific outcomes-whether directly, or by providing a causal analysis which is instrumental to this process. Moreover, this seems to be a general aspect of policymakers' inquiries, given that it is preserved regardless of the policy issue considered (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Economy, or Health). Thus, maximizing the usefulness of the information that policymakers receive when engaging with scientists requires informing how to achieve specific outcomes-directly, or by providing a useful causal analysis.", "Artificial intelligence systems recently demonstrated an increase in polyp and adenoma detection rate. Over the daytime, the adenoma detection rate decreases as tiredness leads to a lack of attention. It is not clear if a polyp detection system with artificial intelligence leads to constant adenoma detection over the day.\nWe performed a database analysis of screening and surveillance colonoscopies with and without the use of AI. In both groups, patients were investigated with the same endoscopy equipment and by the same endoscopists. Only patients with good bowel preparation (BBPS &gt;6) were included. We correlated the daytime, the investigational time, day of the week, and the adenoma and polyp detection.\nA total of 303 colonoscopies were analyzed. 163 endoscopies in the AI+ group and 140 procedures in the AI- group were included. In both groups, the total adenoma detection rate was equal (AI+ 0.39 vs. AI- 0.43). The adenoma detection rate throughout the day had a significant decreasing trend in the group without the use of AI (p = 0.015), whereas this trend was not present in the investigations that have been performed with AI (p = 0.65). The duration of investigation did not show a significant difference between the groups (8.9 min in both groups). No relevant effect was noticed in adenoma detection between single days of the working week with or without the use of AI.\nAI helps overcome the decay in adenoma detection over the daytime. This may be attributed to a constant awareness caused by the use of the AI system.", "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative conducts active surveillance of adverse events of special interest (AESI) after COVID-19 vaccination. Historical incidence rates (IRs) of AESI are comparators to evaluate safety.\nWe estimated IRs of 17 AESI in six administrative claims databases from January 1, 2019, to December 11, 2020: Medicare claims for adults\u202f\u2265\u202f65\u202fyears and commercial claims (Blue Health Intelligence\u00ae, CVS Health, HealthCore Integrated Research Database, IBM\u00ae MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Database, Optum pre-adjudicated claims) for adults\u202f<\u202f65\u202fyears. IRs were estimated by sex, age, race/ethnicity (Medicare), and nursing home residency (Medicare) in 2019 and for specific periods in 2020.\nThe study included >100 million enrollees annually. In 2019, rates of most AESI increased with age. However, compared with commercially insured adults, Medicare enrollees had lower IRs of anaphylaxis (11 vs 12-19 per 100,000 person-years), appendicitis (80 vs 117-155), and narcolepsy (38 vs 41-53). Rates were higher in males than females for most AESI across databases and varied by race/ethnicity and nursing home status (Medicare). Acute myocardial infarction (Medicare) and anaphylaxis (all databases) IRs varied by season. IRs of most AESI were lower during March-May 2020 compared with March-May 2019 but returned to pre-pandemic levels after May 2020. However, rates of Bell's palsy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, narcolepsy, and hemorrhagic/non-hemorrhagic stroke remained lower in multiple databases after May 2020, whereas some AESI (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation) exhibited higher rates after May 2020 compared with 2019.\nAESI background rates varied by database and demographics and fluctuated in March-December 2020, but most returned to pre-pandemic levels after May 2020. It is critical to standardize demographics and consider seasonal and other trends when comparing historical rates with post-vaccination AESI rates in the same database to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine safety.", "Ethics of technology systems have become an area of interest in academic research as well as international policy in recent years. Several organisation have consequently published principles of ethical artificial intelligence (AI) in line with this trend. The documents identify principles, values, and other abstract requirements for AI development and deployment. Critics raise concerns about whether these documents are in fact constructive, or if they are produced as a higher form of virtue signalling. A theme that is beginning to become apparent in the academic literature regarding these documents is the inherent lack of effective and practical methods and processes for producing ethical AI. This article attempts a critical analysis which draws upon ethical AI documents from a range of contexts including company, organisational, governmental, and academic perspectives. Both the theoretical and practical components of AI guidelines are explored and analysed, consequently bringing to light the necessity of introducing a measurable component to such documents for the purpose of ensuring a positive outcome of deploying AI systems based on ethical principles. We propose a minimal framework for stakeholders to develop AI in an ethical and human-centred manner.", "The Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) was introduced to complement the direct anti-doping approach by indirectly outlining the possible use of prohibited substances or methods in sports. The ABP proved its effectiveness, at least through a deterrent effect, even though the matrices used for longitudinal monitoring (urine and blood) are subject to many intrinsic (e.g., genetic) and extrinsic (e.g., environmental conditions) confounding factors. In that context, new and more specific biomarkers are currently under development to enhance both the sensitivity and the specificity of the ABP. Multiple strategies are presently being explored to improve this longitudinal monitoring, with the development of the current modules, the investigation of new strategies, or the screening of new types of doping. Nevertheless, due to the variability induced by indirect biomarkers, the consideration of confounding factors should continuously support this research. Beyond tremendous advances in analytical sensitivity, machine learning-based approaches seem inevitable to facilitate an expert interpretation of numerous biological profiles and promote anti-doping efforts. This perspective article highlights the current innovations of the Athlete Biological Passport that seem the most promising. Through different research axes, this short manuscript provides an opportunity to bring together approaches that are more widely exploited (e.g., omics strategies) and others in the early stages of investigation (e.g., artificial intelligence) seeking to develop the ABP.", "Sensing biomarkers in exhaled breath offers a potentially portable, cost-effective, and noninvasive strategy for disease diagnosis screening and monitoring, while high sensitivity, wide sensing range, and target specificity are critical challenges. We demonstrate a deep learning-assisted plasmonic sensing platform that can detect and quantify gas-phase biomarkers in breath-related backgrounds of varying complexity. The sensing interface consisted of Au/SiO2 nanopillars covered with a 15 nm metal-organic framework. A small camera was utilized to capture the plasmonic sensing responses as images, which were subjected to deep learning signal processing. The approach has been demonstrated at a classification accuracy of 95 to 98% for the diabetic ketosis marker acetone within a concentration range of 0.5-80 \u03bcmol/mol. The reported work provides a thorough exploration of single-sensor capabilities and sets the basis for more advanced utilization of artificial intelligence in sensing applications.", "This study aimed to automatically classify live cells based on their cell type by analyzing the patterns of backscattered signals of cells with minimal effect on normal cell physiology and activity. Our previous studies have demonstrated that label-free acoustic sensing using high-frequency ultrasound at a high pulse repetition frequency (PRF) can capture and analyze a single object from a heterogeneous sample. However, eliminating possible errors in the manual setting and time-consuming processes when postprocessing integrated backscattering (IB) coefficients of backscattered signals is crucial. In this study, an automated cell-type classification system that combines a label-free acoustic sensing technique with deep learning-empowered artificial intelligence models is proposed. We applied an one-dimensional (1D) convolutional autoencoder to denoise the signals and conducted data augmentation based on Gaussian noise injection to enhance the robustness of the proposed classification system to noise. Subsequently, denoised backscattered signals were classified into specific cell types using convolutional neural network (CNN) models for three types of signal data representations, including 1D CNN models for waveform and frequency spectrum analysis and two-dimensional (2D) CNN models for spectrogram analysis. We evaluated the proposed system by classifying two types of cells (e.g., RBC and PNT1A) and two types of polystyrene microspheres by analyzing their backscattered signal patterns. We attempted to discover cell physical properties reflected on backscattered signals by controlling experimental variables, such as diameter and structure material. We further evaluated the effectiveness of the neural network models and efficacy of data representations by comparing their accuracy with that of baseline methods. Therefore, the proposed system can be used to classify reliably and precisely several cell types with different intrinsic physical properties for personalized cancer medicine development.", "Mental retardation (MR) is a group of mental disorders characterized by low intelligence and social adjustment difficulties. Early diagnosis is beneficial for the timely intervention of children with MR to ease the degree of disability. Children with MR always have impaired speech functions compared to normal children, which is significant for clinical diagnosis. On the basis of this, our study proposes a spontaneous speech-based framework (MT-Net) for screening MR, which merges mobile inverted bottleneck convolutional blocks (MBConv) and visual Transformer blocks. MT-Net takes log-mel spectrograms converted from raw interview speech as data source, and utilizes MBConv and visual Transformer to learn low-level and high-level features well. In addition, SpecAugment, a data augmentation strategy, has been used to expand our audio dataset to further enhance the performance of MT-Net. The experimental results show that our proposed MT-Net outperforms Transformer networks (ViT) and convolutional neural networks (ResNet18, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetV2), achieving accuracy of 91.60% after using SpecAugment. Our proposed MT-Net has fewer parameters, low computing consumption and high prediction accuracy, which is expected to be an auxiliary screening tool for MR.", "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have a huge potential in toxicology research. They may be used to predict toxicity of various chemical compounds or classify the compounds based on their toxic effects. Today, numerous ANN models have been developed, some of which may be used to detect and possibly explain complex chemico-biological interactions. Fully connected multilayer perceptrons may in some circumstances have high classification accuracy and discriminatory power in separating damaged from intact cells after exposure to a toxic substance. Regularized and not fully connected convolutional neural networks can detect and identify discrete changes in patterns of two-dimensional data associated with toxicity. Bayesian neural networks with weight marginalization sometimes may have better prediction performance when compared to traditional approaches. With the further development of artificial intelligence, it is expected that ANNs will in the future become important parts of various accurate and affordable biosensors for detection of various toxic substances and evaluation of their biochemical properties. In this concise review article, we discuss the recent research focused on the scientific value of ANNs in evaluation and prediction of toxicity of chemical compounds.", "The coronavirus pandemic strongly impacted the higher education system, challenging university students, who were required to make a considerable effort in terms of revising their personal study approach and managing their emotions. The present study aimed to examine the impact of Trait Emotional Intelligence (TEI) on Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) strategies directly, and indirectly through the mediation of COVID-19 perceived stress (PS) and Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU). 1055 Italian university students (mean age\u00a0=\u00a022.44\u00a0years, SD\u00a0=\u00a02.39) reached via social media, filled out the tools assessing TEI, COVID-19 PS, IU and SRL. Five mediation analyses performed with PROCESS showed that TEI positively predicted all SRL dimensions, and negatively influenced COVID-19 PS and Prospective and Inhibitory IU. COVID-19 PS and Inhibitory and Prospective IU differently predicted specific SRL dimensions. The indirect effects observed suggest that TEI may help university students to cope with stressful and uncertain psychological experiences in order to achieve higher levels of SRL strategies. The study highlights that TEI plays a pivotal role in academic SRL strategies, underlining the importance of its buffering effect in distressing circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic.", "It is common practice in the educational system to foster high mathematical abilities in schools as well as in specific promotional programs. Still, little is known about the construct of mathematical giftedness itself. In line with intellectual investment theories, our study investigates the relationship between fluid intelligence (figural and numerical), openness, and the need for cognition with mathematical abilities. The current study is based on a sample (N = 115) of seventh graders participating in the application process for a promotion program. The results of our regression analyses show a positive link between fluid intelligence and mathematical abilities. However, neither the association with openness nor the need for cognition reached significance, emphasizing the importance of cognitive abilities for mathematical giftedness. Limitations and further directions are discussed.", "Neocortex expansion and folding are related to human intelligence and cognition, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical folding remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the human gene SERPINA3 is linked to gyrification. Specifically, the overexpression of SERPINA3 induced neocortical folding, increased the abundance of neurons, and improved cognitive abilities. Further, SERPINA3 promoted proliferation of the outer radial glia (oRG, also referred to as the basal radial glia) and increased the number of upper-layer neurons. The downstream target Glo1 was determined to be involved in SERPINA3-induced gyrification. Moreover, SERPINA3 increased the proliferation of oRG by binding to the Glo1 promoter. Assessment of behavior performance showed enhanced cognitive abilities in SERPINA3 knock-in mice. Our findings will enrich the understanding of neocortical expansion and gyrification and provide insights into possible treatments for intellectual disability and lissencephaly syndrome.", "The field of optimal experimental design uses mathematical techniques to determine experiments that are maximally informative from a given experimental setup. Here we apply a technique from artificial intelligence-reinforcement learning-to the optimal experimental design task of maximizing confidence in estimates of model parameter values. We show that a reinforcement learning approach performs favourably in comparison with a one-step ahead optimisation algorithm and a model predictive controller for the inference of bacterial growth parameters in a simulated chemostat. Further, we demonstrate the ability of reinforcement learning to train over a distribution of parameters, indicating that this approach is robust to parametric uncertainty.", "With a shortfall in fellowship-trained breast radiologists, mammography screening programs are looking toward artificial intelligence (AI) to increase efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. External validation studies provide an initial assessment of how promising AI algorithms perform in different practice settings.\nTo externally validate an ensemble deep-learning model using data from a high-volume, distributed screening program of an academic health system with a diverse patient population.\nIn this diagnostic study, an ensemble learning method, which reweights outputs of the 11 highest-performing individual AI models from the Digital Mammography Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) Mammography Challenge, was used to predict the cancer status of an individual using a standard set of screening mammography images. This study was conducted using retrospective patient data collected between 2010 and 2020 from women aged 40 years and older who underwent a routine breast screening examination and participated in the Athena Breast Health Network at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\nPerformance of the challenge ensemble method (CEM) and the CEM combined with radiologist assessment (CEM+R) were compared with diagnosed ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive cancers within a year of the screening examination using performance metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).\nEvaluated on 37\u202f317 examinations from 26\u202f817 women (mean [SD] age, 58.4 [11.5] years), individual model AUROC estimates ranged from 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75-0.79) to 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81-0.85). The CEM model achieved an AUROC of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84-0.87) in the UCLA cohort, lower than the performance achieved in the Kaiser Permanente Washington (AUROC, 0.90) and Karolinska Institute (AUROC, 0.92) cohorts. The CEM+R model achieved a sensitivity (0.813 [95% CI, 0.781-0.843] vs 0.826 [95% CI, 0.795-0.856]; P\u2009=\u2009.20) and specificity (0.925 [95% CI, 0.916-0.934] vs 0.930 [95% CI, 0.929-0.932]; P\u2009=\u2009.18) similar to the radiologist performance. The CEM+R model had significantly lower sensitivity (0.596 [95% CI, 0.466-0.717] vs 0.850 [95% CI, 0.766-0.923]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and specificity (0.803 [95% CI, 0.734-0.861] vs 0.945 [95% CI, 0.936-0.954]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) than the radiologist in women with a prior history of breast cancer and Hispanic women (0.894 [95% CI, 0.873-0.910] vs 0.926 [95% CI, 0.919-0.933]; P\u2009=\u2009.004).\nThis study found that the high performance of an ensemble deep-learning model for automated screening mammography interpretation did not generalize to a more diverse screening cohort, suggesting that the model experienced underspecification. This study suggests the need for model transparency and fine-tuning of AI models for specific target populations prior to their clinical adoption.", "Human activity recognition can deduce the behaviour of one or more people from a set of sensor measurements. Despite its widespread applications in monitoring activities, robotics, and visual surveillance, accurate, meticulous, precise and efficient human action recognition remains a challenging research area. As human beings are moving towards the establishment of a smarter planet, human action recognition using ambient intelligence has become an area of huge potential. This work presents a method based on Bi-Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-CRNN) -based Feature Extraction and then Random Forest classification for achieving outcomes utilizing Ambient Intelligence that are at the cutting edge of human action recognition for Autonomous Robots. The auto fusion technique used has improved fusion for utilizing and processing data from various sensors. This paper has drawn comparisons with already existing algorithms for Human Action Recognition (HAR) and tried to propose a heuristic and constructive hybrid deep learning-based algorithm with an accuracy of 94.7%.", "SCENIC (International Consensus Statement on Surveillance and Management of Dysplasia in IBD) guidelines recommend that visible dysplasia in patients with longstanding inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) should be endoscopically characterized using a modified Paris classification. This study aimed to determine the interobserver agreement (IOA) of the modified Paris classification and endoscopists' accuracy for pathology prediction of IBD visible lesions.\nOne hundred deidentified endoscopic still images and 30 videos of IBD visible colorectal lesions were graded by 10 senior and 4 trainee endoscopists from 5 tertiary care centers. Endoscopists were asked to assign 4 classifications for each image: the standard Paris classification, modified Paris classification, pathology prediction, and lesion border. Agreement was measured using Light's kappa coefficient. Consensus of ratings was assessed according to strict majority.\nThe overall Light's kappa for all study endpoints was between .32 and .49. In a subgroup analysis between junior and senior endoscopists, Light's kappa continued to be less than .6 with a slightly higher agreement among juniors. Lesions with the lowest agreement and no consensus were mostly classified as Is, IIa, and mixed Paris classification and sessile and superficial elevated for modified Paris classification. Endoscopist accuracy for prediction of dysplastic, nondysplastic, and serrated pathology was 77%, 56%, and 30%, respectively. There was a strong association (P\u00a0< .001) between the given morphology classification and the predicted pathology with Ip lesions carrying a much lower expectation of dysplasia than Is/IIc/III and mixed lesions. The agreement for border prediction was .5 for junior and .3 for senior endoscopists.\nThis study demonstrates very low IOA for Paris and modified Paris classifications and low accuracy and IOA for lesion histopathology prediction. Revisions of these classifications are required to create a clinically useful risk stratification tool and enable eventual application of augmented intelligence tools.", "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied to the screening tasks of fundus diseases. However, few studies focused on the potential of AI to aid medical teaching in the residency training program. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the AI-based pathologic myopia (PM) identification system in the ophthalmology residency training program and assess the residents' feedback on this system. Materials and Methods: Ninety residents in the ophthalmology department at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University were randomly assigned to three groups. In group A, residents learned PM through an AI-based PM identification system. In group B and group C, residents learned PM through a traditional lecture given by two senior specialists independently. The improvement in resident performance was evaluated by comparing the pre-and post-lecture scores of a specifically designed test using a paired t-test. The difference among the three groups was evaluated by one-way ANOVA. Residents' evaluations of the AI-based PM identification system were measured by a 17-item questionnaire. Results: The post-lecture scores were significantly higher than the pre-lecture scores in group A (p < 0.0001). However, there was no difference between pre-and post-lecture scores in group B (p = 0.628) and group C (p = 0.158). Overall, all participants were satisfied and agreed that the AI-based PM identification system was effective and helpful to acquire PM identification, myopic maculopathy (MM) classification, and \"Plus\" lesion localization. Conclusion: It is still difficult for ophthalmic residents to promptly grasp the knowledge of identification of PM through a single traditional lecture, while the AI-based PM identification system effectively improved residents' performance in PM identification and received satisfactory feedback from residents. The application of the AI-based PM identification system showed advantages in promoting the efficiency of the ophthalmology residency training program.", "Background and study aims\u2002 Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to impact several fields within gastroenterology. In gastrointestinal endoscopy, AI-based tools have translated into clinical practice faster than expected. We aimed to evaluate the status of research for AI in gastroenterology while predicting its future applications. Methods\u2002 All studies registered on Clinicaltrials.gov up to November 2021 were analyzed. The studies included used AI in gastrointestinal endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hepatology, and pancreatobiliary diseases. Data regarding the study field, methodology, endpoints, and publication status were retrieved, pooled, and analyzed to observe underlying temporal and geographical trends. Results\u2002 Of the 103 study entries retrieved according to our inclusion/exclusion criteria, 76 (74\u200a%) were based on AI application to gastrointestinal endoscopy, mainly for detection and characterization of colorectal neoplasia (52/103, 50\u200a%). Image analysis was also more frequently reported than data analysis for pancreaticobiliary (six of 10 [60\u200a%]), liver diseases (eight of nine [89\u200a%]), and IBD (six of eight [75\u200a%]). Overall, 48 of 103 study entries (47\u200a%) were interventional and 55 (53\u200a%) observational. In 2018, one of eight studies (12.5\u200a%) were interventional, while in 2021, 21 of 34 (61.8\u200a%) were interventional, with an inverse ratio between observational and interventional studies during the study period. The majority of the studies were planned as single-center (74 of 103 [72\u200a%]) and more were in Asia (45 of 103 [44\u200a%]) and Europe (44 of 103 [43\u200a%]). Conclusions\u2002 AI implementation in gastroenterology is dominated by computer-aided detection and characterization of colorectal neoplasia. The timeframe for translational research is characterized by a swift conversion of observational into interventional studies.", "Although some improvements in the management of pancreatic cancer (PC) have been made, no major breakthroughs in terms of biomarker discovery or effective treatment have emerged. Here, we applied artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to develop a model to diagnose PC and predict survival outcome.\nMultiple bioinformatics methods, including Limma Package, were performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PC. A Back Propagation (BP) model was constructed, followed by Genetic Algorithm (GA) filtering and verification of its prognosis capacity in the TCGA cohort. Furthermore, we validated the protein expression of the selected DEGs in 92 clinical PC tissues using immunohistochemistry. Finally, intro studies were performed to assess the function of SLC6A14 and SPOCK1 on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells proliferation and apoptosis.\nFour candidate genes (LCN2, SLC6A14, SPOCK1, and VCAN) were selected to establish a four-gene signature for PC. The gene signature was validated in the TCGA PC cohort, and found to show satisfactory discrimination and prognostic power. Areas under the curve (AUC) values of overall survival were both greater than 0.60 in the TCGA training cohort, test cohort, and the entire cohort. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that high-risk group had a significantly shorter overall survival and disease-free survival than the low-risk group. Further, the elevated expression of SLC6A14 and SPOCK1 in PC tissues was validated in the TCGA + GETx datasets and 92 clinical PC tissues, and was significantly associated with poor survival in PC. In PDAC cell line, SLC6A14 or SPOCK1 knockdown inhibited cells proliferation, migration and promoted cells apoptosis.\nUsing Limma Package and GA-ANN, we developed and validated a diagnostic and prognostic gene signature that yielded excellent predictive capacity for PC patients' survival. In vitro studies were further conducted to verify the functions of SLC6A14 and SPOCK1 in PC progression.", "Colonoscopy can detect colorectal adenomas and reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer, but there are still many missing diagnoses. Artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy (AIAC) can effectively reduce the rate of missed diagnosis and improve the detection rate of adenoma, but its clinical application is still unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the adenoma missed detection rate (AMR) and the adenoma detection rate (ADR) by artificial colonoscopy.\nConduct a comprehensive literature search using the PubMed, Medline database, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. This meta-analysis followed the direction of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the preferred reporting item for systematic review and meta-analysis. The random effect model was used for meta-analysis.\nA total of 12 articles were eventually included in the study. Computer aided detection (CADe) significantly decreased AMR compared with the control group (137/1039, 13.2% vs 304/1054, 28.8%; OR,0.39; 95% CI, 0.26-0.59; P < .05). Similarly, there was statistically significant difference in ADR between the CADe group and control group, respectively (1835/5041, 36.4% vs 1309/4553, 28.7%; OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.39-1.71; P < .05). The advanced adenomas missed rate and detection rate in CADe group was not statistically significant when compared with the control group.\nAIAC can effectively reduce AMR and improve ADR, especially small adenomas. Therefore, this method is worthy of clinical application. However, due to the limitations of the number and quality of the included studies, more in-depth studies are needed in the field of AIAC in the future.", "Diabetic heart disease is a major healthcare problem. Patients with diabetes show an excess of death from cardiovascular causes, twice as high as the general population and those with diabetes type 1 and longer duration of the disease present with more severe cardiovascular complications. Premature coronary artery disease and heart failure are leading causes of morbidity and reduced life expectancy. Multimodality cardiac imaging, including echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, nuclear medicine, and cardiac magnetic resonance play crucial role in the diagnosis and management of different pathologies included in the definition of diabetic heart disease. In this review we summarise the utility of multi-modality cardiac imaging in characterising ischaemic and non-ischaemic causes of diabetic heart disease and give an overview of the current clinical practice. We also describe emerging imaging techniques enabling early detection of coronary artery inflammation and the non-invasive characterisation of the atherosclerotic plaque disease. Furthermore, we discuss the role of MRI-derived techniques in studying altered myocardial metabolism linking diabetes with the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Finally, we discuss recent data regarding the use of artificial intelligence applied to large imaging databases and how those efforts can be utilised in the future in screening of patients with diabetes for early signs of disease.", "The radiotherapy (RT) process from planning to treatment delivery is a multistep, complex operation involving numerous levels of human-machine interaction and requiring high precision. These steps are labor-intensive and time-consuming and require meticulous coordination between professionals with diverse expertise. We reviewed and summarized the current status and prospects of artificial intelligence and machine learning relevant to the various steps in RT treatment planning and delivery workflow specifically in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We also searched the PubMed database using the search terms (Artificial Intelligence OR Machine Learning OR Deep Learning OR Automation OR knowledge-based planning AND Radiotherapy) AND (list of Low- and Middle-Income Countries as defined by the World Bank at the time of writing this review). The search yielded a total of 90 results, of which results with first authors from the LMICs were chosen. The reference lists of retrieved articles were also reviewed to search for more studies. No language restrictions were imposed. A total of 20 research items with unique study objectives conducted with the aim of enhancing RT processes were examined in detail. Artificial intelligence and machine learning can improve the overall efficiency of RT processes by reducing human intervention, aiding decision making, and efficiently executing lengthy, repetitive tasks. This improvement could permit the radiation oncologist to redistribute resources and focus on responsibilities such as patient counseling, education, and research, especially in resource-constrained LMICs.", "Despite the growing availability of artificial intelligence models for predicting type 2 diabetes, there is still a lack of personalized approaches to quantify minimum viable changes in biomarkers that may help reduce the individual risk of developing disease. The aim of this article is to develop a new method, based on counterfactual explanations, to generate personalized recommendations to reduce the one-year risk of type 2 diabetes. Ten routinely collected biomarkers extracted from Electronic Medical Records of 2791 patients at low risk and 2791 patients at high risk of type 2 diabetes were analyzed. Two regions characterizing the two classes of patients were estimated using a Support Vector Data Description classifier. Counterfactual explanations (i.e., minimal changes in input features able to change the risk class) were generated for patients at high risk and evaluated using performance metrics (availability, validity, actionability, similarity, and discriminative power) and a qualitative survey administered to seven expert clinicians. Results showed that, on average, the requested minimum viable changes implied a significant reduction of fasting blood sugar, systolic blood pressure, and triglycerides and a significant increase of high-density lipoprotein in patients at risk of diabetes. A significant reduction in body mass index was also recommended in most of the patients at risk, except in females without hypertension. In general, greater changes were recommended in hypertensive patients compared to non-hypertensive ones. The experts were overall satisfied with the proposed approach although in some cases the proposed recommendations were deemed insufficient to reduce the risk in a clinically meaningful way. Future research will focus on a larger set of biomarkers and different comorbidities, also incorporating clinical guidelines whenever possible. Development of additional mathematical and clinical validation approaches will also be of paramount importance.", "The landscape of dental education is undergoing a paradigm shift from both the learner's and teacher's perspectives. Evolving technologies, including artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality, are providing synergistic opportunities to create new and exciting educational platforms. The evolution of these platforms will likely play a significant role in dental education. This is especially true in the wake of calamities like the COVID-19 pandemic during which educational activities had to be shutdown or moved online. This experience demonstrated that it is prudent to develop curricula that are both agile and efficient via creating hybrid courses that provide effective learning experiences regardless of the mode of delivery. Although there is growing interest in incorporating technology into dental education, there are few examples of how to actually manage the implementation of technology into the curriculum. In this paper, we provide a road map for incorporating technology into the dental curriculum to create agility and discuss challenges and possible solutions.", "Health literacy has been identified an essential factor in leading a healthy lifestyle. Because some cancer prevention and screening methods have been established, we believe that identifying disadvantaged populations with low literacy regarding cancer is crucial. Thus, in this study, we aim to create a self-administered cancer-specific health literacy scale to be administered to Japanese laypersons.\nUsing definitions from previous studies, we constructed a scale named the Japanese Cancer Intelligence Quotient (JCIQ) for both literacy (JCIQ-L) and knowledge (JCIQ-K) aspects. We generated potential items for both aspects, extracted appropriate ones using two-step online surveys, and compared the JCIQ and cancer-preventive behaviors and cancer-screening intentions, both of which we set as alternative indicators of the right attitude and practice toward cancer by performing a multiple regression analysis from another web survey.\nBetween April and May 2020, we conducted three-step surveys online. After conducting the two-step surveys for thousands of people, we extracted 12 literacy questions and 22 knowledge questions using factor analysis and the correct answer ratio of every item. In the final investigation of 3,094 people, a multiple regression analysis found that the JCIQ-L and JCIQ-K were significant factors in terms of predicting both behaviors (JCIQ-L:\u03b2 = 0.07, p < 0.001, JCIQ-K:\u03b2 = 0.05, p < 0.01) and willingness (JCIQ-L:\u03b2 = 0.04, p < 0.05, JCIQ-K:\u03b2 = 0.17, p < 0.001) after adjusting for participant characteristics (e.g., gender, age, income level, employment status).\nWe developed the first reliable scale for measuring cancer literacy and knowledge of Japanese laypersons.", "This study examined the relationship between perfectionistic concerns (PC) and perfectionistic strivings (PS) with the subcomponents of emotional intelligence (EI) through a latent class person-centered approach. A sample of 1582 Ecuadorian adolescents (619 females) aged from 12 to 18 was employed. The trait meta-mood scale-24 (TMMS-24) and the child and adolescent perfectionism scale (CAPS) were used, respectively, for assessing three subcomponents of EI (i.e., emotional attention, emotional clarity, and mood repair) and two perfectionist dimensions (PC and PS). A three-class solution (High perfectionism, moderate perfectionism, and nonperfectionism) was identified by using latent class analysis. High perfectionism significantly scored higher on emotional attention in comparison with the moderate and nonperfectionism classes, with small and moderate effect sizes. Overall, results suggest that people with high perfectionism might be at greater risk of developing maladaptive emotional self-regulation strategies, such as rumination, because of their tendency to excessively attend their negative mood states.", "Many studies have investigated listener perceptions of speakers who use vocal fry, but results remain mixed. This study aimed to investigate how vocal fry and speaker gender impact listener perceptions of a speaker's likeability, intelligence, attractiveness, and salary-attainment, described as \"attributes.\" We hypothesized speakers with vocal fry would be evaluated more negatively on all attributes than speakers without vocal fry, with female speakers rated more negatively than male speakers.\nTwenty nine listeners rated male and female speakers with and without vocal fry on these attributes using a five-point Likert scale.\nThis experiment used a randomized mixed methods design with Vocal Fry and Speaker Gender as independent variables predicting attribute ratings.\nResults of a MANOVA revealed a significant main effect for Fry (\u039b\u00a0=\u00a00.607; F(4,29)\u00a0=\u00a04.691; \u03b7p2\u00a0=\u00a00.393; P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), where speakers with vocal fry were rated significantly more negatively than speakers without vocal fry. Additionally, there was a significant Fry by Speaker Gender interaction where female speakers without vocal fry were rated as significantly more attractive [F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a013.964; P= 0.003; \u03b7p2\u00a0=\u00a00.304] and intelligent [F(1,36)\u00a0=\u00a010.740; P = 0.001; \u03b7p2\u00a0=\u00a00.251] than female speakers with vocal fry. There was no significant difference between ratings of male speakers in either fry condition.\nFemale speakers with vocal fry were rated as less attractive and intelligent than female speakers without vocal fry, but perception of male speakers did not change whether or not vocal fry was present in the acoustic signal.", "To describe the effect of COVID-19 on ophthalmic training programs and to review the various roles of technology in ophthalmology surgical education including virtual platforms, novel remote learning curricula, and the use of surgical simulators.\nCOVID-19 caused significant disruption to in-person clinical and surgical patient encounters. Ophthalmology trainees worldwide faced surgical training challenges due to social distancing restrictions, trainee redeployment, and reduction in surgical case volume. Virtual platforms, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, were widely used during the pandemic to conduct remote teaching sessions. Novel virtual wet lab and dry lab curricula were developed. Training programs found utility in virtual reality surgical simulators, such as the Eyesi, to substitute experience lost from live patient surgical cases.\nAlthough several of these described technologies were incorporated into ophthalmology surgical training programs prior to COVID-19, the pandemic highlighted the importance of developing a formal surgical curriculum that can be delivered virtually. Novel telementoring, collaboration between training institutions, and hybrid formats of didactic and practical training sessions should be continued. Future research should investigate the utility of augmented reality and artificial intelligence for trainee learning.", "Our demand for ubiquitous and reliable gas detection is spurring the design of intelligent and enabling gas sensors for the next-generation Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. The desire to introduce gas sensors everywhere is fueled by opportunities to create room-temperature semiconductor gas sensors with ultralow power consumption. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the recent achievement of room-temperature gas sensors that have been translated from the advances in the design of the chemical and physical properties of low-dimensional semiconductor nanomaterials. The emergence of solution-processable nanomaterials opens up remarkable opportunities to integrate into high-performance and flexible room-temperature gas sensors by using low-temperature, large-area, solution-based methods instead of costly, high-vacuum, high-temperature device manufacturing processes. We review the fundamental factors which affect the receptor and transducer functions of semiconductor gas sensors. We also discuss challenges that must be addressed in the move to the continuous miniaturization and evolution of semiconductor gas sensors.", "Classification using spatial data is foundational for hydrological modelling, particularly for ungauged areas. However, models developed from classified land use drivers deliver inconsistent water quality results for the same land uses and hinder decision-making guided by those models. This paper explores whether the temporal variation of water quality drivers, such as season and flow, influence inconsistency in the classification, and whether variability is captured in spatial datasets that include original vegetation to represent the variability of biotic responses in areas mapped with the same land use. An Artificial Neural Network Pattern Recognition (ANN-PR) method is used to match catchments by Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) patterns in water quality datasets partitioned into Wet vs Dry Seasons and Increasing vs Retreating flows. Explainable artificial intelligence approaches are then used to classify catchments via spatial feature datasets for each catchment. Catchments matched for sharing patterns in both spatial data and DIN datasets were corroborated and the benefit of partitioning the observed DIN dataset evaluated using Kruskal Wallis method. The highest corroboration rates for spatial data classification with DIN classification were achieved with seasonal partitioning of water quality datasets and significant independence (p < 0.001 to 0.026) from non-partitioned datasets was achieved. This study demonstrated that DIN patterns fall into three categories suited to classification under differing temporal scales with corresponding vegetation types as the indicators. Categories 1 and 3 included dominance of woodlands in their datasets and catchments suited to classify together change depending on temporal scale of the data. Category 2 catchments were dominated by vineforest and classified catchments did not change under different temporal scales. This demonstrates that including original vegetation as a proxy for differences in DIN patterns will help guide future classification where only spatially mapped data is available for ungauged catchments and will better inform data needs for water modelling.", "In order to achieve better performance, artificial intelligence is used in breast cancer diagnosis. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of different fine-tuning strategies of deep transfer learning (DTL) based on the DenseNet201 model to differentiate malignant from benign lesions on breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). We collected 4260 images of benign lesions and 4140 images of malignant lesions of the breast pertaining to pathologically confirmed cases. The benign and malignant groups was randomly divided into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 9:1. A DTL model based on the DenseNet201 model was established, and the effectiveness of 4 fine-tuning strategies (S0: strategy 0, S1: strategy; S2: strategy; and S3: strategy) was compared. Additionally, DCE-MRI images of 48 breast lesions were selected to verify the robustness of the model. Ten images were obtained for each lesion. The classification was considered correct if more than 5 images were correctly classified. The metrics for model performance evaluation included accuracy (Ac) in the training and testing sets, precision (Pr), recall rate (Rc), f1 score (f1), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) in the validation set. The Ac of the 4 fine-tuning strategies reached 100.00% in the training set. The S2 strategy exhibited good convergence in the testing set. The Ac of S2 was 98.01% in the testing set, which was higher than those of S0 (93.10%), S1 (90.45%), and S3 (93.90%). The average classification Pr, Rc, f1, and AUROC of S2 in the validation set were (89.00%, 80.00%, 0.81, and 0.79, respectively) higher than those of S0 (76.00%, 67.00%, 0.69, and 0.65, respectively), S1 (60.00%, 60.00%, 0.60, 0.66, and respectively), and S3 (77.00%, 73.00%, 0.74, 0.72, respectively). The degree of coincidence between S2 and the histopathological method for differentiating between benign and malignant breast lesions was high (\u03ba\u2005=\u20050.749). The S2 strategy can improve the robustness of the DenseNet201 model in relatively small breast DCE-MRI datasets, and this is a reliable method to increase the Ac of discriminating benign from malignant breast lesions on DCE-MRI.", "Novel approaches in mobile mental health (mHealth) apps that make use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Ecological Momentary Assessments, and Ecological Momentary Interventions have the potential to support young people in the achievement of mental health and wellbeing goals. However, little is known on the perspectives of young people and mental health experts on this rapidly advancing technology. This study aims to investigate the subjective needs, attitudes, and preferences of key stakeholders towards an AI-informed mHealth app, including young people and experts on mHealth promotion and prevention in youth.\nWe used a convergent parallel mixed-method study design. Two semi-structured online focus groups (n\u2009=\u20098) and expert interviews (n\u2009=\u20095) to explore users and stakeholders perspectives were conducted. Furthermore a representative online survey was completed by young people (n\u2009=\u2009666) to investigate attitudes, current use and preferences towards apps for mental health promotion and prevention.\nSurvey results show that more than two-thirds of young people have experience with mHealth apps, and 60% make regular use of 1-2 apps. A minority (17%) reported to feel negative about the application of AI in general, and 19% were negative about the embedding of AI in mHealth apps. This is in line with qualitative findings, where young people displayed rather positive attitudes towards AI and its integration into mHealth apps. Participants reported pragmatic attitudes towards data sharing and safety practices, implying openness to share data if it adds value for users and if the data request is not too intimate, however demanded transparency of data usage and control over personalization. Experts perceived AI-informed mHealth apps as a complementary solution to on-site delivered interventions in future health promotion among young people. Experts emphasized opportunities in regard with low-threshold access through the use of smartphones, and the chance to reach young people in risk situations.\nThe findings of this exploratory study highlight the importance of further participatory development of training components prior to implementation of a digital mHealth training in routine practice of mental health promotion and prevention. Our results may help to guide developments based on stakeholders' first recommendations for an AI-informed mHealth app.", "To analyse medical students' perceptions of the impact of artificial intelligence in radiology.\nA structured questionnaire comprising 28 items organised into six sections was distributed to students of medicine in Spain in December 2019.\nA total of 341 students responded. Of these, 27 (7.9%) included radiology among their three main choices for specialization, and 51.9% considered that they clearly understood what artificial intelligence is. The overall rate of correct answers to the objective true-or-false questions about artificial intelligence was 70.7%. Whereas 75.9% expressed their disagreement with the hypothesis that artificial intelligence would replace radiologists, only 41.9% disagreed with the hypothesis that the demand for radiologists would decrease in the future. Only 36.7% expressed concerns about the role of artificial intelligence related to choosing radiology as a specialty. A greater proportion of students in the early years of medical school agreed with statements that radiologists accept artificial-intelligence-related technological changes and work with the industry to apply them as well as with statements about the need to include basic training about artificial intelligence in the medical school curriculum.\nThe students surveyed are aware of the impact of artificial intelligence in daily life, but not of the current debate about its potential applications in radiology. In general, they think that artificial intelligence will revolutionise radiology without having an alarming effect on the employability of radiologists. The students surveyed think that it is necessary to provide basic training about artificial intelligence in undergraduate medical school programs.", "During the epidemic, online teaching became the mainstream. Online teaching evaluation aims to systematically test teachers' teaching process according to certain teaching objectives and standards, and evaluate its value, advantages and disadvantages, so as to improve the quality of teaching. It is not only an important part of the teaching process, but also the basis of all effective and successful teaching. In this paper, we propose an online teaching evaluation method based on Epistemic Neural Network (ENN), which is an evolutionary intelligence method. In terms of uncertainty modeling, ENN's design innovation provides the improvement effect of geometric progression in terms of statistical quality and calculation cost. Therefore, it is very suitable for teaching evaluation, which is an evaluation process guided by a variety of uncertain factors. Specifically, this paper considers the content and grade standards of online teaching evaluation from five aspects. (1) Teachers' syllabus, teaching progress, teaching plan, courseware and other teaching documents and teaching materials; (2) Abide by teaching discipline, the implementation of teaching plan and the completion of teaching tasks; (3) Teaching attitude, teaching investment, teaching and educating people, and the comprehensive quality of teachers; (4) Whether the concepts taught in the course are accurate, the expression is clear, whether the key points are prominent and whether the difficulties are clearly explained; (5) The depth, breadth and frontier of teaching content, and the amount of classroom information. According to the above five evaluation indexes which involves the big data analysis, we train ENN to get an evaluation score that can evaluate the teacher's online teaching process. In addition, we also test the average evaluation time to verify the effectiveness.", "In this study, we advance a robust methodology for identifying specific intelligence-related proteins across phyla. Our approach exploits a support vector machine-based classifier capable of predicting intelligence-related proteins based on a pool of meaningful protein features. For the sake of illustration of our proposed general method, we develop a novel computational two-layer predictor, Intell_Pred, to predict query sequences (proteins or transcripts) as intelligence-related or non-intelligence-related proteins or transcripts, subsequently classifying the former sequences into learning and memory-related classes. Based on a five-fold cross-validation and independent blind test, Intell_Pred obtained an average accuracy of 87.48 and 88.89, respectively. Our findings revealed that a score >0.75 (during prediction by Intell_Pred) is a well-grounded choice for predicting intelligence-related candidate proteins in most organisms across biological kingdoms. In particular, we assessed seismonastic movements and associate learning in plants and evaluated the proteins involved using Intell_Pred. Proteins related to seismonastic movement and associate learning showed high percentages of similarities with intelligence-related proteins. Our findings lead us to believe that Intell_Pred can help identify the intelligence-related proteins and their classes using a given protein/transcript sequence.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds considerable promise for diagnostics in the field of gastroenterology. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of AI models compared with the gold standard of experts and histopathology for the diagnosis of various gastrointestinal (GI) luminal pathologies including polyps, neoplasms, and inflammatory bowel disease.\nWe searched PubMed, CINAHL, Wiley Cochrane Library, and Web of Science electronic databases to identify studies assessing the diagnostic performance of AI models for GI luminal pathologies. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data and constructed contingency tables to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity and specificity. We performed a meta-analysis and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves (HSROC). The risk of bias was assessed using Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on the type of GI luminal disease, AI model, reference standard, and type of data used for analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021288360).\nWe included 73 studies, of which 31 were externally validated and provided sufficient information for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The overall sensitivity of AI for detecting GI luminal pathologies was 91.9% (95% CI: 89.0-94.1) and specificity was 91.7% (95% CI: 87.4-94.7). Deep learning models (sensitivity: 89.8%, specificity: 91.9%) and ensemble methods (sensitivity: 95.4%, specificity: 90.9%) were the most commonly used models in the included studies. Majority of studies (n = 56, 76.7%) had a high risk of selection bias while 74% (n = 54) studies were low risk on reference standard and 67% (n = 49) were low risk for flow and timing bias.\nThe review suggests high sensitivity and specificity of AI models for the detection of GI luminal pathologies. There is a need for large, multi-center trials in both high income countries and low- and middle- income countries to assess the performance of these AI models in real clinical settings and its impact on diagnosis and prognosis.\n[https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=288360], identifier [CRD42021288360].", "The SI-CURA project (Soluzioni Innovative per la gestione del paziente e il follow up terapeutico della Colite UlceRosA) is an Italian initiative aimed at the development of artificial intelligence solutions to discriminate pathologies of different nature, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), namely Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), based on endoscopic imaging of patients (P) and healthy controls (N).\nIn this study we develop a deep learning (DL) prototype to identify disease patterns through three binary classification tasks, namely (1) discriminating positive (pathological) samples from negative (healthy) samples (P vs N); (2) discrimination between Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease samples (UC vs CD) and, (3) discrimination between Ulcerative Colitis and negative (healthy) samples (UC vs N).\nThe model derived from our approach achieves a high performance of Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) >\u00a00.9 on the test set for P versus N and UC versus N, and MCC\u00a0>\u00a00.6 on the test set for UC versus CD.\nOur DL model effectively discriminates between pathological and negative samples, as well as between IBD subgroups, providing further evidence of its potential as a decision support tool for endoscopy-based diagnosis.", "The emergence of collective intelligence has been studied in much greater detail in small groups than in larger ones. Nevertheless, in groups of several hundreds or thousands of members, it is well-known that the social environment exerts a considerable influence on individual behavior. A few recent papers have dealt with some aspects of large group situations, but have not provided an in-depth analysis of the role of interactions among the members of a group in the creation of ideas, as well as the group's overall performance. In this study, we report an experiment where a large set of individuals, i.e., 789 high-school students, cooperated online in real time to solve two different examinations on a specifically designed platform (Thinkhub). Our goal of this paper 6 to describe the specific mechanisms of idea creation we were able to observe and to measure the group's performance as a whole. When we deal with communication networks featuring a large number of interacting entities, it seems natural to model the set as a complex system by resorting to the tools of statistical mechanics. Our experiment shows how an interaction in small groups that increase in size over several phases, leading to a final phase where the students are confronted with the most popular answers of the previous phases, is capable of producing high-quality answers to all examination questions, whereby the last phase plays a crucial role. Our experiment likewise shows that a group's performance in such a task progresses in a linear manner in parallel with the size of the group. Finally, we show that the controlled interaction and dynamics foreseen in the system can reduce the spread of \"fake news\" within the group.", "Herein, we report intriguing observations of an extremely stable nonvolatile bipolar resistive switching (NVBRS) memory device fabricated using HfO2-TiO2 topologically protected by Al2O3 as a stacked base layer for a CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) electrolyte layer sandwiched between Ag and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes. MAPI has been successfully synthesized by a rapid microwave-solvothermal (MW-ST) method within 10 min at 120 \u00b0C without requiring any inert gas atmosphere using low-cost precursors and solvents. Subsequently, MAPI powders are dissolved in aprotic solvents (DMF/DMSO = 8:2), and a spin-coated thin film is allowed to recrystallize upon annealing at 120 \u00b0C via a solution-based nanoscale self-assembly process. The fabricated memory device with the Ag/MAPI/Al2O3/TiO2-HfO2/FTO configuration shows an enhanced resistance ratio of 105 for >104 s at an extremely lower operating voltage (SET +0.2 V, RESET -0.2 V) when compared to that of the pristine MAPI device (\u00b11 V, 102, 104 s). We show that the memory device also exhibits a remarkable endurance of \u22653500 cycles due to the Al2O3 robust coating on the HfO2-TiO2 layer, facilitating prompt heterojunction formation. Thus, the adopted innovative strategies to prepare structurally and optically stable (\u223c1.5 years) MAPI under high-humid conditions could offer enhanced performance of NVBRS memory devices for medical, security, internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.", "Maternal prenatal infections have been linked to children's neurodevelopment and cognitive outcomes. It remains unclear, however, whether infections occurring during specific vulnerable gestational periods can affect children's cognitive outcomes. The study aimed to examine maternal infections in each trimester of pregnancy and associations with children's developmental and intelligence quotients. The ALSPAC birth cohort was used to investigate associations between maternal infections in pregnancy and child cognitive outcomes.\nInfection data from mothers and cognition data from children were included with the final study sample size comprising 7,410 mother-child participants. Regression analysis was used to examine links between maternal infections occurring at each trimester of pregnancy and children's cognition at 18 months, 4 years, and 8 years.\nInfections in the third trimester were significantly associated with decreased verbal IQ at age 4 (p\u2009<\u2009.05, adjusted R2\u2009=\u20090.004); decreased verbal IQ (p\u2009<\u2009.01, adjusted R2\u2009=\u20090.001), performance IQ (p\u2009<\u2009.01, adjusted R2\u2009=\u20090.0008), and total IQ at age 8 (p\u2009<\u2009.01, adjusted R2\u2009=\u20090.001).\nResults suggest that maternal infections in the third trimester could have a latent effect on cognitive development, only emerging when cognitive load increases over time, though magnitude of effect appears to be small. Performance IQ may be more vulnerable to trimester-specific exposure to maternal infection as compared to verbal IQ. Future research could include examining potential mediating mechanisms on childhood cognition, such as possible moderating effects of early childhood environmental factors, and if effects persist in future cognitive outcomes.", "Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT) can be used to screen high risk patients for atrial fibrillation (AF). These devices rely primarily on algorithmic detection of AF events, which are then stored and transmitted to a clinician for review. It is critical the positive predictive value (PPV) of MCOT detected AF is high, and this often leads to reduced sensitivity, as device manufacturers try to limit false positives.\nThe purpose of this study was to design a two stage classifier using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the PPV of MCOT detected atrial fibrillation episodes whilst maintaining high levels of detection sensitivity.\nA low complexity, RR-interval based, AF classifier was paired with a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to create a two-stage classifier. The DCNN was limited in size to allow it to be embedded on MCOT devices. The DCNN was trained on 491,727 ECGs from a proprietary database and contained 128,612 parameters requiring only 158\u00a0KB of storage. The performance of the two-stage classifier was then assessed using publicly available datasets.\nThe sensitivity of AF detected by the low complexity classifier was high across all datasets (>93%) however the PPV was poor (<76%). Subsequent analysis by the DCNN increased episode PPV across all datasets substantially (>11%), with only a minor loss in sensitivity (<5%). This increase in PPV was due to a decrease in the number of false positive detections. Further analysis showed that DCNN processing was only required on around half of analysis windows, offering a significant computational saving against using the DCNN as a one-stage classifier.\nDCNNs can be combined with existing MCOT classifiers to increase the PPV of detected AF episodes. This reduces the review burden for physicians and can be achieved with only a modest decrease in sensitivity.", "This short research report focuses on psychologist Leon Kamin, who is best known for his research on what became known as the Kamin (blocking) effect. In the 1970s and 1980s he became prominent both inside and outside of psychology, not for laboratory research but for his writings on the heritability of intelligence. Kamin was no stranger to political activism. He joined the Communist Party U.S.A. at age 17, when he was a sophomore at Harvard. By 1949, he was writing for the Daily Worker (pen name: Leo Soft) and was employed as its New England editor in 1949-1950. In January 1954, Kamin was called to testify by Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist Senate subcommittee, which was visiting Boston and justified its interest in Harvard by citing its winning research grants from the U.S. Department of Defense. Kamin refused to \"name names\" and he was indicted for contempt of the Senate.

Polyploid plants like bananas (Musa spp.) face the problem of drought and black sigatoka disease (BSD) that restrict their production. The conventional plant breeding is experiencing difficulties, particularly phenotyping costs and long generation interval. To overcome these difficulties, GS in plant breeding is explored as an alternative with a great potential for reducing costs and time in selection process. So far, GS does not have the same success in polyploid plants as with diploid plants because of the complexity of their genome. In this review, we present the main constraints to the application of GS in polyploid plants and the prospects for overcoming these constraints. Particular emphasis is placed on breeding for BSD and drought-two major threats to banana production-used in this review as a model of polyploid plant. It emerges that the difficulty in obtaining markers of good quality in polyploids is the first challenge of GS on polyploid plants, because the main tools used were developed for diploid species. In addition to that, there is a big challenge of mastering genetic interactions such as dominance and epistasis effects as well as the genotype by environment interaction, which are very common in polyploid plants. To get around these challenges, we have presented bioinformatics tools, as well as artificial intelligence approaches, including machine learning. Furthermore, a scheme for applying GS to banana for BSD and drought has been proposed. This review is of paramount impact for breeding programs that seek to reduce the selection cycle of polyploids despite the complexity of their genome.", "In this review, we focus on the use of contemporary linear and non-linear data analytics as well as machine learning/artificial intelligence algorithms to inform treatment of pediatric patients. We specifically focus on methods used to quantify changes in breathing that can lead to increased risk for apnea of prematurity, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and provide a list of potentially useful algorithms that comprise a suite of software tools to enhance prediction of outcome. Next, we provide a brief overview of machine learning/artificial intelligence methods and applications within the sphere of perinatal care. Finally, we provide an overview of the infrastructure needed to use these tools in a clinical setting for real-time data acquisition, data synchrony, data storage and access, and bedside data visualization to assist in clinical decision making and support the medical informatics mission. Our goal is to provide an overview and inspire other investigators to adopt these tools for their own research and optimization of perinatal patient care.", "Recent evidence sheds light on the peculiar type of plant intelligence. Plants have developed complex molecular networks that allow them to remember, choose, and make decisions depending on the stress stimulus, although they lack a nervous system. Being sessile, plants can exploit these networks to optimize their resources cost-effectively and maximize their fitness in response to multiple environmental stresses. Even more interesting is the capability to transmit this experience to the next generation(s) through epigenetic modifications that add to the classical genetic inheritance. In this opinion article, we present concepts and perspectives regarding the capabilities of plants to sense, perceive, remember, re-elaborate, respond, and to some extent transmit to their progeny information to adapt more efficiently to climate change.", "This systematic review examined to what extent response demands of executive functioning (EF) tasks influence the relationship between motor performance and EF in 2- to 6-year-old typically developing (TD) children and children with motor coordination difficulties (MCD). Eighteen of the included articles focused on TD children only and three also on children with MCD. EF tasks were subdivided based on the type of responses (i.e., motor or verbal). EF tasks requiring a motor response were subdivided into two levels (i.e., complex or simple). Results showed that the relationship between motor performance and EF in 2- to 6-year-old TD children and children with MCD was inconclusive with the strength of correlation coefficients for the most part varying from very weak to moderate. The type of EF task response did not influence the relationship between motor performance and EF. The review thus implies that other task demands than the type of EF task response need to be investigated to explain the inconsistent relationship between motor performance and EF, such as the complexity of the motor response of EF tasks, the complexity of the actual motor tasks, and additional processes (e.g., memory, intelligence, language comprehension).", "Currently, tumor treatments are characterized by intelligence, diversity and personalization, but the therapeutic reagents used are often limited in clinical efficacy due to problems with water solubility, targeting, stability and multidrug resistance. To remedy these shortcomings, the application of multifunctional nanotechnology in the biomedical field has been widely studied. Synthetic melanin nanoparticles (MNPs) surfaces which contain highly reactive chemical groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and amine groups, can be used as a reaction platform on which to graft different functional components. In addition, MNPs easily adhere to substrate surface, and serve as a secondary reaction platform to modify it. The multifunctionality and intrinsic biocompatibility make melanin-like nanoparticles promising as a multifunctional and powerful nanoplatform for oncological applications. This paper first reviews the preparation methods, polymerization mechanisms and physicochemical properties of melanin including natural melanin and chemically synthesized melanin to guide scholars in MNP-based design. Then, recent advances in MNPs especially synthetic polydopamine (PDA) melanin for various medical oncological applications are systematically and thoroughly described, mainly focusing on bioimaging, photothermal therapy (PTT), and drug delivery for tumor therapy. Finally, based on the investigated literature, the current challenges and future directions for clinical translation are reasonably discussed, focusing on the innovative design of MNPs and further elucidation of pharmacokinetics. This paper is a timely and comprehensive and detailed study of the progress of MNPs in tumor therapy, especially PTT, and provides ideas for the design of personalized and customizable oncology nanomedicines to address the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment.", "Cancer centers have an urgent and unmet clinical and research need for AI that can guide patient management. A core component of advancing cancer treatment research is assessing response to therapy. Doing so by hand, for example, as per RECIST or RANO criteria, is tedious and time-consuming, and can miss important tumor response information. Most notably, the prevalent response criteria often exclude lesions, the non-target lesions, altogether. We wish to assess change in a holistic fashion that includes all lesions, obtaining simple, informative, and automated assessments of tumor progression or regression. Because genetic sub-types of cancer can be fairly specific and patient enrollment in therapy trials is often limited in number and accrual rate, we wish to make response assessments with small training sets. Deep neuroevolution (DNE) is a novel radiology artificial intelligence (AI) optimization approach that performs well on small training sets. Here, we use a DNE parameter search to optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts progression versus regression of metastatic brain disease. We analyzed 50 pairs of MRI contrast-enhanced images as our training set. Half of these pairs, separated in time, qualified as disease progression, while the other 25 image pairs constituted regression. We trained the parameters of a CNN via \"mutations\" that consisted of random CNN weight adjustments and evaluated mutation \"fitness\" as summed training set accuracy. We then incorporated the best mutations into the next generation's CNN, repeating this process for approximately 50,000 generations. We applied the CNNs to our training set, as well as a separate testing set with the same class balance of 25 progression and 25 regression cases. DNE achieved monotonic convergence to 100% training set accuracy. DNE also converged monotonically to 100% testing set accuracy. We have thus shown that\u00a0DNE can accurately classify brain metastatic disease progression versus regression. Future work will extend the input from 2D image slices to full 3D volumes, and include the category of \"no change.\" We believe that an approach such as ours can ultimately provide a useful and informative complement to RANO/RECIST assessment and volumetric AI analysis.", "Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is an underdiagnosed, progressive, and disabling condition. Early treatment is associated with better outcomes and improved quality of life. In this paper, the authors aimed to identify features associated with patients with iNPH using natural language processing (NLP) to characterize this cohort, with the intention to later target the development of artificial intelligence-driven tools for early detection.\nThe electronic health records of patients with shunt-responsive iNPH were retrospectively reviewed using an NLP algorithm. Participants were selected from a prospectively maintained single-center database of patients undergoing CSF diversion for probable iNPH (March 2008-July 2020). Analysis was conducted on preoperative health records including clinic letters, referrals, and radiology reports accessed through CogStack. Clinical features were extracted from these records as SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) concepts using a named entity recognition machine learning model. In the first phase, a base model was generated using unsupervised training on 1 million electronic health records and supervised training with 500 double-annotated documents. The model was fine-tuned to improve accuracy using 300 records from patients with iNPH double annotated by two blinded assessors. Thematic analysis of the concepts identified by the machine learning algorithm was performed, and the frequency and timing of terms were analyzed to describe this patient group.\nIn total, 293 eligible patients responsive to CSF diversion were identified. The median age at CSF diversion was 75 years, with a male predominance (69% male). The algorithm performed with a high degree of precision and recall (F1 score 0.92). Thematic analysis revealed the most frequently documented symptoms related to mobility, cognitive impairment, and falls or balance. The most frequent comorbidities were related to cardiovascular and hematological problems.\nThis model demonstrates accurate, automated recognition of iNPH features from medical records. Opportunities for translation include detecting patients with undiagnosed iNPH from primary care records, with the aim to ultimately improve outcomes for these patients through artificial intelligence-driven early detection of iNPH and prompt treatment.", "The integration of artificial intelligence into clinical workflows requires reliable and robust models. Repeatability is a key attribute of model robustness. Ideal repeatable models output predictions without variation during independent tests carried out under similar conditions. However, slight variations, though not ideal, may be unavoidable and acceptable in practice. During model development and evaluation, much attention is given to classification performance while model repeatability is rarely assessed, leading to the development of models that are unusable in clinical practice. In this work, we evaluate the repeatability of four model types (binary classification, multi-class classification, ordinal classification, and regression) on images that were acquired from the same patient during the same visit. We study the each model's performance on four medical image classification tasks from public and private datasets: knee osteoarthritis, cervical cancer screening, breast density estimation, and retinopathy of prematurity. Repeatability is measured and compared on ResNet and DenseNet architectures. Moreover, we assess the impact of sampling Monte Carlo dropout predictions at test time on classification performance and repeatability. Leveraging Monte Carlo predictions significantly increases repeatability, in particular at the class boundaries, for all tasks on the binary, multi-class, and ordinal models leading to an average reduction of the 95% limits of agreement by 16% points and of the class disagreement rate by 7% points. The classification accuracy improves in most settings along with the repeatability. Our results suggest that beyond about 20 Monte Carlo iterations, there is no further gain in repeatability. In addition to the higher test-retest agreement, Monte Carlo predictions are better calibrated which leads to output probabilities reflecting more accurately the true likelihood of being correctly classified.", "In the digital dentistry era, new tools, algorithms, data science approaches, and computer applications are available to researchers and clinicians. However, there is also a strong need for better knowledge and understanding of multisource data applications, including three-dimensional imaging information such as cone-beam computed tomography images and digital dental models for multidisciplinary cases. In addition, artificial intelligence models and automated clinical decision systems are rising. The clinician needs to plan the treatment based on state-of-the-art diagnosis for better and more personalized treatment. This article aimed to review basic concepts and the current panorama of digital implant planning in orthodontics, with open-source and closed-source tools for assessing cone-beam computed images and digital dental models. The visualization and processing of the three-dimensional data allow better implant planning based on bone conditions, adjacent teeth and root positions, and the prognosis of the case. We showed that many tools for assessment, segmentation, and visualization of cone-beam computed tomographic images and digital dental models could facilitate the treatment planning of patients needing implants or space closure. The tools and approaches presented are toward personalized treatment and better prognosis, following the path to a more automated clinical decision system based on multisource three-dimensional data, artificial intelligence models, and digital planning. In summary, the orthodontist needs to analyze each patient individually and use different software or tools that better fit their practice, allowing efficient treatment planning and satisfactory results with an adequate prognosis.", "Many technological advances have entered the clinical routine of Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. The new CT scanners have specific solutions in gantry design to bear the mechanical solicitations. The X-ray tubes have been improved for faster acquisitions at low radiation exposure, while the innovations in CT detectors provide a better image quality. The optimization of image quality and contrast, and the reduction of radiation dose, cannot be achieved without the implementation of adequate reconstruction software, such as Iterative Reconstructions (IR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). In recent years, dual-energy (DECT) technology has expanded the indications of CT. In this narrative review, a panoramic overview of the technological novelties in CT imaging will be provided for optimal utilization of CT technology.", "Natural products, and especially the active ingredients found in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), have a thousand-year-long history of clinical use and a strong theoretical basis in TCM. As such, traditional remedies provide shortcuts for the development of original new drugs in China, and increasing numbers of natural products are showing great therapeutic potential in various diseases. This paper reviews the molecular mechanisms of action of natural products from different sources used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer, introduces the methods and newly emerging technologies used to identify and validate the targets of natural active ingredients, enumerates the expansive list of TCM used to treat inflammatory diseases and cancer, and summarizes the patterns of action of emerging technologies such as single-cell multiomics, network pharmacology, and artificial intelligence in the pharmacological studies of natural products to provide insights for the development of innovative natural product-based drugs. Our hope is that we can make use of advances in target identification and single-cell multiomics to obtain a deeper understanding of actions of mechanisms of natural products that will allow innovation and revitalization of TCM and its swift industrialization and internationalization.", "Artificial intelligence-based technologies are gradually being applied to psych-iatric research and practice. This paper reviews the primary literature concerning artificial intelligence-assisted psychosis risk screening in adolescents. In terms of the practice of psychosis risk screening, the application of two artificial intelligence-assisted screening methods, chatbot and large-scale social media data analysis, is summarized in detail. Regarding the challenges of psychiatric risk screening, ethical issues constitute the first challenge of psychiatric risk screening through artificial intelligence, which must comply with the four biomedical ethical principles of respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and impartiality such that the development of artificial intelligence can meet the moral and ethical requirements of human beings. By reviewing the pertinent literature concerning current artificial intelligence-assisted adolescent psychosis risk screens, we propose that assuming they meet ethical requirements, there are three directions worth considering in the future development of artificial intelligence-assisted psychosis risk screening in adolescents as follows: nonperceptual real-time artificial intelligence-assisted screening, further reducing the cost of artificial intelligence-assisted screening, and improving the ease of use of artificial intelligence-assisted screening techniques and tools.", "Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) might have similar problems as in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and show impairment in social behaviour. Also, there is a relationship between social relationship skills and ToM (theory of mind) skills of children with ADHD. Besides, ASD is associated with prenatal exposure to high levels of androgens, and oxytocin plays a role in the modulation of emotions, coping with stress, and social behaviour like ASD. In this study, the relationship between autistic traits and serum oxytocin, testosterone, and androstenedione levels in prepubertal male drug naive children with ADHD has been investigated.\nEighty-three prepubertal children, who were diagnosed with ADHD between the ages of 6-10\u00a0years old, are included in the study. For the study, intelligence levels were evaluated by using WISC-4, and autistic traits were measured by using both social responsiveness scale and theory of mind tests. In addition, serum oxytocin, testosterone, and androstenedione levels were measured by using ELISA.\nIt has been found that serum testosterone levels of patients with lower autistic traits are significantly lower than those with moderate and severe autistic traits, while the serum oxytocin levels are significantly higher. Also, patients with severe autistic traits have had significantly higher serum androstenedione levels than those with lower and moderate autistic traits.\nThis study suggests that patients who have higher autistic traits have elevated testosterone and androstenedione levels and lower serum oxytocin levels. Further studies are needed to clarify this relationship.", "Gene editing has great potential in treating diseases caused by well-characterized molecular alterations. The introduction of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-based gene-editing tools has substantially improved the precision and efficiency of gene editing. The CRISPR/Cas9 system offers several advantages over the existing gene-editing approaches, such as its ability to target practically any genomic sequence, enabling the rapid development and deployment of novel CRISPR-mediated knock-out/knock-in methods. CRISPR/Cas9 has been widely used to develop cancer models, validate essential genes as druggable targets, study drug-resistance mechanisms, explore gene non-coding areas, and develop biomarkers. CRISPR gene editing can create more-effective chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells that are durable, cost-effective, and more readily available. However, further research is needed to define the CRISPR/Cas9 system's pros and cons, establish best practices, and determine social and ethical implications. This review summarizes recent CRISPR/Cas9 developments, particularly in cancer research and immunotherapy, and the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based screening in developing cancer precision medicine and engineering models for targeted cancer therapy, highlighting the existing challenges and future directions. Lastly, we highlight the role of artificial intelligence in refining the CRISPR system's on-target and off-target effects, a critical factor for the broader application in cancer therapeutics.", "Magnetic rings are extensively used in power products where they often operate in high frequency and high current conditions, such as for mitigation of excessive voltages in high-power switchgear equipment. We provide a general model of a magnetic ring that reproduces both frequency and current dependencies with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) optimization methods. The model has a form of a lumped element equivalent circuit that is suitable for power system transient studies. A previously published conventional (non-AI) model, which we take as a starting point, gives a good fit of parameters but uneven characteristics as a function of current, which pose numerical instabilities in transient simulations. We first enforce the Langevin function relationship to obtain smooth characteristics of parameters, which reduces the number of parameters and ensures their even characteristics, however, compromises fit quality. We then use AI metaheuristic optimization methods that give a perfect fit for the model in the whole range of frequency up to 100\u00a0MHz and current up to saturation, with smooth characteristics of its parameters. Additionally, for such fitted parameters, we show that it is feasible to find a frequency dependence for the magnetic saturation parameter of the Jiles-Atherton (JA) model, thus enabling frequency-dependent JA.", "To assess the benefit of a bariatric surgery in four artificial intelligence-identified metabolic (AIM) subtypes of obesity with respect to the improvement of glucometabolism and the remission of diabetes and hyperinsulinemia.\nThis multicenter retrospective study prospectively collected data from five hospitals in China from 2010 to 2021. At baseline 1008 patients who underwent a bariatric surgery were enrolled (median age 31 years; median BMI 38.1kg/m2; 57.40% women) and grouped into the four AIM subtypes. Baseline and follow-up data (506 and 359 patients at 3- and 12-month post-surgery) were collected for longitudinal effect analysis.\nOut of the four AIM subgroups, hypometabolic obesity (LMO) group was characterized by decompensated insulin secretion and high incidence of diabetes (99.2%) pre-surgery. After surgery, 62.1% of LMO patients with diabetes achieved remission, lower than the other three subgroups. Still, the bariatric surgery significantly reduced their blood glucose (median HbA1c decreased by 27.2%). The hypermetabolic obesity-hyperinsulinemia (HMO-I) group was characterized by severe insulin resistance and high incidence of hyperinsulinemia (87.8%) pre-surgery, which had been greatly alleviated post-surgery. For both metabolic healthy obesity (MHO) and hypermetabolic obesity-hyperuricemia (HMO-U) groups who showed a relatively healthy glucometabolism pre-surgery, rate of glucometabolic comorbidities improved moderately post-surgery.\nIn terms of glucometabolism, the four AIM subtypes of patients benefited differently from a bariatric surgery, which significantly relieved hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia for the LMO and HMO-I patients, respectively. The AIM-based subtypes may help better inform clinical decisions on bariatric surgery and patient counseling pertaining to post-surgery outcomes.", "450 million years of evolution have given chondrichthyans (sharks, rays and allies) ample time to adapt perfectly to their respective everyday life challenges and cognitive abilities have played an important part in that process. The diversity of niches that sharks and rays occupy corresponds to matching diversity in brains and behaviour, but we have only scratched the surface in terms of investigating cognition in this important group of animals. The handful of species that have been cognitively assessed in some detail over the last decade have provided enough data to safely conclude that sharks and rays are cognitively on par with most other vertebrates, including mammals and birds. Experiments in the lab as well as in the wild pose their own unique challenges, mainly due to the handling and maintenance of these animals as well as controlling environmental conditions and elimination of confounding factors. Nonetheless, significant advancements have been obtained in the fields of spatial and social cognition, discrimination learning, memory retention as well as several others. Most studies have focused on behaviour and the underlying neural substrates involved in cognitive information processing are still largely unknown. Our understanding of shark cognition has multiple practical benefits for welfare and conservation management but there are obvious gaps in our knowledge. Like most marine animals, sharks and rays face multiple threats. The effects of climate change, pollution and resulting ecosystem changes on the cognitive abilities of sharks and stingrays remain poorly investigated and we can only speculate what the likely impacts might be based on research on bony fishes. Lastly, sharks still suffer from their bad reputation as mindless killers and are heavily targeted by commercial fishing operations for their fins. This public relations issue clouds people's expectations of shark intelligence and is a serious impediment to their conservation. In the light of the fascinating results presented here, it seems obvious that the general perception of sharks and rays as well as their status as sentient, cognitive animals, needs to be urgently revisited.", "New digital technologies can become a tool for welcoming the patient through the artistic dimension. Cancer patients, in particular, need support that accompanies and supports them throughout their treatment.\nThe Art4ART project consist in the structural proposal to cancer patients of a web-based digital platform containing several forms of art as video-entertainments; a multimedia immersive room; an art-based welcoming of the patients with several original paintings; an environment with a peacefulness vertical garden; a reconceptualization of the chemotherapy-infusion seats. Data regarding patients' preference and choices will be stored and analysed also using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to measure and predict impact indicators regarding clinical outcomes (survival and toxicity), psychological indicators. Moreover, the same digital platform will contribute to a better organization of the activities.\nThrough the systematic acquisition of patient preferences and through integration with other clinical parameters, it will be possible to measure the clinical, psychological, organisational, and social impact of the newly implemented Art4ART project. The use of digital technology leads us to apply the reversal of viewpoint from therapeutic acts to patient-centred care.", "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Imaging tests such as chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) can provide useful information to clinical staff for facilitating a diagnosis of COVID-19 in a more efficient and comprehensive manner. As a breakthrough of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning has been applied to perform COVID-19 infection region segmentation and disease classification by analyzing CXR and CT data. However, prediction uncertainty of deep learning models for these tasks, which is very important to safety-critical applications like medical image processing, has not been comprehensively investigated. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble deep learning model through integrating bagging deep learning and model calibration to not only enhance segmentation performance, but also reduce prediction uncertainty. The proposed method has been validated on a large dataset that is associated with CXR image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the segmentation performance, as well as decrease prediction uncertainty.", "In the study and treatment of psychosis, emotional intelligence (EI) and thinking styles are important patient characteristics for successful outcomes in clinical intervention. Anticipation of unpredictable stimuli (AUS) may be understood as an anomalous perception and anomalous cognition in which an individual supposedly senses and recognizes future stimuli in an unexpected way, also referred to as \"hunches or premonitions.\" This examined the roles of EI and thinking styles in AUSs in convenience samples of healthy participants (n = 237) versus patients diagnosed with psychosis (n = 118). We adjusted several quadratic and exponential regression models according to the obtained functions. Group means were also compared to examine differences in EI scores for participants with psychosis compared to healthy participants. In the healthy group, EI predicted AUSs with a weight between 42% and 58%. Thinking styles were not correlated with AUSs. However, EI was not correlated with AUSs in the clinical group. Patients with psychosis tended to score higher on AUSs and lower on EI and thinking styles compared to participants in the healthy group. We discuss EI as a variable that can contextualize some anomalous perceptions which are otherwise difficult to classify or measure within the classic psychosis continuum model.", "This review will cover the most relevant findings on the use of machine learning (ML) techniques in the field of non-affective psychosis, by summarizing the studies published in the last three years focusing on illness detection and treatment.\nMultiple ML tools that include mostly supervised approaches such as support vector machine, gradient boosting, and random forest showed promising results by applying these algorithms to various sources of data: socio-demographic information, EEG, language, digital content, blood biomarkers, neuroimaging, and electronic health records. However, the overall performance, in the binary classification case, varied from 0.49, which is to be considered very low (i.e., noise), to over 0.90. These results are fully justified by different factors, some of which may be attributable to the preprocessing of the data, the wide variety of the data, and the a-priori setting of hyperparameters. One of the main limitations of the field is the lack of stratification of results based on biological sex, given that psychosis presents differently in men and women; hence, the necessity to tailor identification tools and data analytic strategies. Timely identification and appropriate treatment are key factors in reducing the consequences of psychotic disorders. In recent years, the emergence of new analytical tools based on artificial intelligence such as supervised ML approaches showed promises as a potential breakthrough in this field. However, ML applications in everyday practice are still in its infancy.", "To develop and validate artificial intelligence models for the prediction of cognitive impairment in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients using structural and functional brain network.\nThis study retrospectively recruited 621 CKD patients and 625 healthy controls in Jinling hospital and 57 CKD patients in Hainan hospital. These CKD patients were divided into cognitive function impairment (CFI) group and non-CFI group based on diagnostic criteria. All patients underwent brain MRI scan, neuropsychological test and laboratory exam. A deep learning model (Attention MLP) based on structural and functional sub-network (determined by the comparison between the patients and healthy controls) topological properties was developed to generate the MRI signature for the discrimination of CFI. Finally, a clinical-topological logistic regression model was built by combining MRI signature and clinical features. The area under curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were calculated to evaluate the model performance. Delong test was used to examine the difference of AUCs between models. The integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification index (NRI) between models were calculated.\nAttention MLP model performed well in both internal test set and external test set (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.744 and 0.763, respectively). After combining with the clinical features, the model performance was further improved both in the internal (AUC: 0.748) and external test sets (AUC: 0.774), while both IDI and NRI were significant (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the external test set. According to the comprehensive comparison, the AUC of the Attention MLP model was significantly or marginal significantly higher than that of traditional machine learning models (logistic regression: AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.634; support vector machine: AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.613; decision tree: AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.539; XGBoost: AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.639) in internal test set. The results showed that the model built on the combining of structural and functional networks data outperformed those on the single network, as well as the connection matrix.\nThe result indicated that the integration of the clinical information and the MRI signature generated by artificial intelligence model based on structural and functional network topological properties could help to predict the CFI of CKD patients effectively. Our results provided a set of quantifiable imaging biomarkers for CFI which may be beneficial to CKD patients.", "Continuous efforts to produce functional nanomaterials and flexible/stretchable devices have promoted cumbersome, laboratorial, detection processes toward wearable and portable intelligent sensing approaches. Responding to the challenges of the multiple analytes, mixtures, and complex components of practical samples, sensing array and multivariate analysis techniques have a significant advantage in terms of superior analytical capabilities, i.e., they are convenient, rapid, sensitive and have high-throughput for multi-analyte identification in food safety, clinical diagnoses, and environmental monitoring. Besides traditional molecular design and recognition mechanisms, materials with micro/nano structures also contribute to strong signals, sensitive responses, and novel properties. In this review, through a new perspective of signal amplification for responsive discrimination, we summarize progress in developing sensing arrays based on diverse micro/nanomaterials and their integrated devices for multi-analyte discrimination. An overview of strategies for constructing sensing arrays through various micro or nano building blocks, including 0D nanoparticle assembly and modification, 1D nanowires and fibers, 2D graphene and textiles, is schematized. Then, portable and wearable devices integrating colorimetric sensors or flexible electrochemical electrodes with the newest microelectronic units and circuit boards are presented. Meanwhile, the latest artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are introduced for massive data analysis in complex biological and environmental systems. With future developments in facile and accurate discrimination for multi-analyte research, extended applications will gear up in various fields.", "The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) added a new interpretative level by assigning the ten standard subtests into one of two constructs, the General Ability Index or the Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI). The CPI, inferred to be a non-intellective measure of information processing efficiency, is composed of the two Working Memory Index and the two Processing Speed Index subtests (DS, AR, CD, SS). However, each index has one supplemental subtest that can be used in place of a standard one, thereby creating nine possible CPI tetrads, except for senior adults 70-90. Measuring the equivalence reliability of the nine alternate CPI tetrads was the aim of this study. Using the WAIS-IV standardization data, it was shown that all nine CPI tetrads have exceptionally high subtest equivalence reliability (.90+). For neuropsychological research purposes, all nine CPI constructions can be considered interchangeable, alternate-form measures of composite information processing efficiency. However, more research is needed to establish their accuracy for individual assessment, as well as to measure the other important reliability and predictive construct validity characteristics of the nine CPI tetrads.", "White-light endoscopy with tissue biopsy is the gold standard interface for diagnosing gastric neoplastic lesions. However, misdiagnosis of lesions is a challenge because of operator variability and learning curve issues. These issues have not been resolved despite the introduction of advanced imaging technologies, including narrow band imaging, and confocal laser endomicroscopy. To ensure consistently high diagnostic accuracy among endoscopists, artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been introduced to assist endoscopists in the diagnosis of gastric neoplasia. Current endoscopic AI systems for endoscopic diagnosis are mostly based upon interpretation of endoscopic images. In real-life application, the image-based AI system remains reliant upon skilful operators who will need to capture sufficiently good quality images for the AI system to analyze. Such an ideal situation may not always be possible in routine practice. In contrast, non-image-based AI is less constraint by these requirements. Our group has recently developed an endoscopic Raman fibre-optic probe that can be delivered into the gastrointestinal tract via the working channel of any endoscopy for Raman measurements. We have also successfully incorporated the endoscopic Raman spectroscopic system with an AI system. Proof of effectiveness has been demonstrated in in vivo studies using the Raman endoscopic system in close to 1,000 patients. The system was able to classify normal gastric tissue, gastric intestinal metaplasia, gastric dysplasia and gastric cancer, with diagnostic accuracy of >85%. Because of the excellent correlation between Raman spectra and histopathology, the Raman-AI system can provide optical diagnosis, thus allowing the endoscopists to make clinical decisions on the spot. Furthermore, by allowing non-expert endoscopists to make real-time decisions as well as expert endoscopists, the system will enable consistency of care.", "Quantum computation builds on the use of correlations. Correlations could also play a central role for artificial intelligence, neuromorphic computing or \"biological computing.\" As a step toward a systematic exploration of \"correlated computing\" we demonstrate that neuromorphic computing can perform quantum operations. Spiking neurons in the active or silent states are connected to the two states of Ising spins. A quantum density matrix is constructed from the expectation values and correlations of the Ising spins. We show for a two qubit system that quantum gates can be learned as a change of parameters for neural network dynamics. These changes respect restrictions which ensure the quantum correlations. Our proposal for probabilistic computing goes beyond Markov chains and is not based on transition probabilities. Constraints on classical probability distributions relate changes made in one part of the system to other parts, similar to entangled quantum systems.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) based on the perspective of data elements is widely used in the healthcare informatics domain. Large amounts of clinical data from electronic medical records (EMRs), electronic health records (EHRs), and electroencephalography records (EEGs) have been generated and collected at an unprecedented speed and scale. For instance, the new generation of wearable technologies enables easy-collecting peoples' daily health data such as blood pressure, blood glucose, and physiological data, as well as the application of EHRs documenting large amounts of patient data. The cost of acquiring and processing health big data is expected to reduce dramatically with the help of AI technologies and open-source big data platforms such as Hadoop and Spark. The application of AI technologies in health big data presents new opportunities to discover the relationship among living habits, sports, inheritances, diseases, symptoms, and drugs. Meanwhile, with the development of fast-growing AI technologies, many promising methodologies are proposed in the healthcare field recently. In this paper, we review and discuss the application of machine learning (ML) methods in health big data in two major aspects: (1) Special features of health big data including multimodal, incompletion, time validation, redundancy, and privacy. (2) ML methodologies in the healthcare field including classification, regression, clustering, and association. Furthermore, we review the recent progress and breakthroughs of automatic diagnosis in health big data and summarize the challenges, gaps, and opportunities to improve and advance automatic diagnosis in the health big data field.", "The use of artificial intelligence applications in medicine is becoming increasingly common. At the same time, however, there are few initiatives to teach this important and timely topic to medical students. One reason for this is the predetermined medical curriculum, which leaves very little room for new topics that were not included before. We present a flipped classroom course designed to give undergraduate medical students an elaborated first impression of AI and to increase their \"AI readiness\".\nThe course was tested and evaluated at Bonn Medical School in Germany with medical students in semester three or higher and consisted of a mixture of online self-study units and online classroom lessons. While the online content provided the theoretical underpinnings and demonstrated different perspectives on AI in medical imaging, the classroom sessions offered deeper insight into how \"human\" diagnostic decision-making differs from AI diagnoses. This was achieved through interactive exercises in which students first diagnosed medical image data themselves and then compared their results with the AI diagnoses. We adapted the \"Medical Artificial Intelligence Scale for Medical Students\" to evaluate differences in \"AI readiness\" before and after taking part in the course. These differences were measured by calculating the so called \"comparative self-assessment gain\" (CSA gain) which enables a valid and reliable representation of changes in behaviour, attitudes, or knowledge.\nWe found a statistically significant increase in perceived AI readiness. While values of CSA gain were different across items and factors, the overall CSA gain regarding AI readiness was satisfactory.\nAttending a course developed to increase knowledge about AI in medical imaging can increase self-perceived AI readiness in medical students.", "Bank bailouts are controversial governmental decisions, putting taxpayers' money at risk to avoid a domino effect through the network of claims between financial institutions. Yet very few studies address quantitatively the convenience of government investments in failing banks from the taxpayers' standpoint. We propose a dynamic financial network framework incorporating bailout decisions as a Markov Decision Process and an artificial intelligence technique that learns the optimal bailout actions to minimise the expected taxpayers' losses. Considering the European global systemically important institutions, we find that bailout decisions become optimal only if the taxpayers' stakes exceed some critical level, endogenously determined by all financial network's characteristics. The convenience to intervene increases with the network's distress, taxpayers' stakes, bank bilateral credit exposures and crisis duration. Moreover, the government should optimally keep bailing-out banks that received previous investments, creating moral hazard for rescued banks that could increase their risk-taking, reckoning on government intervention.", "Collective intelligence (CI) in organizational teams has been predominantly understood and explained in terms of the quality of the outcomes that the team produces. This manuscript aims to extend the understanding of CI in teams, by disentangling the core of actual collective intelligent team behavior that unfolds over time during a collaboration period. We posit that outcomes do support the presence of CI, but that collective intelligence itself resides in the interaction processes within the team. Teams behave collectively intelligent when the collective behaviors during the collaboration period are in line with the requirements of the (cognitive) tasks the team is assigned to and the (changing) environment. This perspective results in a challenging, but promising research agenda armed with new research questions that call for unraveling longitudinal fine-grained interactional processes over time. We conclude with exploring methodological considerations that assist researchers to align concept and methodology. In sum, this manuscript proposes a more direct, thorough, and nuanced understanding of collective intelligence in teams, by disentangling micro-level team behaviors over the course of a collaboration period. With this in mind, the field of CI will get a more fine-grained understanding of what really happens at what point in time: when teams behave more or less intelligently. Additionally, when we understand collectively intelligent processes in teams, we can organize targeted interventions to improve or maintain collective intelligence in teams.", "As COVID-19 continues to impact the United States and the world at large it is becoming increasingly necessary to develop methods which predict local scale spread of the disease. This is especially important as newer variants of the virus are likely to emerge and threaten community spread. We develop a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to predict community-level relative risk of COVID-19 infection at the census tract scale in the U.S. state of Indiana. The model incorporates measures of social and environmental vulnerability-including environmental determinants of COVID-19 infection-into a spatial temporal prediction of infection relative risk 1-month into the future. The DBN significantly outperforms five other modeling techniques used for comparison and which are typically applied in spatial epidemiological applications. The logic behind the DBN also makes it very well-suited for spatial-temporal prediction and for \"what-if\" analysis. The research results also highlight the need for further research using DBN-type approaches that incorporate methods of artificial intelligence into modeling dynamic processes, especially prominent within spatial epidemiologic applications.", "Advances in molecular diagnostics accomplished the discovery of two malignant glioma entities harboring alterations in the H3 histone: diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered and diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34-mutant. Radiogenomics research, which aims to correlate tumor imaging features with genotypes, has not comprehensively examined histone-altered gliomas (HAG). The aim of this research was to synthesize the current published data on imaging features associated with HAG.\nA systematic search was performed in March 2022 using PubMed and the Cochrane Library, identifying studies on the imaging features associated with H3 K27-altered and/or H3 G34-mutant gliomas.\nForty-seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, the majority on H3 K27-altered gliomas. Just under half (21/47) were case reports or short series, the remainder being diagnostic accuracy studies. Despite heterogeneous methodology, some themes emerged. In particular, enhancement of H3 K27M-altered gliomas is variable and can be less than expected given their highly malignant behavior. Low apparent diffusion coefficient values have been suggested as a biomarker of H3 K27-alteration, but high values do not exclude this genotype. Promising correlations between high relative cerebral blood volume values and H3 K27-alteration require further validation. Limited data on H3 G34-mutant gliomas suggest some morphologic overlap with 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas.\nThe existing data are limited, especially for H3 G34-mutant gliomas and artificial intelligence techniques. Current evidence indicates that imaging-based predictions of HAG are insufficient to replace histological assessment. In particular, H3 K27-altered gliomas should be considered when occurring in typical midline locations irrespective of enhancement characteristics.", "Animal-borne tagging (bio-logging) generates large and complex datasets. In particular, accelerometer tags, which provide information on behaviour and energy expenditure of wild animals, produce high-resolution multi-dimensional data, and can be challenging to analyse. We tested the performance of commonly used artificial intelligence tools on datasets of increasing volume and dimensionality. By\u00a0collecting bio-logging data across several sampling seasons, datasets are inherently characterized by inter-individual variability. Such information should be considered when predicting behaviour. We integrated both unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches to predict behaviours in two penguin species. The classified behaviours obtained from the unsupervised approach Expectation Maximisation were used to train the supervised approach Random Forest. We assessed agreement between the approaches, the performance of Random Forest on unknown data and the implications for the calculation of energy expenditure. Consideration of behavioural variability resulted in high agreement (>\u200980%) in behavioural classifications and minimal differences in energy expenditure estimates. However, some outliers with\u2009<\u200970% of agreement, highlighted how behaviours characterized by signal similarity are confused. We advise the broad bio-logging community, approaching these large datasets, to be cautious when upscaling predictions, as this might lead to less accurate estimates of behaviour and energy expenditure.", "The use of facial recognition technology has diversified the diagnostic toolbelt for clinicians and researchers for the accurate diagnoses of patients with rare and challenging disorders. Specific identifiers in patient images can be grouped using artificial intelligence to allow the recognition of diseases and syndromes with similar features. Lysosomal storage disorders are rare, and some have prominent and unique features that may be used to train the accuracy of facial recognition software algorithms. Noteworthy features of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) include facial features such as prominent brows, wide noses, thickened lips, mouth, and chin, resulting in coarse and rounded facial features.\nWe evaluated and report the prevalence of facial phenotypes in patients with different LSDs, noting two current examples when artificial intelligence strategies have been utilized to identify distinctive facies.\nSpecific LSDs, including Gaucher disease, Mucolipidosis IV and Fabry disease have recently been distinguished using facial recognition software. Additional lysosomal disorders LSDs lysosomal storage disorders with unique and distinguishable facial features also merit evaluation using this technology. These tools may ultimately aid in the identification of specific LSDs and shorten the diagnostic odyssey for patients with these rare and under-recognized disorders.", "Pressure injury has always been a focus and difficulty of nursing. With the development of nursing informatization, a large amount of structured and unstructured data has been generated, and it is difficult for traditional methods to utilize these data. With the intersection of artificial intelligence and nursing, it has become a new trend to apply machine learning algorithms to build pressure injury prediction models to manage pressure injuries. However, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of the method and which of a large number of algorithms for machine learning is more applicable to pressure injuries.\nThis review aims to systematically synthesize existing evidence to determine the effectiveness of applying machine learning algorithms for pressure injury management, to further evaluate and compare pressure injury prediction models constructed by numerous machine learning algorithms, and to derive evidence for the best algorithms for predicting and managing pressure injuries.\nSystematic review and network meta-analysis.\nA systematic electronic search was conducted in the EBSCO, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. We included all retrospective diagnostic accuracy trials and prospective diagnostic accuracy trials constructing a predictive model by machine learning for pressure injuries up to December 2021. Two review authors independently selected relevant studies and extracted data using the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy. The network meta-analysis was conducted using statistical software R and STATA. The certainty of the evidence was rated using the QUADAS-2 tool.\nTwenty-five clinical diagnostic trials with a total of 237397 participants were identified in this review. The results of our study revealed that pressure injury machine learning models can effectively predict these injuries. Combining the algorithms separately yields the main results: decision trees (sensitivity: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.84, specificity: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.78 to 0.96, diagnostic odds ratio [DOR]: 18, 95% CI: 7 to 49, AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.91), logistic regression (sensitivity: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.80, specificity: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.89, DOR: 12, 95% CI: 9 to 17, AUC: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.87), neural networks (sensitivity: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.86, specificity: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.87, DOR: 9, 95% CI: 5 to 19, AUC: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.85), random forests (sensitivity: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.95, specificity: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.80 to 0.99, DOR: 56, 95% CI: 3 to 1258, AUC: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.97), support vector machines (sensitivity: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.90, specificity: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.93, DOR: 19, 95% CI: 6 to 54, AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.90). According to the analysis of ROC and AUC values, random forest is the best algorithm for the prediction model of pressure injury.\nThis review revealed that machine learning algorithms are generally effective in predicting pressure injuries, and after data merging, the random forest algorithm is the best algorithm for pressure injury prediction. Further well-designed diagnostic controlled trials are recommended to strengthen the current evidence.\nCRD42021276993.", "The brain has effectively proven a powerful inspiration for the development of computing architectures in which processing is tightly integrated with memory, communication is event-driven, and analog computation can be performed at scale. These neuromorphic systems increasingly show an ability to improve the efficiency and speed of scientific computing and artificial intelligence applications. Herein, it is proposed that the brain's ubiquitous stochasticity represents an additional source of inspiration for expanding the reach of neuromorphic computing to probabilistic applications. To date, many efforts exploring probabilistic computing have focused primarily on one scale of the microelectronics stack, such as implementing probabilistic algorithms on deterministic hardware or developing probabilistic devices and circuits with the expectation that they will be leveraged by eventual probabilistic architectures. A co-design vision is described by which large numbers of devices, such as magnetic tunnel junctions and tunnel diodes, can be operated in a stochastic regime and incorporated into a scalable neuromorphic architecture that can impact a number of probabilistic computing applications, such as Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian neural networks. Finally, a framework is presented to categorize increasingly advanced hardware-based probabilistic computing technologies.", "Music plays an essential role in human life and can act as an expression to evoke human emotions. The diversity of music makes the listener's experience of music appear diverse. Different music can induce various emotions, and the same theme can also generate other feelings related to the listener's current psychological state. Music emotion recognition (MER) has recently attracted widespread attention in academics and industry. With the development of brain science, MER has been widely used in different fields, e.g., recommendation systems, automatic music composing, psychotherapy, and music visualization. Especially with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, deep learning-based music emotion recognition is gradually becoming mainstream. Besides, electroencephalography (EEG) enables external devices to sense neurophysiological signals in the brain without surgery. This non-invasive brain-computer signal has been used to explore emotions. This paper surveys EEG music emotional analysis, involving the analysis process focused on the music emotion analysis method, e.g., data processing, emotion model, and feature extraction. Then, challenging problems and development trends of EEG-based music emotion recognition is proposed. Finally, the whole paper is summarized.", "With the advancement of artificial intelligence, robotics education has been a significant way to enhance students' digital competency. In turn, the willingness of teachers to embrace robotics education is related to the effectiveness of robotics education implementation and the sustainability of robotics education. Two hundred and sixty-nine teachers who participated in the \"virtual human education in primary and secondary schools in Guangdong and Henan\" and the questionnaire were used as the subjects of study. UTAUT model and its corresponding scale were modified by deep learning algorithms to investigate and analyze teachers' acceptance of robotics education in four dimensions: performance expectations, effort expectations, community influence and enabling conditions. Findings show that 53.68% of the teachers were progressively exposed to robotics education in the last three years, which is related to the context of the rise of robotics education in schooling in recent years, where contributing conditions have a direct and significant impact on teachers' acceptance of robotics education. The correlation coefficients between teacher performance expectations, effort expectations, community influence, and enabling conditions and acceptance were 0.290 (p = 0.000<0.001), -0.144 (p = 0.048<0.05), 0.396 (p = 0.000<0.001), and 0.422 (p = 0.000<0.001) respectively, indicating that these four core dimensions both had a significant effect on acceptance. Optimization comparison results of deep learning models show that mDAE and AmDAE provide a substantial reduction in training time compared to existing noise-reducing autoencoder models. It is shown that time-complexity of the deep neural network algorithm is positively related to the number of layers of the model.", "Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an emerging ailment of global concern. Its diagnosis at the early stages is critical for recovery. Therefore, efforts are underway to produce digital pathology tools with human-level intelligence that are efficient, scalable, accessible, and cost-effective. Following the trend, a medical imaging challenge on \"Segmentation of Multiple Myeloma Plasma Cells in Microscopic Images (SegPC-2021)\" was organized at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2021, France. The challenge addressed the problem of cell segmentation in microscopic images captured from the slides prepared from the bone marrow aspirate of patients diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma. The challenge released a total of 775 images with 690 and 85 images of sizes 2040\u00d71536 and 1920\u00d72560 pixels, respectively, captured from two different (microscope and camera) setups. The participants had to segment the plasma cells with a separate label on each cell's nucleus and cytoplasm. This problem comprises many challenges, including a reduced color contrast between the cytoplasm and the background, and the clustering of cells with a feeble boundary separation of individual cells. To our knowledge, the SegPC-2021 challenge dataset is the largest publicly available annotated data on plasma cell segmentation in MM so far. The challenge targets a semi-automated tool to ensure the supervision of medical experts. It was conducted for a span of five months, from November 2020 to April 2021. Initially, the data was shared with 696 people from 52 teams, of which 41 teams submitted the results of their models on the evaluation portal in the validation phase. Similarly, 20 teams qualified for the last round, of which 16 teams submitted the results in the final test phase. All the top-5 teams employed DL-based approaches, and the best mIoU obtained on the final test set of 277 microscopic images was 0.9389. All these five models have been analyzed and discussed in detail. This challenge task is a step towards the target of creating an automated MM diagnostic tool.", "China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is currently wrestling with the benefits and challenges of using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance their capabilities. Like many other militaries, a key factor in their analysis is identifying and dealing with the ethical implications of employing AI-enabled systems. Unlike other militaries, however, as the PLA is directly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP-\"the Party\"), such considerations are conspicuously influenced by a definition of military ethics that is fundamentally political. This Mini-Review briefly discusses key tenets of PLA military ethics and then investigates how the challenges of military AI ethics are being addressed in publicly-available government and PLA publications. Analysis indicates that, while the PLA is considering AI ethical challenges that are common to all militaries (e.g., accountability), their overriding challenge that they face is \"squaring the circle\" of benefitting from autonomous AI capabilities while providing the CCP with the absolute control of the PLA that it demands-which is, from the CCP's perspective, a military ethics consideration. All Chinese translations are my own.", "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is an important pathogenic microorganism that causes gastric cancer, peptic ulcers and dyspepsia, and infects more than half of the world's population. Eradicating H. pylori is the most effective means to prevent and treat these diseases. H. pylori coccoid form (HPCF) causes refractory H. pylori infection and should be given more attention in infection management. However, manual HPCF recognition on slides is time-consuming and labor-intensive and depends on experienced pathologists; thus, HPCF diagnosis is rarely performed and often overlooked. Therefore, simple HPCF diagnostic methods need to be developed.\nWe manually labeled 4,547 images from anonymized paraffin-embedded samples in the China Center for H. pylori Molecular Medicine (CCHpMM, Shanghai), followed by training and optimizing the Faster R-CNN and YOLO v5 models to identify HPCF. Mean average precision (mAP) was applied to evaluate and select the model. The artificial intelligence (AI) model interpretation results were compared with those of the pathologists with senior, intermediate, and junior experience levels, using the mean absolute error (MAE) of the coccoid rate as an evaluation metric.\nFor the HPCF detection task, the YOLO v5 model was superior to the Faster R-CNN model (0.688 vs. 0.568, mean average precision, mAP); the optimized YOLO v5 model had a better performance (0.803 mAP). The MAE of the optimized YOLO v5 model (3.25 MAE) was superior to that of junior pathologists (4.14 MAE, p\u2009<\u20090.05), no worse than intermediate pathologists (3.40 MAE, p\u2009>\u20090.05), and equivalent to a senior pathologist (3.07 MAE, p\u2009>\u20090.05).\nHPCF identification using AI has the advantage of high accuracy and efficiency with the potential to assist or replace pathologists in clinical practice for HPCF identification.", "Case investigation and contact tracing (CICT) is an important tool for communicable disease control, both to proactively interrupt chains of transmission and to collect information for situational awareness. We run the first randomized trial of COVID-19 CICT to investigate the utility of manual (i.e., call-based) vs. automated (i.e., survey-based) CICT for pandemic surveillance.\nBetween December 15, 2021 and February 5, 2022, a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial was run in which Santa Clara County ZIP Codes progressively transitioned from manual to automated CICT. Eleven individual-level data fields on demographics and disease dynamics were observed for non-response. The data contains 106,522 positive cases across 29 ZIP Codes.\nAutomated CICT reduced overall collected information by 29 percentage points (SE\u00a0=\u00a00.08, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), as well as the response rate for individual fields. However, we find no evidence of differences in information loss by race or ethnicity.\nAutomated CICT can serve as a useful alternative to manual CICT, with no substantial evidence of skewing data along racial or ethnic lines, but manual CICT improves completeness of key data for monitoring epidemiologic patterns.\nThis research was supported in part by the Stanford Office of Community Engagement and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.", "Pharmaceutical analysis is a discipline based on chemical, physical, biological, and information technologies. At present, biotechnological analysis is a short branch in pharmaceutical analysis; however, bioanalysis is the basis and an important part of medicine. Biotechnological approaches can provide information on biological activity and even clinical efficacy and safety, which are important characteristics of drug quality. Because of their advantages in reflecting the overall biological effects or functions of drugs and providing visual and intuitive results, some biotechnological analysis methods have been gradually applied to pharmaceutical analysis from raw material to manufacturing and final product analysis, including DNA super-barcoding, DNA-based rapid detection, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, hyperspectral imaging combined with artificial intelligence, 3D biologically printed organoids, omics-based artificial intelligence, microfluidic chips, organ-on-a-chip, signal transduction pathway-related reporter gene assays, and the zebrafish thrombosis model. The applications of these emerging biotechniques in pharmaceutical analysis have been discussed in this review.", "Cardiovascular diseases have become the number one disease affecting human health in today's society. In the diagnosis of cardiac diseases, magnetic resonance image (MRI) technology is the most widely used one. However, in clinical diagnosis, the analysis of MRI relies on manual work, which is laborious and time-consuming, and also easily influenced by the subjective experience of doctors.\nIn this article, we propose an artificial intelligence-aided diagnosis system for cardiac MRI with image segmentation as the main component to assist in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. We first performed adequate pre-processing of MRI. The pre-processing steps include the detection of regions of interest of cardiac MRI data, as well as data normalization and data enhancement, and then we input the images after data pre-processing into the deep learning network module of ESA-Unet for the identification of the aorta in order to obtain preliminary segmentation results, and finally, the boundaries of the segmentation results are further optimized using conditional random fields. For ROI detection, we first use standard deviation filters for filtering to find regions in the heart cycle image sequence where pixel intensity varies strongly with time and then use Canny edge detection and Hough transform techniques to find the region of interest containing the heart. The ESA-Unet proposed in this article, moreover, is jointly designed with a self-attentive mechanism and multi-scale jump connection based on convolutional networks.\nThe experimental dataset used in this article is from the Department of CT/MRI at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Experiments compare other convolution-based methods, such as UNet, FCN, FPN, and PSPNet, and the results show that our model achieves the best results on Acc, Pr, ReCall, DSC, and IoU metrics. After comparative analysis, the experimental results show that the ESA-UNet network segmentation model designed in this article has higher accuracy, intuitiveness, and more application value than traditional image segmentation algorithms.\nWith the continuous application of nuclear magnetic resonance technology in clinical diagnosis, the method in this article is expected to become a tool that can effectively improve the efficiency of doctors' diagnoses.", "Imaging features of the lung in postmortem computed tomography (CT) scans have been reported in drowning cases. However, it is difficult for forensic pathologists with limited experience to distinguish subtle differences in CT images. In this study, artificial intelligence (AI) with deep learning capability was used to diagnose drowning in postmortem CT images, and its performance was evaluated. The samples consisted of high-resolution CT images of the chest of 153 drowned and 160 non-drowned bodies captured by an 8- or 64-row multislice CT system. The images were captured with an image slice thickness of 1.0 mm and spacing of 30 mm, and 28 images were typically captured. A modified AlexNet was used as the AI architecture. The output result was the drowning probability for each component image. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was analyzed, and the AUC value of 0.95 was obtained. This indicates that the proposed AI architecture is a useful and powerful complementary testing approach for diagnosing drowning in postmortem CT images. Notably, the accuracy was 81% (62/77) for cases in which resuscitation was performed, and 92% (216/236) for cases in which resuscitation was not attempted. Therefore, the proposed AI method should not be used to diagnose the cause of death when aggressive cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed. Additionally, because honeycomb lungs are likely to exhibit different morphologies, emphysema cases should also be treated with caution when the proposed AI method is used to diagnose drowning.", "Aptamers are short, single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotide sequences that can bind specific targets. The molecular weight of aptamers (<20\u00a0kDa) is lower than the renal filtration threshold (30\u223c50\u00a0kDa), resulting in very short half-lives in vivo, which limit their druggability. The development of long-lasting modification approaches for aptamers can help address the druggability bottleneck of aptamers. This review summarized two distinct kinds of long-lasting modification approaches for aptamers, including macromolecular modification and low-molecular-weight modification. Though it is a current approach to extend the half-life of aptamers, the macromolecular modification approach could limit the space for the dosage increases, thus causing potential compliance concerns due to large molecular weight. As for the other modification approach, the low-molecular-weight modification approach, which uses low molecular weight coupling agents (LMWCAs) to modify aptamers, could greatly increase the proportion of aptamer moiety. However, some LMWCAs could bind to other proteins, causing a decrease in the drug amounts in blood circulation. Given these issues, the outlook for the next generation of long-lasting modification approaches was proposed at the end, including improving the administration method to increase dosage for aptamer drugs modified by macromolecule and developing Artificial intelligence (AI)-based strategies for optimization of LMWCAs.", "In partnership with a Nehiyawak (Plains Cree) community of Maskwac\u00ees,central Alberta (Canada), we implemented an Indigenous-led intervention to provide experiential learning opportunities for perinatal health care providers (HCPs) and staff. Our objective was to capture the impact of participating in cultural safety learning opportunities on perceived self-awareness for HCPs and staff to provide enhanced culturally informed care.\nPerinatal HCPs and staff who work regularly with Indigenous women from our partnering community took part in a series of experiential learning activities designed by a Community Advisory Committee. We used an explanatory sequential mixed methods approach informed by community-based participatory research. We compared Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS) and Maskwac\u00ees-Specific Cultural Scale (MSCS) scores pre- and post-intervention using non-parametrical statistical analysis (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Post-intervention, we conducted a qualitative description study using semi-structured interviews. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis.\nA total of 17 participants completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires. Responses indicated a shift in perceived cultural and community knowledge and comfort levels, with positive gains in overall mean scores for both the CQS (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and MSCS (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Nine participants completed qualitative interviews. Overall, participants felt better equipped to provide more culturally informed care to their patients post-intervention.\nAn Indigenous-led experiential learning intervention was effective in enhancing overall perceived cultural awareness and preparedness to provide culturally informed care for perinatal HCPs and staff. This study provides evidence for fostering relationships between Indigenous communities and health systems toward enhanced perinatal care.", "UK Biobank participants do not have a high-quality measure of intelligence or polygenic scores (PGSs) of intelligence to simultaneously examine the genetic and neural underpinnings of intelligence. We created a standardized measure of general intelligence (g\u00a0factor) relative to the UK population and estimated its quality. After running a GWAS of g on UK Biobank participants with a g factor\u00a0of good quality and without neuroimaging data (N\u2009=\u2009187,288), we derived a g PGS for UK Biobank participants with neuroimaging data. For individuals with at least one cognitive test,\u00a0the g factor from eight cognitive tests (N\u2009=\u2009501,650) explained 29% of the variance in cognitive test performance. The PGS for British individuals with neuroimaging data (N\u2009=\u200927,174) explained 7.6% of the variance in g. We provided high-quality g factor estimates for most UK Biobank participants and g factor PGSs for UK Biobank participants with neuroimaging data.", "Rapid detection of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is crucial for assessing patients with neurological symptoms. Prioritising these urgent scans for reporting presents a challenge for radiologists. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a solution to enable radiologists to triage urgent scans and reduce reporting errors. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of an ICH-detection AI software and whether it benefits a high-volume trauma centre in terms of triage and reducing diagnostic errors. A peer review of head CT scans performed prior to the implementation of the AI was conducted to identify the department's current miss-rate. Once implemented, the AI software was validated using CT scans performed over one month, and was reviewed by a neuroradiologist. The turn-around-time was calculated as the time taken from scan completion to report finalisation. 2916 head CT scans and reports were reviewed as part of the audit. The AI software flagged 20 cases that were negative-by-report. Two of these were true-misses that had no follow-up imaging. Both patients were followed up and exhibited no long-term neurological sequelae. For ICH-positive scans, there was an increase in TAT in the total sample (35.6%), and a statistically insignificant decrease in TAT in the emergency (-\u20095.1%) and outpatient (-\u200914.2%) cohorts. The AI software was tested on a sample of real-world data from a high-volume Australian centre. The diagnostic accuracy was comparable to that reported in literature. The study demonstrated the institution's low miss-rate and short reporting time, therefore any improvements from the use of AI would be marginal and challenging to measure.", "Recently, IT technologies related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, and edge computing have been studied. Although there are many used clothing occurrences with 61 trillion worn of clothing consumption per year in Korea, it is not properly collected due to the efficiency of the used clothing collection system, and the collected used clothing is not properly recycled due to insufficient recycling system, lack of skilled labor force, and health problems of workers. To solve this problem, this study proposes a deep learning clothing classification system (DLCCS) using cloud and edge computing. The system proposed is to classify clothing image data input from camera terminals installed in various clothing classification sites in various regions into two classes, as well as nine classes, by deep learning using convolution neural network (CNN). And the classification results are stored in the cloud through edge computing. The edge computing enables the analysis of the data of the Internet of Things (IoT) device on the edge of the network before transmitting it to the cloud. The performance evaluation parameters that are considered for the proposed research study are transmission velocity and latency. Proposed system can efficiently improve the process and automation in the classification and processing of recycled clothing in various places. It is also expected that the waste of clothing resources and health problems of clothing classification workers will be improved.", "Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is required to identify patients suitable for disease-modifying medications and to improve access to non-pharmacological preventative interventions. Prior research shows detectable changes in speech in Alzheimer's dementia and its clinical precursors. The current study assesses whether a fully automated speech-based artificial intelligence system can detect cognitive impairment and amyloid beta positivity, which characterize early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Two hundred participants (age 54-85, mean 70.6; 114 female, 86 male) from sister studies in the UK (NCT04828122) and the USA (NCT04928976), completed the same assessments and were combined in the current analyses. Participants were recruited from prior clinical trials where amyloid beta status (97 amyloid positive, 103 amyloid negative, as established via PET or CSF test) and clinical diagnostic status was known (94 cognitively unimpaired, 106 with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease). The automatic story recall task was administered during supervised in-person or telemedicine assessments, where participants were asked to recall stories immediately and after a brief delay. An artificial intelligence text-pair evaluation model produced vector-based outputs from the original story text and recorded and transcribed participant recalls, quantifying differences between them. Vector-based representations were fed into logistic regression models, trained with tournament leave-pair-out cross-validation analysis to predict amyloid beta status (primary endpoint), mild cognitive impairment and amyloid beta status in diagnostic subgroups (secondary endpoints). Predictions were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the test result in comparison with reference standards (diagnostic and amyloid status). Simulation analysis evaluated two potential benefits of speech-based screening: (i) mild cognitive impairment screening in primary care compared with the Mini-Mental State Exam, and (ii) pre-screening prior to PET scanning when identifying an amyloid positive sample. Speech-based screening predicted amyloid beta positivity (area under the curve = 0.77) and mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease (area under the curve = 0.83) in the full sample, and predicted amyloid beta in subsamples (mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer's disease: area under the curve = 0.82; cognitively unimpaired: area under the curve = 0.71). Simulation analyses indicated that in primary care, speech-based screening could modestly improve detection of mild cognitive impairment (+8.5%), while reducing false positives (-59.1%). Furthermore, speech-based amyloid pre-screening was estimated to reduce the number of PET scans required by 35.3% and 35.5% in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and cognitively unimpaired individuals, respectively. Speech-based assessment offers accessible and scalable screening for mild cognitive impairment and amyloid beta positivity.", "Decisions in healthcare usually rely on the goodness and completeness of data that could be coupled with heuristics to improve the decision process itself. However, this is often an incomplete process. Structured interviews denominated Delphi surveys investigate experts' opinions and solve by consensus complex matters like those underlying surgical decision-making. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of study that combines computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. NLP can then be used as a valuable help in building a correct context in surgical data, contributing to the amelioration of surgical decision-making.\nWe applied NLP coupled with machine learning approaches to predict the context (words) owning high accuracy from the words nearest to Delphi surveys, used as input.\nThe proposed methodology has increased the usefulness of Delphi surveys favoring the extraction of keywords that can represent a specific clinical context. It permits the characterization of the clinical context suggesting words for the evaluation process of the data.", "The preliminary study was undertaken with the aim to assess the effect of fluoride content in water on the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of school children aged 12-13 years residing in areas that differ with respect to fluoride levels.\nThe IQ was measured using Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices in 90 children, who were life-long residents in three villages (30 children each) of similar population size but differing in the level of fluoride in drinking water. Urinary fluoride concentration was measured using the selective ion electrode technique. One-way ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis of the data. Results: Children who lived in locations with fluoride levels of 1.60, 6.70, or 2.80 parts per million in their drinking water had urinary fluoride concentrations of 1.60, 6.82, or 2.69 parts per million, and IQ scores of 16.77 + 8.24, 19.36 + 9.98, or 21.87 + 7.47, respectively.\nThe results indicated that there was a positive correlation between excess fluoride in drinking water and IQ.", "This study explored the current status of nursing informatics education in South Korea and developed a standardized curriculum for it.\nData were collected in two stages: first, an online survey conducted from December 2020 to February 2021 among 60 nursing schools to analyze the current status of nursing informatics education; and second, a two-round Delphi survey with 15 experts from March to April 2021 to determine the mean and standard deviation of the demand for each learning objective in nursing informatics education. A standardized curriculum proposal was developed based on the results of the two-round Delphi survey.\nNursing informatics was most commonly taught in the fourth year (34%), with two credits. The proportion of elective major subjects was high in undergraduate and graduate programs (77.4% and 78.6%, respectively), while the proportion of nursing informatics majors was low (21.4%). The curriculum developed included topics such as nursing information system-related concepts, definitions and components of healthcare information systems, electronic medical records, clinical decision support systems, mobile technology and health management, medical information standards, personal information protection and ethics, understanding of big data, use of information technology in evidence-based practice, use of information in community nursing, genome information usage, artificial intelligence clinical information systems, administrative management systems, and information technology nursing education.\nNursing informatics professors should receive ongoing training to obtain recent medical information. Further review and modification of the nursing informatics curriculum should be performed to ensure that it remains up-to-date with recent developments.", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses relentlessly from the preclinical to the dementia stage. The process begins decades before the diagnosis of dementia. Therefore, it is crucial to detect early manifestations to prevent cognitive decline. Recent advances in artificial intelligence help tackle the complex high-dimensional data encountered in clinical decision-making. In total, we recruited 206 subjects, including 69 cognitively unimpaired, 40 subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 34 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 63 AD dementia (ADD). We included 3 demographic, 1 clinical, 18 brain-image, and 3 plasma biomarker (A\u00df1-42, A\u00df1-40, and tau protein) features. We employed the linear discriminant analysis method for feature extraction to make data more distinguishable after dimension reduction. The sequential forward selection method was used for feature selection to identify the 12 best features for machine learning classifiers. We used both random forest and support vector machine as classifiers. The area under the receiver operative curve (AUROC) was close to 0.9 between diseased (combining ADD and MCI) and the controls. AUROC was higher than 0.85 between SCD and controls, 0.90 between MCI and SCD, and above 0.85 between ADD and MCI. We can differentiate between adjacent phases of the AD spectrum with blood biomarkers and brain MR images with the help of machine learning algorithms.", "Developments in artificial intelligence, particularly convolutional neural networks and deep learning, have the potential for problem solving that has previously confounded human intelligence. Accurate prediction of radiation dosimetry pre-treatment with scope to adjust dosing for optimal target and non-target tissue doses is consistent with striving for improved the outcomes of precision medicine. The combination of artificial intelligence and production of digital twins could provide an avenue for an individualised therapy doses and enhanced outcomes in theranostics. While there are barriers to overcome, the maturity of individual technologies (i.e. radiation dosimetry, artificial intelligence, theranostics and digital twins) places these approaches within reach.", "Subarachnoid hemorrhage from cerebral aneurysm rupture is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Early aneurysm identification, aided by automated systems, may improve patient outcomes. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in detecting cerebral aneurysms using CT, MRI or DSA was performed.\nMEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched until August 2021. Eligibility criteria included studies using fully automated algorithms to detect cerebral aneurysms using MRI, CT or DSA. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis: Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA), articles were assessed using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). Meta-analysis included a bivariate random-effect model to determine pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC).\nCRD42021278454.\n43 studies were included, and 41/43 (95%) were retrospective. 34/43 (79%) used AI as a standalone tool, while 9/43 (21%) used AI assisting a reader. 23/43 (53%) used deep learning. Most studies had high bias risk and applicability concerns, limiting conclusions. Six studies in the standalone AI meta-analysis gave (pooled) 91.2% (95% CI 82.2% to 95.8%) sensitivity; 16.5% (95% CI 9.4% to 27.1%) false-positive rate (1-specificity); 0.936 ROC-AUC. Five reader-assistive AI studies gave (pooled) 90.3% (95% CI 88.0% - 92.2%) sensitivity; 7.9% (95% CI 3.5% to 16.8%) false-positive rate; 0.910 ROC-AUC.\nAI has the potential to support clinicians in detecting cerebral aneurysms. Interpretation is limited due to high risk of bias and poor generalizability. Multicenter, prospective studies are required to assess AI in clinical practice.", "This study aimed to predict evaporation from dam reservoirs using artificial intelligence considering climate change. Mahabad Dam, near Lake Urmia, in northwestern Iran, is used to investigate the proposed approach. There are three parts to the study presented herein. In the first part, two machine learning models, namely group method of data handling (GMDH) and least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), were used to model the inflow to the dam reservoir. Temperature, precipitation, and inflow during the previous month from 1990 to 2017 were used as input data. In the second part, the evaporation from the dam reservoir was modeled using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and optimized ANFIS using Harris hawks optimization (HHO) and the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) optimization algorithms. The input parameters in this part were temperature, precipitation, inflow to the dam reservoir, along with evaporation from the dam reservoir in the previous month. In the third part, precipitation and temperature were predicted using the fifth report of IPCC based on RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios for the period 2020-2040. Out of 28 models presented in the fifth report, EC-ERATH and FIO-ESM had the greatest similarity with observational data of temperature and precipitation, respectively. The results of scatter plots and Taylor's diagram showed the higher performance of LS-SVR (root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 8.65, 4.69, and 0.96) compared to GMDH (RMSE, MAPE, and NSE of 11.65, 7.81, and 0.93) in modeling the inflow. Moreover, both hybrid modes (AOA-ANFIS and HHO-ANFIS) improved the performance of ANFIS in modeling the evaporation from the dam reservoir. The RMSE, MAPE, and NSE values for ANFIS were 0.56, 0.52, and 0.89, respectively, while these values for the AOA-ANFIS (RMSE, MAPE, and NSE of 0.31, 0.24, and 0.93) and HHO-ANFIS (RMSE, MAPE, and NSE of 0.20, 0.30, and 0.96) were improved remarkably. The impact of climate change reduced the inflow to the dam reservoir by about 0.45, 0.80, and 1.7 MCM in RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Also, the effect of climate change caused the evaporation from the dam reservoir to increase by about 0.2, 0.9, and 1 MCM in RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The findings of this study show that the correct management of dam reservoirs needs to consider the potential effects of climate change in the future. Moreover, the hybrid machine learning models used in this study can be used to predict the amount of evaporation in other reservoirs.", "To determine whether a risk prediction model using artificial intelligence (AI) to combine multiple data sources, including claims data, demographics, social\u00a0determinants of health (SDOH) data, and admission, discharge, and transfer (ADT) alerts, more accurately identifies high-cost members than traditional models.\nThe study used data from a Medicaid accountable care organization and included a population of\u00a061,850 members continuously enrolled between May 2018 and April 2019.\nRisk scores generated by 2 models were estimated for each member. One model, developed by Medical Home Network, used AI to analyze SDOH data, ADT activity, and claims and demographic characteristics, whereas the other model (Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System [CDPS]) relied only on demographic and claims information. To compare models, we calculated mean, median, and total spending for members with the highest 5% of AI risk scores and compared these with spending metrics for members with the highest 5% of CDPS scores. We also compared the number of members with the highest 5% of costs prospectively identified by each model as highest risk. We segmented the population by length of prior enrollment to control for varying levels of claims experience.\nThe AI model consistently identified a higher proportion of the highest-spending members. Members deemed highest risk by the AI model also had higher spending than members deemed highest risk by the CDPS\u00a0model.\nIdentification of high-cost members can be improved by using AI to combine traditional sources of data (eg, claims and demographic information) with nontraditional sources (eg, SDOH, admission alerts).", "Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are capable of automatically detecting contouring boundaries in medical images. However, the algorithms impact on clinical practice of cervical cancer are unclear. We aimed to develop an AI-assisted system for automatic contouring of the clinical target volume (CTV) and organs-at-risk (OARs) in cervical cancer radiotherapy and conduct clinical-based observations.\nWe first retrospectively collected data of 203 patients with cervical cancer from West China Hospital. The proposed method named as SegNet was developed and trained with different data groups. Quantitative metrics and clinical-based grading were used to evaluate differences between several groups of automatic contours. Then, 20 additional cases were conducted to compare the workload and quality of AI-assisted contours with manual delineation from scratch.\nFor automatic CTVs, the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) values of the SegNet trained with incorporating multi-group data achieved 0.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, which was statistically better than the DSC values of SegNet independently trained with the SegNet(A) (0.82\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04), SegNet(B) (0.82\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03) or SegNet(C) (0.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04). Moreover, the DSC values of the SegNet and UNet, respectively, 0.85 and 0.82 for the CTV (P\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.93 and 0.92 for the bladder (P\u2009=\u20090.44), 0.84 and 0.81 for the rectum (P\u2009=\u20090.02), 0.89 and 0.84 for the bowel bag (P\u2009<\u20090.001), 0.93 and 0.92 for the right femoral head (P\u2009=\u20090.17), and 0.92 and 0.91 for the left femoral head (P\u2009=\u20090.25). The clinical-based grading also showed that SegNet trained with multi-group data obtained better performance of 352/360 relative to it trained with the SegNet(A) (334/360), SegNet(B) (333/360) or SegNet(C) (320/360). The manual revision time for automatic CTVs (OARs not yet include) was 9.54\u2009\u00b1\u20092.42\u00a0min relative to fully manual delineation with 30.95\u2009\u00b1\u200915.24\u00a0min.\nThe proposed SegNet can improve the performance at automatic delineation for cervical cancer radiotherapy by incorporating multi-group data. It is clinically applicable that the AI-assisted system can shorten manual delineation time at no expense of quality.", "This study aimed to identify students' awareness of the use of a chatbot (A-uC), a type of artificial intelligence technology, for violence prevention among elementary school students.\nThe participants comprised 215 students in the fourth to sixth grades in Chuncheon, South Korea, and data were collected via a self-reported questionnaire.\nThe mean A-uC score was 3.43\u00b10.83 out of 5 points. The mean scores for the 4 sub-dimensions of the A-uC tool were 3.48\u00b10.80 for perceived value, 3.44\u00b10.98 for perceived usefulness, 3.63\u00b10.92 for perceived ease of use, and 3.15\u00b11.07 for intention to use. Significant differences were observed in A-uC scores (F=59.26, p<.001) according to the need for the use of chatbots in violence prevention education. The relationships between intention to use and the other A-uC sub-dimensions showed significant correlations with perceived value (r=.85, p<.001), perceived usefulness (r=.76, p<.001), and perceived ease of use (r=.64, p<.001).\nThe results of this study suggest that chatbots can be used in violence prevention education for elementary school students.", "Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common gastrointestinal dysfunction that significantly affects the quality of daily life, and health interventions are challenging to prevent the risk of GORD. In this study, we used Mendelian randomization framework to genetically determine the causal associations between multifaceted modifiable factors and the risk of GORD.\nSixty-six exposures with available instrumental variables (IVs) across 6 modifiable pathways were included in the univariable MR analysis (UVMR). Summary-level genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets for GORD were retrieved from the Neale Lab (GORD Neale , Ncases = 29975, Ncontrols = 390556) and FinnGen (GORD Finn , Ncases = 13141, Ncontrols = 89695). Using the METAL software, meta-analysis for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from GORD Neale and GORD Finn was conducted with an inverse variance weighted (IVW) fixed-effect model. Moreover, we leveraged partition around medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm to cluster genetic correlation subtypes, whose hub exposures were conditioned for multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses. P-values were adjusted with Bonferroni multiple comparisons.\nSignificant causal associations were identified between 26 exposures (15 risk exposures and 11 protective exposures) and the risk of GORD. Among them, 13 risk exposures [lifetime smoking, cigarette consumption, insomnia, short sleep, leisure sedentary behavior (TV watching), body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, whole body fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, waist circumference, hip circumference, major depressive disorder, and anxious feeling], and 10 protective exposures (leisure sedentary behavior (computer use), sitting height, hand grip strength (left and right), birth weight, life satisfaction, positive affect, income, educational attainment, and intelligence) showed novel significant causal associations with the risk of GORD. Moreover, 13 exposures still demonstrated independent associations with the risk of GORD following MVMR analyses conditioned for hub exposures (educational attainment, smoking initiation and BMI). In addition, 12 exposures showed suggestive causal associations with the risk of GORD.\nThis study systematically elucidated the modifiable factors causally associated with the risk of GORD from multifaceted perspectives, which provided implications for prevention and treatment of GORD.", "To evaluate the application value of a generally trained artificial intelligence (AI) automatic diagnosis system in the malignancy diagnosis of follicular-patterned thyroid lesions (FPTL), including follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), adenomatoid hyperplasia nodule (AHN) and follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA) and compare the diagnostic performance with radiologists of different experience levels.\nWe retrospectively reviewed 607 patients with 699 thyroid nodules that included 168 malignant nodules by using postoperative pathology as the gold standard, and compared the diagnostic performances of three radiologists (one junior, two senior) and that of AI automatic diagnosis system in malignancy diagnosis of FPTL in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, respectively. Pairwise t-test was used to evaluate the statistically significant difference.\nThe accuracy of the AI system in malignancy diagnosis was 0.71, which was higher than the best radiologist in this study by a margin of 0.09 with a p-value of 2.08\u00d710-5. Two radiologists had higher sensitivity (0.84 and 0.78) than that of the AI system (0.69) at the cost of having much lower specificity (0.35, 0.57 versus 0.71). One senior radiologist showed balanced sensitivity and specificity (0.62 and 0.54) but both were lower than that of the AI system.\nThe generally trained AI automatic diagnosis system can potentially assist radiologists for distinguishing FTC from other FPTL cases that share poorly distinguishable ultrasonographical features.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine has grown rapidly, yet few algorithms have been deployed. It is not the problem with the AI itself but with the way functions and results are communicated. Regulatory science provides the appropriate language and solutions to this problem for three reasons: First, there is value in the intentionally interdisciplinary regulatory language. Second, regulatory concepts are important for AI researchers because these concepts enable tackling of risk and safety concerns as well as understanding of recently proposed regulations in the US and Europe. Third, regulatory science is a scientific discipline that evaluates and challenges current regulation\u2014aiming for evidence-based improvements. Knowledge of the regulatory language, concepts, and science should be regarded a core competency for communicating medical innovation. Regulatory grade communication will be the key to bringing medical AI from hype to standard of care. Foregoing the possible benefits of regulatory science as a unifying force for the realization of medical AI is a missed opportunity.", "Artificial intelligence computing adapted from biology is a suitable platform for the development of intelligent machines by imitating the functional mechanisms of the nervous system in creating high-level activities such as learning, decision making and cognition in today's systems. Here, the concentration is on improvement the cognitive potential of artificial intelligence network with a bio-inspired structure. In this regard, four spiking pattern recognition platforms for recognizing digits and letters of EMNIST, patterns of YALE, and ORL datasets are proposed. All networks are developed based on a similar structure in the input image coding, model of neurons (pyramidal neurons and interneurons) and synapses (excitatory AMPA and inhibitory GABA currents), and learning procedure. Networks 1-4 are trained on Digits, Letters, faces of YALE and ORL, respectively, with the proposed un-supervised, spatial-temporal, and sparse spike-based learning mechanism based on the biological observation of the brain learning. When the networks have reached the highest recognition accuracy in the relevant patterns, the main goal of the article, which is to achieve high-performance pattern recognition system with higher cognitive ability, is followed. The pattern recognition network that is able to detect the combination of multiple patterns which called intertwined patterns has not been discussed yet. Therefore, by integrating four trained spiking pattern recognition platforms in one system configuration, we are able to recognize intertwined patterns. These results are presented for the first time and could be the pioneer of a new generation of pattern recognition networks with a significant ability in smart machines.", "Training machines to understand natural language and interact with humans is one of the major goals of artificial intelligence. Recent years have witnessed an evolution from matching networks to pretrained language models (PrLMs). In contrast to the plain-text modeling as the focus of the PrLMs, dialog texts involve multiple speakers and reflect special characteristics, such as topic transitions and structure dependencies, between distant utterances. However, the related PrLM models commonly represent dialogs sequentially by processing the pairwise dialog history as a whole. Thus, the hierarchical information on either utterance interrelation or speaker roles coupled in such representations is not well addressed. In this work, we propose compositional learning for holistic interaction across the utterances beyond the sequential contextualization from PrLMs, in order to capture the utterance-aware and speaker-aware representations entailed in a dialog history. We decouple the contextualized word representations by masking mechanisms in transformer-based PrLM, making each word only focus on the words in the current utterance, other utterances, and two speaker roles (i.e., utterances of the sender and utterances of the receiver), respectively. In addition, we employ domain-adaptive training strategies to help the model adapt to the dialog domains. Experimental results show that our method substantially boosts the strong PrLM baselines in four public benchmark datasets, achieving new state-of-the-art performance over previous methods.", "Strengthening environmental regulation and adhering to the green as well as sustainable development of China's manufacturing industry has become an inevitable trend. Technological innovation leads to industrial transformation, and artificial intelligence becomes a new driving force for core competitiveness and value chain upgrading. Is there a link between environmental regulation, artificial intelligence, and the jump in global value chains? Does AI have a mediating effect? This paper draws the following conclusions through panel estimation: environmental regulation plays a positive role in global value chains, and artificial intelligence has improved the level of global value chains as well. Further analysis of the mediation effect of artificial intelligence finds that artificial intelligence replaces low-end labor, reduces labor costs for enterprises, and promotes the leap of the global value chain. The strengthening of environmental regulation has greatly improved the total factor productivity of enterprises, artificial intelligence has significantly improved production efficiency, and total factor productivity has shown a positive influence on the global value chain as well.", "Mathematical models of human cardiovascular and respiratory systems provide a viable alternative to generate synthetic data to train artificial intelligence (AI) clinical decision-support systems and assess closed-loop control technologies, for military medical applications. However, existing models are either complex, standalone systems that lack the interface to other applications or fail to capture the essential features of the physiological responses to the major causes of battlefield trauma (i.e., hemorrhage and airway compromise). To address these limitations, we developed the cardio-respiratory (CR) model by expanding and integrating two previously published models of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. We compared the vital signs predicted by the CR model with those from three models, using experimental data from 27 subjects in five studies, involving hemorrhage, fluid resuscitation, and respiratory perturbations. Overall, the CR model yielded relatively small root mean square errors (RMSEs) for mean arterial pressure (MAP; 20.88\u2009mm Hg), end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2 ; 3.50\u2009mm Hg), O2 saturation (SpO2 ; 3.40%), and arterial O2 pressure (PaO2 ; 10.06\u2009mm Hg), but a relatively large RMSE for heart rate (HR; 70.23 beats/min). In addition, the RMSEs for the CR model were 3% to 10% smaller than the three other models for HR, 11% to 15% for ETCO2 , 0% to 33% for SpO2 , and 10% to 64% for PaO2 , while they were similar for MAP. In conclusion, the CR model balances simplicity and accuracy, while qualitatively and quantitatively capturing human physiological responses to battlefield trauma, supporting its use to train and assess emerging AI and control systems.", "The relevance of social cognition assessment has been formally described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5. However, social cognition tools evaluating different socio-cognitive components for Italian-speaking populations are lacking. The Edinburgh Social Cognition Test (ESCoT) is a new social cognition measure that uses animations of everyday social interactions to assess (i) cognitive theory of mind, (ii) affective theory of mind, (iii) interpersonal social norm understanding, and (iv) intrapersonal social norm understanding. Previous studies have shown that the ESCoT is a sensitive measure of social cognition in healthy and clinical populations in the United Kingdom. This work aimed to adapt and validate the ESCoT in an Italian population of healthy adults. A translation-back-translation procedure was followed to create and refine the Italian version. Then, 94 healthy adults (47 females, mean age \u200935\u2009\u00b1\u200915.9) completed the ESCoT, a battery of conventional social cognition tests (Yoni; Reading the Mind in the Eyes Strange Stories, and Social Norm Questionnaire, SNQ) and measures of intelligence and executive functions. Reliability, convergent validity, and predictors of performance on the ESCoT were examined. Results demonstrated good reliability of the ESCoT and an association between the ESCoT scores and some traditional social cognition tests (Yoni cognitive subscale, SNQ). Hierarchical regression results showed that the ESCoT total score was associated with age. Also, the ESCoT subscore (intrapersonal social norm understanding) was associated with education. These findings support the ESCoT as a valid tool testing social norm understanding, a reliable measure of social cognition for an adult Italian population, and provides further evidence that the ESCoT is sensitive to age- and education-related changes in social cognition, and it is a task not affected by general cognitive functioning.", "Ovarian Cancer (OC) is the deadliest gynecology malignancy, whose high recurrence rate in OC patients is a challenging object. Therefore, having deep insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms of OC recurrence can improve the target therapeutic procedures. This study aimed to discover crucial miRNAs for the detection of tumor recurrence in OC by artificial intelligence approaches.\nThrough the ANOVA feature selection method, we selected 100 candidate miRNAs among 588 miRNAs. For their classification, a deep-learning model was employed to validate the significance of the candidate miRNAs. The accuracy, F1-score (high-risk), and AUC-ROC of classification test data based on the 100 miRNAs were 73%, 0.81, and 0.65, respectively. Association rule mining was used to discover hidden relations among the selected miRNAs.\nFive miRNAs, including miR-1914, miR-203, miR-135a-2, miR-149, and miR-9-1, were identified as the most frequent items among high-risk association rules. The identified miRNAs may target genes/proteins involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), resistance to therapy, and cancer stem cells; being responsible for the heterogeneity and plasticity of the tumor. Our conclusion presents mir-1914 as the significant candidate miRNA and the most frequent item. Current knowledge indicates that the dysregulated miR-1914 may function as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in the development of cancer.\nThese candidate miRNAs can be considered a powerful tool in the diagnosis of OC recurrence. We hypothesize that mir-1914 might open a new line of research in the realm of managing the recurrence of OC and could be a significant factor in triggering OC recurrence.", "This review focuses on three key noninvasive cardiac imaging modalities-cardiac CT angiography (CTA), MRI, and PET/CT-and summarizes key publications in 2021 relevant to radiologists in clinical practice. Although this review focuses primarily on articles published in Radiology, important studies from other major journals are included to highlight \"must-know\" articles in the field of cardiovascular imaging. Cardiac CTA has been established as the first-line test for patients with stable chest pain and no known coronary artery disease, and its value remains central to the assessment of surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Artificial intelligence continues to evolve in a number of applications in cardiovascular disease. In cardiac MRI studies, 2021 has seen an emphasis on nonischemic cardiomyopathies, valvular heart disease, and COVID-19 disease cardiac manifestations and the authors highlight the key articles on these topics. A section featuring the increasing role of cardiac PET/CT in the assessment of cardiac sarcoidosis and prosthetic valves is also provided.", "Hypomelanosis of Ito (HI) is a neurocutaneous disorder associated with central nervous system abnormalities, including speech delay and intellectual disability. The long term neuropsychological and social characteristics of these children are unknown. Neuropsychological observations and parental reports were obtained yearly on a child with HI from ages 7 to 18\u00a0years. Serial measures of intelligence revealed stable verbal and perceptual reasoning scores with later improvements in working memory and processing speed performance. Speech articulation improved at age 12, as did the speed of right-hand finger tapping. Improved social integration occurred, but anxiety persisted throughout this developmental period.", "Polygenicity and genetic heterogeneity pose great challenges for studying psychiatric conditions. Genetically informed approaches have been implemented in neuroimaging studies to address this issue. However, the effects on functional connectivity of rare and common genetic risks for psychiatric disorders are largely unknown. Our objectives were to estimate and compare the effect sizes on brain connectivity of psychiatric genomic risk factors with various levels of complexity: oligogenic copy number variants (CNVs), multigenic CNVs, and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) as well as idiopathic psychiatric conditions and traits.\nResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were processed using the same pipeline across 9 datasets. Twenty-nine connectome-wide association studies were performed to characterize the effects of 15 CNVs (1003 carriers), 7 PRSs, 4 idiopathic psychiatric conditions (1022 individuals with autism, schizophrenia, bipolar conditions, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), and 2 traits (31,424 unaffected control subjects).\nEffect sizes on connectivity were largest for psychiatric CNVs (estimates: 0.2-0.65 z score), followed by psychiatric conditions (0.15-0.42), neuroticism and fluid intelligence (0.02-0.03), and PRSs (0.01-0.02). Effect sizes of CNVs on connectivity were correlated to their effects on cognition and risk for disease (r\u00a0= 0.9, p\u00a0= 5.93\u00a0\u00d7 10-6). However, effect sizes of CNVs adjusted for the number of genes significantly decreased from small oligogenic to large multigenic CNVs (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.88, p\u00a0= 8.78\u00a0\u00d7 10-6). PRSs had disproportionately low effect sizes on connectivity compared with CNVs conferring similar risk for disease.\nHeterogeneity and polygenicity affect our ability to detect brain connectivity alterations underlying psychiatric manifestations.", "The field of pediatric critical care has been hampered in the era of precision medicine by our inability to accurately define and subclassify disease phenotypes. This has been caused by heterogeneity across age groups that further challenges the ability to perform randomized controlled trials in pediatrics. One approach to overcome these inherent challenges include the use of machine learning algorithms that can assist in generating more meaningful interpretations from clinical data. This review summarizes machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques that are currently in use for clinical data modeling with relevance to pediatric critical care. Focus has been placed on the differences between techniques and the role of each in the clinical arena. The various forms of clinical decision support that utilize machine learning are also described. We review the applications and limitations of machine learning techniques to empower clinicians to make informed decisions at the bedside. IMPACT: Critical care units generate large amounts of under-utilized data that can be processed through artificial intelligence. This review summarizes the machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques currently being used to process clinical data. The review highlights the applications and limitations of these techniques within a clinical context to aid providers in making more informed decisions at the bedside.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly deep learning, have made significant strides in image recognition and classification, providing remarkable diagnostic accuracy to various diseases. This domain of AI has been the focus of many research papers as it directly relates to the roles and responsibilities of a radiologist. However, discussions on the impact of such technology on the radiography profession are often overlooked. To address this gap in the literature, this paper aims to address the application of AI in radiography and how AI's rapid emergence into healthcare is impacting not only standard radiographic protocols but the role of the radiographic technologist as well.\nA review of the literature on AI and radiography was performed, using databases within PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Video presentations from YouTube were also utilized to weigh the varying opinions of world leaders at the fore of artificial intelligence.\nAI can augment routine standard radiographic protocols. It can automatically ensure optimal patient positioning within the gantry as well as automate image processing. As AI technologies continue to emerge in diagnostic imaging, practicing radiologic technologists are urged to achieve threshold computational and technical literacy to operate AI-driven imaging technology.\nThere are many applications of AI in radiography including acquisition and image processing. In the near future, it will be important to supply the demand for radiographers skilled in AI-driven technologies.", "The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 has resulted in destruction of healthcare infrastructure and triggered the largest wave of internally displaced populations and refugees since World War Two. Conflicts in transitioned countries such as Ukraine create new non-communicable disease (NCD) challenges, especially for cancer care for refugees and humanitarian assistance in host countries. In the early days, rapid attempts were made to model possible impacts.\nBy evaluating open source intelligence used in the first three months of the conflict through snowball search methods, we aimed to address: (i) burden of cancer in Ukrainian population, specifically considering translating to the refugees population, and its cancer care capacity; ii) baseline capacity/strengths of cancer systems in initial host countries. Moreover, using a baseline scenario based on crude cancer incidence in Ukraine, and considering data from UNHCR, we estimated how cancer cases would be distributed across host countries. Finally, a surveillance assessment instrument was created, intersecting health system's capacity and influx of internally displaced populations and refugees.\nThe total new cancer patients per month in pre-conflict Ukraine was estimated as 13,106, of which <\u00a01 % are paediatric cases. The estimated cancer cases in the refugee population (combining prevalent and incident), assuming 7.5 million refugees by July 2022 and a female:male ratio of 9:1, was 33,121 individuals (Poland: 19284; Hungary: 3484; Moldova: 2651; Slovakia: 2421; Romania: 5281). According to our assessments, Poland is the only neighbouring country classified as green/yellow for cancer capacity, i.e. sufficient ablility to absorb additional burden into national health system; Slovakia we graded as yellow, Hungary and Romania as yellow/red and Moldova as red.", "Some individuals can flexibly adapt to life's changing demands while others, in particular those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), find it challenging. The origin of early individual differences in cognitive abilities, the putative tools with which to navigate novel information in life, including in infants later diagnosed with ASD remains unexplored. Moreover, the role of intelligence quotient (IQ) vis-\u00e0-vis core features of autism remains debated. We systematically investigate the contribution of early IQ in future autism outcomes in an extremely large, population-based study of 8000 newborns, infants, and toddlers from the US between 2 and 68\u2009months with over 15,000 cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments, and for whom autism outcomes are ascertained or ruled out by about 2-4\u2009years. This population is representative of subjects involved in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded research, mainly on atypical development, in the US. Analyses using predetermined age bins showed that IQ scores are consistently lower in ASD relative to typically developing (TD) children at all ages (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and IQ significantly correlates with social, non-social, and total Calibrated Severity Scores (CSS) on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) (p<0.01). Lower IQ is associated with greater autistic impairments. Note, verbal IQ (VIQ) is no better than the full-scale IQ to predict ASD cases. These findings raise new, compelling questions about potential atypical brain circuitry affecting performance in both verbal and nonverbal abilities and preceding an ASD diagnosis. This study is the first to establish prospectively that low early IQ is a major feature of ASD in early childhood. LAY SUMMARY: The role of IQ scores in autism remains debated. We systematically investigate the contribution of early IQ in an extremely large study of 8,000 children between 2 and 68 months with autism outcomes by about 2-4\u2009years. We show that IQ scores are consistently lower in ASD relative to TD children. This study is the first to establish prospectively that low early IQ is a predictor for ASD diagnosis in early childhood.", "The COVID-19 had negative effects on individuals and nations worldwide. However, based on literature suggesting that crises can trigger growth, we propose that it may have also triggered individuals' character strengths development, especially among those having experienced moderate levels of difficulty during the pandemic and having received social support. The participants' (N\u2009=\u20091700) 24 character strengths were assessed twice: before and during COVID-19. At the second assessment, participants also reported the level of impact COVID-19 had on their lives, and their perceived social support. MANOVA analysis revealed a general increase in character strengths, with significant - but mainly negligible or small - increases in 17 strengths: appreciation of beauty and excellence, bravery, prudence, creativity, curiosity, fairness, gratitude, honesty, hope, judgment, kindness, leadership, perspective, self-regulation, social intelligence, spirituality, and zest. Across the 24 strengths, the reported level of COVID-19's impact (i.e., low, moderate, or high) was not associated with different changes during the pandemic. Univariate analyses showed that such changes were significant only in curiosity, forgiveness and kindness. The multivariate effect of social support on changes in character strengths was significant. Specifically, it enhanced the increase in love, prudence, curiosity, forgiveness, gratitude, honesty, hope, judgment, leadership, humility and zest during COVID-19, although the interactions effect sizes were small. The results suggest that, in the time frame examined in this study, character development processes triggered by COVID-19 were evident, yet specific changes in strengths were relatively mild. Some of these processes may have been enhanced by social support.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10902-022-00575-6.", "Learning to disentangle and represent factors of variation in data is an important problem in artificial intelligence. While many advances have been made to learn these representations, it is still unclear how to quantify disentanglement. While several metrics exist, little is known on their implicit assumptions, what they truly measure, and their limits. In consequence, it is difficult to interpret results when comparing different representations. In this work, we survey supervised disentanglement metrics and thoroughly analyze them. We propose a new taxonomy in which all metrics fall into one of the three families: intervention-based, predictor-based, and information-based. We conduct extensive experiments in which we isolate properties of disentangled representations, allowing stratified comparison along several axes. From our experiment results and analysis, we provide insights on relations between disentangled representation properties. Finally, we share guidelines on how to measure disentanglement.", "Novel design of proteins to target receptors for treatment or tissue augmentation has come to the fore owing to advancements in computing power, modeling frameworks, and translational successes. Shorter proteins, or peptides, can offer combinatorial synergies with dendrimer, polymer, or other peptide carriers for enhanced local signaling, which larger proteins may sterically hinder. Here, we present a generalized method for designing a novel peptide. We first show how to create a script protocol that can be used to iteratively optimize and screen novel peptide sequences for binding a target protein. We present a step-by-step introduction to utilizing file repositories, data bases, and the Rosetta software suite. RosettaScripts, an .xml interface that allows for sequential functions to be performed, is used to order the functions for repeatable performance. These strategies may lead to more groups venturing into computational design, which may result in synergies from artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) to phage display and screening. Importantly, the beginner is expected to be able to design their first peptide ligand and begin their journey in peptide drug discovery. Generally, these peptides potentially could be used to interact with any enzyme or receptor, for example, in the study of chemokines and their interactions with glycosoaminoglycans and their receptors.", "To develop a free, vendor-neutral software suite, the American College of Radiology (ACR) Connect, which serves as a platform for democratizing artificial intelligence (AI) for all individuals and institutions.\nAmong its core capabilities, ACR Connect provides educational resources; tools for dataset annotation; model building and evaluation; and an interface for collaboration and federated learning across institutions without the need to move data off hospital premises.\nThe AI-LAB application within ACR Connect allows users to investigate AI models using their own local data while maintaining data security. The software enables non-technical users to participate in the evaluation and training of AI models as part of a larger, collaborative network.\nAdvancements in AI have transformed automated quantitative analysis for medical imaging. Despite the significant progress in research, AI is currently underutilized in current clinical workflows. The success of AI model development depends critically on the synergy between physicians who can drive clinical direction, data scientists who can design effective algorithms, and the availability of high-quality datasets. ACR Connect and AI-LAB provide a way to perform external validation as well as collaborative, distributed training.\nIn order to create a collaborative AI ecosystem across clinical and technical domains, the ACR developed a platform that enables non-technical users to participate in education and model development.", "The global burden of influenza is substantial. It is a major disease that causes annual epidemics and occasionally, pandemics. Given that influenza primarily infects the upper respiratory system, it may be possible to diagnose influenza infection by applying deep learning to pharyngeal images.\nWe aimed to develop a deep learning model to diagnose influenza infection using pharyngeal images and clinical information.\nWe recruited patients who visited clinics and hospitals because of influenza-like symptoms. In the training stage, we developed a diagnostic prediction artificial intelligence (AI) model based on deep learning to predict polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed influenza from pharyngeal images and clinical information. In the validation stage, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the AI model. In additional analysis, we compared the diagnostic performance of the AI model with that of 3 physicians and interpreted the AI model using importance heat maps.\nWe enrolled a total of 7831 patients at 64 hospitals between November 1, 2019, and January 21, 2020, in the training stage and 659 patients (including 196 patients with PCR-confirmed influenza) at 11 hospitals between January 25, 2020, and March 13, 2020, in the validation stage. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the AI model was 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.93), and its sensitivity and specificity were 76% (70%-82%) and 88% (85%-91%), respectively, outperforming 3 physicians. In the importance heat maps, the AI model often focused on follicles on the posterior pharyngeal wall.\nWe developed the first AI model that can accurately diagnose influenza from pharyngeal images, which has the potential to help physicians to make a timely diagnosis.", "As the challenges of food insecurity and population explosion become more pressing, there is a dire need to revamp the existing breeding and animal management systems. This can be achieved by the introduction of technology for efficiency and the improvement of the genetic merit of animals. A fundamental requirement for animal breeding is the availability of accurate and reliable pedigreed data and tools facilitating sophisticated computations. Keeping this in view, Smart Sheep Breeder (SSB) was developed using the waterfall methodology and multiple programming languages. It is a multi-use online artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0based and internet of things (IoT) compatible decision support system (DSS). It is capable of automatic performance recording, farm data management, data mining, biometrical analysis, e-governance, and decision-making in sheep farms. A centralized database was also developed capable of ranking sheep across multiple farms based on genetic merit and effective dissemination of germplasm. The system in India is available as a web-based tool and android application which facilitates performance recording and generates customized reports on various aspects of sheep production. SSB uses artificial intelligence and biometrical genetic algorithms to calculate breeding values, and inbreeding coefficients, construct selection indices and generate pedigree, and history sheets as well as more than 40 types of custom-tailored animal and farm reports and graphs. The algorithms used were validated using on farms using farm data and also by comparison with established methods and software. Smart Sheep Breeder could thus prove to be indispensable for the present farming systems which could be used by sheep farm managers and breeders across India.", "Walnut oil is extracted from walnut kernels (Juglans regia Linne) or iron walnut kernels (Juhlans sigillata Dode). The percentage of oil in walnuts is 52%-70%. The main constituents in oil are fatty acids, phenols, sterols, squalene, melatonin, vitamins, and minerals. Many extraction methods such as supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, maceration, modified \"bligh and dyer extraction,\" aqueous enzymatic extraction, ultrasonic extraction, soxhlet extraction, and cold-press extraction methods are reported in the literature. Walnut oil showed anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, antidiabetic, and antihyperlipidemic activities. The reported data in the literature suggest that walnut oil has many health benefits. This review summarizes the extraction methods, bioactive constituents, health benefits, and pharmacological actions of walnut oil. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Walnut oil is a natural vegetable oil of significant importance due to their nutritional, and intelligence-boosting benefits. Several factors, including the processing parameters and the phytochemical profile, affect walnut oil products' flavor and color. In addition, storage environment of walnut oil can also affect walnut oil quality. Apart from the predominant ingredient fatty acids, the chemical composition of walnut oil comprises phenols, sterols, squalene, melatonin, vitamins, and minerals. These bioactive compounds are of potential value owing to their health-promoting benefits, including antioxidant, antitumor, and cholesterol-lowering effects. Many chemical constituents were isolated from walnut oil; however, all the compounds are not explored for their possible medicinal value. Thus, clinical studies, exploration of the therapeutic potential and the molecular mechanisms of all the compounds, and development of convenient dosage forms either for therapeutic or functional food purposes are warranted.", "This study aims to describe and assess the current stage of the artificial intelligence (AI) technology integration in preventive orthopaedics of the knee and hip joints.\nThe study was conducted in strict compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Literature databases were searched for articles describing the development and validation of AI models aimed at diagnosing knee or hip joint pathologies or predicting their development or course in patients. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) and QUADAS-AI tools.\n56 articles were found that meet all the inclusion criteria. We identified two problems that block the full integration of AI into the routine of an orthopaedic physician. The first of them is related to the insufficient amount, variety and quality of data for training, and validation and testing of AI models. The second problem is the rarity of rational evaluation of models, which is why their real quality cannot always be evaluated.\nThe vastness and relevance of the studied topic are beyond doubt. Qualitative and optimally validated models exist in all four scopes considered. Additional optimization and confirmation of the models' quality on various datasets are the last technical stumbling blocks for creating usable software and integrating them into the routine of an orthopaedic physician.", "Artificial intelligence has been developed to be able to solve difficult problems that involve huge amounts of data and that require rapid decision-making in most branches of science and business. Machine learning is one of the most prominent areas of artificial intelligence, which has been used heavily in the last two decades in the field of network security, especially in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Pattern recognition is a machine learning method applied in medical applications, image processing, and video processing. In this article, two layers' IDS is proposed. The first layer classifies the network connection according to the used service. Then, a minimum number of features that optimize the detection accuracy of malicious activities on that service are identified. Using those features, the second layer classifies each network connection as an attack or normal activity based on the pattern recognition method. In the training phase, two multivariate normal statistical models are created: the normal behavior model and the attack behavior model. In the testing and running phases, a maximum likelihood estimation function is used to classify a network connection into attack or normal activity using the two multivariate normal statistical models. The experimental results prove that the proposed IDS has superiority over related IDSs for network intrusion detection. Using only four features, it successfully achieves DR of 97.5%, 0.001 FAR, MCC 95.7%, and 99.8% overall accuracy.", "To elaborate on the development and characteristics of trauma orthopedic robots and their real curative effect in a clinical application through the collection and analysis of relevant literature and reported clinical results.\nWe conducted the Embase, ScienceDirect, Pubmed, Medline, Wanfang, CNKI, and VIP search of the literature on robotic-assisted surgery in trauma orthopedics in China. We combined search terms with \"robotic surgery/artificial intelligence surgery/navigation surgery,\" \"trauma/trauma orthopedics,\" and \"China/Chinese.\" The exclusion criteria were: (1) articles in languages other than English or Chinese, (2) articles focused on other topics other than robotic-assisted surgery in trauma orthopedics of China, (3) article types were not clinical studies (reviews, basic research, etc.), and (4) articles were not included in the Chinese core journals or science citation index. Authors, type of surgery, robot type, and clinical research results were recorded and analyzed.\nThere were three categories of surgical robots in the clinical application of trauma orthopedics\u00a0(TiRobot, electromagnetic navigation surgical robots, and small medical robots developed by Beijing Jishuitan Hospital). In terms of blood loss, the fluoroscopy time, and fluoroscopy frequency, most studies found that the robot group was significantly better than the traditional group.\nRobot-assisted surgery has obvious advantages in accuracy, stability, and reducing intraoperative radiation exposure, but there is no final conclusion about functional recovery.", "Prior research has found that various job candidate characteristics can influence hiring decisions. The current work used experimental methods to test how a novel, appearance-based cue known as a facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) can bias hiring preferences. A first study provides evidence for our initial hypothesis: people believed high fWHR candidates would be a better fit for blue-collar jobs compared with low fWHR candidates, who were in turn favoured for white-collar jobs. A second study replicates this initial finding and extends it by demonstrating that the effect of fWHR-derived trait inferences of strength and intelligence on hireability predictably varies by job type. Finally, in a third study, we find that this bias reverses when traditional stereotypes of blue-collar and white-collar jobs requiring physicality and intellect are subverted, finding that perceptions of the fit between face type and presumed job requirements matter most for hiring preferences. Together, these findings demonstrate how a seemingly subtle appearance-based cue can have robust implications for hiring.", "We have recently shown that histological phenotypes focusing on clear and eosinophilic cytoplasm in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) correlated with prognosis and the response to angiogenesis inhibition and checkpoint blockade. This study aims to objectively show the diagnostic utility of clear or eosinophilic phenotypes of ccRCC by developing an artificial intelligence (AI) model using the TCGA-ccRCC dataset and to demonstrate if the clear or eosinophilic predicted phenotypes correlate with pathological factors and gene signatures associated with angiogenesis and cancer immunity. Before the development of the AI model, histological evaluation using hematoxylin and eosin whole-slide images of the TCGA-ccRCC cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0435) was performed by a urologic pathologist. The AI model was developed as follows. First, the highest-grade area on each whole slide image was captured for image processing. Second, the selected regions were cropped into tiles. Third, the AI model was trained using transfer learning on a deep convolutional neural network, and clear or eosinophilic predictions were scaled as AI scores. Next, we verified the AI model using a validation cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a095). Finally, we evaluated the accuracy of the prognostic predictions of the AI model and revealed that the AI model detected clear and eosinophilic phenotypes with high accuracy. The AI model stratified the patients' outcomes, and the predicted eosinophilic phenotypes correlated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics and high immune-related gene signatures. In conclusion, the AI-based histologic subclassification accurately predicted clear or eosinophilic phenotypes of ccRCC, allowing for consistently reproducible stratification for prognostic and therapeutic stratification.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) indicates the application of machines to imitate intelligent behaviors for solving complex tasks with minimal human intervention, including machine learning and deep learning. The use of AI in medicine improves health-care systems in multiple areas such as diagnostic confirmation, risk stratification, analysis, prognosis prediction, treatment surveillance, and virtual health support, which has considerable potential to revolutionize and reshape medicine. In terms of immunotherapy, AI has been applied to unlock underlying immune signatures to associate with responses to immunotherapy indirectly as well as predict responses to immunotherapy responses directly. The AI-based analysis of high-throughput sequences and medical images can provide useful information for management of cancer immunotherapy considering the excellent abilities in selecting appropriate subjects, improving therapeutic regimens, and predicting individualized prognosis. In present review, we aim to evaluate a broad framework about AI-based computational approaches for prediction of response to cancer immunotherapy on both indirect and direct manners. Furthermore, we summarize our perspectives about challenges and opportunities of further AI applications on cancer immunotherapy relating to clinical practicability.", "Stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is an emerging non-invasive imaging technique for the assessment of known or suspected ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Stress CMR provides information on myocardial perfusion, wall motion, ventricular dimensions and volumes, as well as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) scar imaging in a single test without ionising radiation. Data from numerous multicentre randomised studies show high diagnostic and prognostic utility, its efficacy as a gatekeeper to invasive coronary angiography and use for guiding coronary revascularisation decisions. Stress CMR is cost-effective across multiple healthcare settings, yet its uptake and usage varies worldwide and is an underutilised technology. New developments include rapid acquisition protocols, automated quantification of perfusion and myocardial blood flow, and artificial intelligence-aided automated analysis and reporting. Stress CMR is becoming more accessible and standardised around the globe and is ready for 'prime time' use in the non-invasive assessment of patients with suspected IHD.", "In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of orthodontics has gradually increased, and deep learning, as a hot direction, has also been rapidly applied in the detection, evaluation, diagnosis, prediction and effect evaluation. At present, deep learning research has the advantages of high efficiency and accuracy, but it also has limitations such as weak interpretability and insufficient data volume. This paper reviewed the proposal and development of deep learning, the application in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment, as well as the limitations and countermeasures of the popularization, and prospect of the future research.\n\u8fd1\u5e74\u53e3\u8154\u6b63\u7578\u9886\u57df\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u70ed\u95e8\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e5f\u8fc5\u901f\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6b63\u7578\u8bca\u7597\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u7597\u6548\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u73af\u8282\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u5f3a\u3001\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u9650\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u6b63\u7578\u8bca\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7b56\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5c55\u671b\u3002.", "According to the World Health Organization, about 15% of the world's population has some form of disability. Assistive Technology, in this context, contributes directly to the overcoming of difficulties encountered by people with disabilities in their daily lives, allowing them to receive education and become part of the labor market and society in a worthy manner. Assistive Technology has made great advances in its integration with Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices. AIoT processes and analyzes the large amount of data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applies Artificial Intelligence models, specifically, machine learning, to discover patterns for generating insights and assisting in decision making. Based on a systematic literature review, this article aims to identify the machine-learning models used across different research on Artificial Intelligence of Things applied to Assistive Technology. The survey of the topics approached in this article also highlights the context of such research, their application, the IoT devices used, and gaps and opportunities for further development. The survey results show that 50% of the analyzed research address visual impairment, and, for this reason, most of the topics cover issues related to computational vision. Portable devices, wearables, and smartphones constitute the majority of IoT devices. Deep neural networks represent 81% of the machine-learning models applied in the reviewed research.", "The most robust and economical method for laboratory diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is to identify mycobacteria acid-fast bacilli (AFB) under acid-fast staining, despite its disadvantages of low sensitivity and labor intensity. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in TB-smear microscopy to assist medical technologists with routine AFB smear microscopy. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a TB automated system consisting of a microscopic scanner and recognition program powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. This AI-based system can detect AFB and classify the level from 0 to 4+. A total of 5930 smears were evaluated on the performance of this automatic system in identifying AFB in daily lab practice. At the first stage, 120 images were analyzed per smear, and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 91.3%, 60.0%, and 95.7%, respectively. In the second stage, 200 images were analyzed per smear, and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were increased to 93.7%, 77.4%, and 96.6%. After removing disqualifying smears caused by poor staining quality and smear preparation, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were improved to 95.2%, 85.7%, and 96.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the automated system recovered 85 positive smears initially identified as negative by manual screening. Our results suggested that the automated TB system could achieve higher sensitivity and laboratory efficiency than manual microscopy under the quality control of smear preparation. Automated TB smear screening systems can serve as a screening tool at the first screen before manual microcopy.", "An alternative method to the classical fit of semi-empirical, statistical, or artificial intelligence-based models to retention data is proposed to predict surface excess adsorption and retention factors in liquid chromatography. The approach is based on a fundamental, microscopic description of the liquid-to-solid adsorption of analytes taking place at the interface between a bulk liquid phase and a solid surface. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed at T=300\u00a0K in a 100 \u00c5 wide slit-pore model (\u03b2-cristobalite-C18 surface in contact with an acetonitrile/water mobile phase) to quantify a priori the retention factors of small molecules expected in reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Uracil is chosen as the reference \"non-retained\" marker, whereas benzyl alcohol, acetophenone, benzene, and ethylbenzene are four selected retained, neutral compounds. The MD simulations allow to determine the pore-level density profiles of these five compounds, i.e., the variation of the analyte concentration as a function of distance from the silica surface. The retention factors of the retained analytes are expressed using their respective calculated surface excess adsorption relative to uracil. By definition, the retention factors are proportional to the surface excess adsorbed and the proportionality constant is directly scaled to the retention time of the \"non-retained\" marker. Experimentally, a 4.6\u00a0mm \u00d7 150\u00a0mm RPLC-C18 column packed with 5 \u03bcm 100 \u00c5 High Strength Silica (HSS)-C18 particles is used and the retention times of these five compounds are measured. The volume fraction of acetonitrile in water increases from 20 to 90% generating a wide range of retention factors from 0.15 to 183 at T=300\u00a0K. The results demonstrate very good agreement between the MD-predicted surface excess adsorption data and measured retention factors (R2> 0.985). A systematic error is observed as the proportionality constant is not exactly scaled to the retention time of uracil. This is most likely caused by the differences between the chemical and morphological features of the slit-pore model adopted in the MD simulations and those of the actual HSS-C18 particles: the average surface coverage with C18 chains, the geometry of the mesopores, and the pore size distribution. Specifically, the impact on RPLC retention of slight, local variations in surface chemistry (e.g., functional group density and uniformity) and how this aspect is affected by the pore space morphology (e.g., pore curvature and size) is worth investigating by future MD simulations.", "Machine learning (ML) models have proven their potential in acquiring and analyzing large amounts of data to help solve real-world, complex problems. Their use in healthcare is expected to help physicians make diagnoses, prognoses, treatment decisions, and disease outcome predictions. However, ML solutions are not currently deployed in most healthcare systems. One of the main reasons for this is the provenance, transparency, and clinical utility of the training data. Physicians reject ML solutions if they are not at least based on accurate data and do not clearly include the decision-making process used in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a hybrid human-machine intelligence method to create predictive models driven by clinical practice. We promote the use of quality-approved data and the inclusion of physician reasoning in the ML process. Instead of training the ML algorithms on the given data to create predictive models (conventional method), we propose to pre-categorize the data according to the expert physicians' knowledge and experience. Comparing the results of the conventional method of ML learning versus the hybrid physician-algorithm method showed that the models based on the latter can perform better. Physicians' engagement is the most promising condition for the safe and innovative use of ML in healthcare.", "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great development since 2009 because of their unique optoelectronic properties. However, the critical challenges in perovskite photovoltaics still hinder their practical application. The performance of PSCs is governed by a number of indivisible factors during device fabrication, some of which are implicit and receive little attention. Conventional research often follows an iterative trial and error manner to optimize the PSCs, wherein the underlying mechanisms for major processing are not clear. Bayesian Optimization (BO) shows great potential for accelerating the development of processing chemistry for PSCs, which have received success in resolving the black-box problems in artificial intelligence (AI). In this Perspective, we briefly introduce the BO algorithm and review and discuss the applications of BO in the field of perovskite photovoltaics. Outlooks of the BO applications in processing chemistry of PSCs are proposed briefly.", "Although artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been shown to be capable of identifying cardiac dysfunction, defined as ejection fraction (EF) \u2264 40%, from 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), identification of cardiac dysfunction using the single-lead ECG of a smartwatch has yet to be tested. In the present study, a prospective study in which patients of Mayo Clinic were invited by email to download a Mayo Clinic iPhone application that sends watch ECGs to a secure data platform, we examined patient engagement with the study app and the diagnostic utility of the ECGs. We digitally enrolled 2,454 unique patients (mean age 53\u2009\u00b1\u200915\u2009years, 56% female) from 46 US states and 11 countries, who sent 125,610 ECGs to the data platform between August 2021 and February 2022; 421 participants had at least one watch-classified sinus rhythm ECG within 30\u2009d of an echocardiogram, of whom 16 (3.8%) had an EF\u2009\u2264\u200940%. The AI algorithm detected patients with low EF with an area under the curve of 0.885 (95% confidence interval 0.823-0.946) and 0.881 (0.815-0.947), using the mean prediction within a 30-d window or the closest ECG relative to the echocardiogram that determined the EF, respectively. These findings indicate that consumer watch ECGs, acquired in nonclinical environments, can be used to identify patients with cardiac dysfunction, a potentially life-threatening and often asymptomatic condition.", "This paper explores a framework for defining artificial intelligence (AI) that adapts to individuals within a group, and discusses the technical challenges for collaborative AI systems that must work with different human partners. Collaborative AI is not one-size-fits-all, and thus AI systems must tune their output based on each human partner's needs and abilities. For example, when communicating with a partner, an AI should consider how prepared their partner is to receive and correctly interpret the information they are receiving. Forgoing such individual considerations may adversely impact the partner's mental state and proficiency. On the other hand, successfully adapting to each person's (or team member's) behavior and abilities can yield performance benefits for the human-AI team. Under this framework, an AI teammate adapts to human partners by first learning components of the human's decision-making process and then updating its own behaviors to positively influence the ongoing collaboration. This paper explains the role of this AI adaptation formalism in dyadic human-AI interactions and examines its application through a case study in a simulated navigation\u00a0domain.", "The number of older people needing healthcare is a growing global phenomenon. The assistance in long-term care comprises a complex of medical, nursing, rehabilitation, and social assistance services. The cost is substantial, but technology can help reduce spending by ensuring efficient health services and improving the quality of life. Advances in artificial intelligence, wireless communication systems, and nanotechnology allow the creation of intelligent home care systems avoiding hospitalization with evident cost containment. They are capable of ensuring functions of recognition of activities, monitoring of vital functions, and tracking. However, it is essential to also have information on location in order to be able to promptly intervene in case of unforeseen events or assist people in carrying out activities in order to avoid incorrect behavior. In addition, the automatic detection of physical activities performed by human subjects is identified as human activity recognition (HAR). This work presents an overview of the positioning system as part of an integrated HAR system. Lastly, this study contains each technology's concepts, features, accuracy, advantages, and limitations. With this work, we want to highlight the relationship between HAR and the indoor positioning system (IPS), which is poorly documented in the literature.", "Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have shown impaired performance in canonical and nonsocial working memory (WM). However, no study has investigated social WM and its early development. Using biological motion stimuli, our study assessed the development of social and nonsocial WM capacity among children with or without ASD across the age span between 4 and 6 (N\u00a0=\u00a0150). While typically developing (TD) children show a rapid development from age 5 to 6, children with ASD showed a delayed development for both social and nonsocial WM capacity, reaching a significant group difference at age 6. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between social (but not nonsocial) WM capacity and the severity of autistic symptoms among children with ASD. In contrast, there is a positive correlation between both types of WM capacity and intelligence among TD children but not among children with ASD. Our findings thus indicate that individuals with ASD miss the rapid development of WM capacity in early childhood and, particularly, their delayed social WM development might contribute to core symptoms that critically depend on social information processing.", "Introduction The New Deal for Surgery report encouraged using new technology in healthcare to address the 377,689 patients in England awaiting National Health Service (NHS) hospital treatment in July 2022. During the pandemic's second wave, this pilot study investigated the utility of COMPASS Surgical List Triage (COMPASS SLT; C2-Ai, Cambridge, England), an augmented intelligence-based system, in assisting surgical decision-making on patient prioritisation. Data generated from COMPASS SLT was compared to data from the British Association of Endocrine and Thyroid Surgeons' (BAETS) and Federation of Surgical Specialties Associations' (FSSA) prioritisation guidance. Methods A cohort of thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy patients on the surgical waiting list at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom, was used. COMPASS SLT calculated individuals' mortality and significant morbidity risk (risk >2.5%).\u00a0Significant morbidity risk was set at 2.5% or above following internal model validation, thus reducing the risk of model overfitting occurring with COMPASS SLT. The additional increase in mortality and morbidity due to treatment delay was calculated. Actual treatment time was aligned to the treatment delay (in weeks) experienced by each patient. Results Twenty-nine patients, with a median age of 43 years and a waiting time of 18 weeks\u00a0at the onset of the second wave, were enrolled. Non-statistically significant differences (p=0.937) between the FSSA and BAETS classifications were identified. However, cohort size could promote a type II error. An increase in median mortality and morbidity risk (p<0.001) arising from treatment delay and decisions based on the FSSA and BAETS classifications were identified. Conclusion COMPASS SLT can supplement clinical decision-making. An augmented intelligence tool can provide clinicians objectivity and flexibility in prioritising patients, with information on individual morbidity and mortality.", "Hip dysplasia (HD) leads to premature osteoarthritis. Timely detection and correction of HD has been shown to improve pain, functional status, and hip longevity. Several time-consuming radiological measurements are currently used to confirm HD. An artificial intelligence (AI) software named HIPPO automatically locates anatomical landmarks on anteroposterior pelvis radiographs and performs the needed measurements. The primary aim of this study was to assess the reliability of this tool as compared to multi-reader evaluation in clinically proven cases of adult HD. The secondary aims were to assess the time savings achieved and evaluate inter-reader assessment.\nA consecutive preoperative sample of 130 HD patients (256 hips) was used. This cohort included 82.3% females (n = 107) and 17.7% males (n = 23) with median patient age of 28.6 years (interquartile range (IQR) 22.5 to 37.2). Three trained readers' measurements were compared to AI outputs of lateral centre-edge angle (LCEA), caput-collum-diaphyseal (CCD) angle, pelvic obliquity, T\u00f6nnis angle, Sharp's angle, and femoral head coverage. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman analyses were obtained.\nAmong 256 hips with AI outputs, all six hip AI measurements were successfully obtained. The AI-reader correlations were generally good (ICC 0.60 to 0.74) to excellent (ICC > 0.75). There was lower agreement for CCD angle measurement. Most widely used measurements for HD diagnosis (LCEA and T\u00f6nnis angle) demonstrated good to excellent inter-method reliability (ICC 0.71 to 0.86 and 0.82 to 0.90, respectively). The median reading time for the three readers and AI was 212 (IQR 197 to 230), 131 (IQR 126 to 147), 734 (IQR 690 to 786), and 41 (IQR 38 to 44) seconds, respectively.\nThis study showed that AI-based software demonstrated reliable radiological assessment of patients with HD with significant interpretation-related time savings.Cite this article: Bone Jt Open\u00a02022;3(11):877-884.", "Faced with the current time-sensitive COVID-19 pandemic, the overburdened healthcare systems have resulted in a strong demand to develop newer methods to control the spread of the pandemic. Big data and artificial intelligence (AI) have been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little is known about their use for supporting public health efforts. In epidemic surveillance and containment, efforts are needed to treat critical patients, track and manage the health status of residents, isolate suspected cases, and develop vaccines and antiviral drugs. The applications of emerging practices of artificial intelligence and big data have become powerful \"weapons\" to fight against the pandemic and provide strong support in pandemic prevention and control, such as early warning, analysis and judgment, interruption and intervention of epidemic, to achieve goals of early detection, early report, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment. These are the decisive factors to control the spread of the epidemic and reduce the mortality. This paper systematically summarized the application of big data and AI in epidemic, and describes practical cases and challenges with emphasis on epidemic prevention and control. The included studies showed that big data and AI have the potential strength to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet widely accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research would be on methods that promise value beyond COVID-19. More efforts are needed for developing standardized reporting protocols or guidelines for practice.", "Intelligent manufacturing, defined as the integration of manufacturing with modern information technologies such as 5G, digitalization, networking, and intelligence, has grown in popularity as a means of boosting the productivity, intelligence, and flexibility of traditional manufacturing processes. The steel industry is a necessary support for modern life and economic development, and the Chinese steel industry's capacity has expanded to roughly half of global production. However, the Chinese steel industry is now confronted with high labor costs, massive carbon emissions, a low level of intelligence, low production efficiency, and unstable quality control. Therefore, China's steel industry has launched several large-scale intelligent manufacturing initiatives to improve production efficiency, product quality, manual labor intensity, and employee working conditions. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive overview of intelligent manufacturing in China's steel industry. We began this research by summarizing the construction goals and overall framework for intelligent manufacturing of the steel industry in China. Following that, we offered a brief review of intelligent manufacturing for China's steel industry, as well as descriptions of two typical intelligent manufacturing models. Finally, some major technologies employed for intelligent production in China's steel industry were introduced. This research not only helps to comprehend the development model, essential technologies, and construction techniques of intelligent manufacturing in China's steel industry, but it also provides vital inspiration for the manufacturing industry's digital and intelligence updates and quality improvement.", "Corneal and ocular surface diseases (OSDs) carry significant psychosocial and economic burden worldwide. We set out to review the literature on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatics for analysis of biofluid biomarkers in corneal and OSDs and evaluate their utility in clinical decision making. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and Web of Science were systematically queried for articles using AI or bioinformatics methodology in corneal and OSDs and examining biofluids from inception to August 2021. In total, 10,264 articles were screened, and 23 articles consisting of 1058 individuals were included. Using various AI/bioinformatics tools, changes in certain tear film cytokines that are proinflammatory such as increased expression of apolipoprotein, haptoglobin, annexin 1, S100A8, S100A9,\u00a0Glutathione S-transferase, and decreased expression of supportive tear film components such as lipocalin-1, prolactin inducible protein, lysozyme C, lactotransferrin, cystatin S, and mammaglobin-b, proline rich protein, were found to be correlated with pathogenesis and/or treatment outcomes of dry eye, keratoconus, meibomian gland dysfunction, and Sj\u00f6gren's. Overall, most AI/bioinformatics tools were used to classify biofluids into diseases subgroups, distinguish between OSD, identify risk factors, or make predictions about treatment response, and/or prognosis. To conclude, AI models such as artificial neural networks, hierarchical clustering, random forest, etc., in conjunction\u00a0with proteomic or metabolomic profiling using bioinformatics tools such as Gene Ontology or Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, were found to inform biomarker discovery, distinguish between OSDs, help define subgroups with OSDs and make predictions about treatment response in a clinical setting.\n\u6458\u8981: \u89d2\u819c\u548c\u773c\u8868\u75be\u75c5 (OSDs) \u5728\u4e16\u754c\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd (AI) \u548c\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u89d2\u819c\u548c\u773c\u8868\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u751f\u7269\u6d41\u4f53\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7efc\u8ff0, \u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002 \u672c\u6587\u5bf9MEDLINE\u3001EMBASE\u3001Cochrane\u548cWeb of Science\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b5b\u9009, \u627e\u5230\u4ece\u5efa\u5e93\u52302021\u5e748\u6708\u671f\u95f4\u5c06\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6216\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u89d2\u819c\u548c\u773c\u8868\u75be\u75c5\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u4f53\u6db2\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u3002\u5171\u7b5b\u900910264\u7bc7\u6587\u732e, \u7eb3\u516523\u7bc7, \u51711058\u4f4d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u3002 \u4f7f\u7528\u5404\u79cd\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd/\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u4fc3\u708e\u6027\u6cea\u819c\u7ec6\u80de\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u53d8\u5316, \u4f8b\u5982\u8f7d\u8102\u86cb\u767d\u3001\u7ed3\u5408\u73e0\u86cb\u767d\u3001\u819c\u8054\u86cb\u767d1\u3001S100A8\u3001S100A9\u548c\u8c37\u80f1\u7518\u80bdS-\u8f6c\u79fb\u9176\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u589e\u52a0, \u652f\u6301\u6027\u6cea\u819c\u6210\u5206\u5982\u8102\u8d28\u8fd0\u8f7d\u86cb\u767d-1\u3001\u50ac\u4e73\u7d20\u8bf1\u5bfc\u86cb\u767d\u3001\u6eb6\u83cc\u9176C\u3001\u4e73\u8f6c\u94c1\u86cb\u767d\u3001\u80f1\u6291\u7d20S\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u51cf\u5c11, \u4e73\u7403\u86cb\u767d-B\u548c\u812f\u6c28\u9178\u5bcc\u96c6\u7c7b\u86cb\u767d\u7b49\u4e0e\u5e72\u773c\u75c7\u3001\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\u3001\u7751\u677f\u817a\u529f\u80fd\u969c\u788d\u548c\u5e72\u71e5\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u548c/\u6216\u6cbb\u7597\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u603b\u4e4b, \u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd/\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u751f\u7269\u6db2\u4f53\u5c06\u75be\u75c5\u4e9a\u7fa4\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b, \u4ece\u800c\u533a\u5206\u773c\u8868\u75be\u75c5, \u8bc6\u522b\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u6216\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7597\u53cd\u5e94\u548c/\u6216\u9884\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002 \u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4, \u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc, \u5206\u5c42\u805a\u7c7b, \u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b49, \u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ec4\u6216\u4ee3\u8c22\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u5de5\u5177, \u5982\u57fa\u56e0\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u6216\u4eac\u90fd\u57fa\u56e0\u548c\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u6790\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u4e66, \u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f, \u533a\u5206\u773c\u8868\u75be\u75c5, \u5e2e\u52a9\u5b9a\u4e49\u773c\u8868\u75be\u75c5\u4e9a\u7fa4, \u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u6cbb\u7597\u53cd\u5e94\u3002.", "Lycopene consumption reduces risk and incidence of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Tomatoes are a rich source of phytochemical compounds including lycopene as a major constituent. Lycopene estimation using high-performance liquid chromatography is time-consuming and expensive.\nTo develop artificial intelligence models for prediction of lycopene in raw tomatoes using 14 different physicochemical parameters including salinity, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), firmness, pH, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), colour values on Hunter scale (L, a, b), total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and antioxidant activity (AOA).\nThe post-harvest data acquisition was collected through investigation for more than 100 raw tomatoes stored for 15\u2009days. Linear multivariate regression (LMVR), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were developed by splitting data set into train and test datasets. The training of models was performed using 10-fold cross validation (CV).\nPrincipal component analysis showed strong positive association between lycopene, colour value 'a', TPC, TFC and AOA. The R2 (CV), root mean square error (RMSE) (CV) and RMSE (Test) for best LMVR model was observed to be at 0.70, 8.48 and 9.69 respectively. The PCR model revealed R2 (CV) at 0.59, RMSE (CV) at 8.91 and RMSE (Test) at 10.17 while PLSR model revealed R2 (CV) at 0.60, RMSE (CV) at 9.10 and RMSE (Test) at 10.11.\nResults of the present study show that epidemiological studies suggest fully ripened tomatoes are most beneficial for consumption to ensure recommended daily intake of lycopene content.", "Real-time tracking welding with the assistance of structured light vision enhances the intelligence of robotic welding, which significantly shortens teaching time and guarantees accuracy for user-customized product welding. However, the robustness of most image processing algorithms is deficient during welding practice, and the security regime for tracking welding is not considered in most trajectory recognition and control algorithms. For these two problems, an adaptive feature extraction algorithm was proposed, which can accurately extract the seam center from the continuous, discontinuous or fluctuating laser stripes identified and located by the CNN model, while the prior model can quickly remove a large amount of noise and interference except the stripes, greatly improving the extraction accuracy and processing speed of the algorithm. Additionally, the embedded Pauta criterion was used to segmentally process the center point data stream and to cyclically eliminate outliers and further ensure the accuracy of the welding reference point. Experimental results showed that under the guarantee of the above-mentioned seam center point extraction and correction algorithms, the tracking average error was 0.1 mm, and even if abnormal trajectory points existed, they did not cause welding torch shaking, system interruption or other accidents.", "Non-coordinated physical activity may lead to hypoglycemia, which is a dangerous condition for diabetic people. Decision support systems related to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) still lack the capability of automated therapy modification by recognizing and categorizing the physical activity. Further, this desired adaptive therapy should be achieved without increasing the administrative load, which is already high for the diabetic community. These requirements can be satisfied by using artificial intelligence-based solutions, signals collected by wearable devices, and relying on the already available data sources, such as continuous glucose monitoring systems. In this work, we focus on the detection of physical activity by using a continuous glucose monitoring system and a wearable sensor providing the heart rate-the latter is accessible even in the cheapest wearables. Our results show that the detection of physical activity is possible based on these data sources, even if only low-complexity artificial intelligence models are deployed. In general, our models achieved approximately 90% accuracy in the detection of physical activity.", "In the field of regulatory science, reviewing literature is an essential and important step, which most of the time is conducted by manually reading hundreds of articles. Although this process is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive, most output of this process is not well transformed into machine-readable format. The limited availability of data has largely constrained the artificial intelligence (AI) system development to facilitate this literature reviewing in the regulatory process. In the past decade, AI has revolutionized the area of text mining as many deep learning approaches have been developed to search, annotate, and classify relevant documents. After the great advancement of AI algorithms, a lack of high-quality data instead of the algorithms has recently become the bottleneck of AI system development. Herein, we constructed two large benchmark datasets, Chlorine Efficacy dataset (CHE) and Chlorine Safety dataset (CHS), under a regulatory scenario that sought to assess the antiseptic efficacy and toxicity of chlorine. For each dataset, \u223c10,000 scientific articles were initially collected, manually reviewed, and their relevance to the review task were labeled. To ensure high data quality, each paper was labeled by a consensus among multiple experienced reviewers. The overall relevance rate was 27.21% (2,663 of 9,788) for CHE and 7.50% (761 of 10,153) for CHS, respectively. Furthermore, the relevant articles were categorized into five subgroups based on the focus of their content. Next, we developed an attention-based classification language model using these two datasets. The proposed classification model yielded 0.857 and 0.908 of Area Under the Curve (AUC) for CHE and CHS dataset, respectively. This performance was significantly better than permutation test (p\u00a0<\u00a010E-9), demonstrating that the labeling processes were valid. To conclude, our datasets can be used as benchmark to develop AI systems, which can further facilitate the literature review process in regulatory science.", "This quality improvement study, entitled Avatar-Based LEarning for Diabetes Optimal Control (ABLEDOC), explored the feasibility of delivering an educational program to people with diabetes in Colombia. The aim was to discover how this approach could be used to improve awareness and understanding of the condition, the effects of treatment, and strategies for effective management of blood-glucose control.\nIndividuals with diabetes were recruited by Colombian endocrinologists to a human-centered study to codesign the educational program, using the Double Diamond model. Participants contributed to two phases. The first phase focused on gathering unmet educational needs and choice of curriculum. Three prototypes were developed as a result. During phase 2, a different group of participants engaged with the program for several weeks, before reporting back.\nThirty-six participants completed a Web survey during phase 1, and five were also interviewed by telephone. The majority (33 of 36; 91%) were receptive to the prospect of educational interventions and ranked the chosen topic of hypoglycemia highly. In phase 2, the three prototypes were tested by 17 participants, 10 of whom also gave feedback in focus groups. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with 16 of 17 (94%) stating they would use a program like this again. The 3D version was the most highly rated.\nImmersive, avatar-based programs, delivered through smartphone, have the potential to deliver educational information that is trusted, engaging, and useful. Future work includes expansion of the curriculum, evaluation with a larger group, and exploration of the prospective role of artificial intelligence in personalizing this form of educational intervention.", "The rapid growth of the world population has increased the food demand as well as the need for assurance of food quality, safety, and sustainability. However, food security can easily be compromised by not only natural hazards but also changes in food preferences, political conflicts, and food frauds. In order to contribute to building a more sustainable food system-digitally visible and processes measurable-within this review, we summarized currently available evidence for various information and communication technologies (ICTs) that can be utilized to support collaborative actions, prevent fraudulent activities, and remotely perform real-time monitoring, which has become essential, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Internet of Everything, 6G, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and digital twin are gaining significant attention in recent years in anticipation of leveraging the creativity of human experts in collaboration with efficient, intelligent, and accurate machines, but with limited consideration in the food supply chain. Therefore, this paper provided a thorough review of the food system by showing how various ICT tools can help sense and quantify the food system and highlighting the key enhancements that Industry 5.0 technologies can bring. The vulnerability of the food system can be effectively mitigated with the utilization of various ICTs depending on not only the nature and severity of crisis but also the specificity of the food supply chain. There are numerous ways of implementing these technologies, and they are continuously evolving.", "The automatic detection of violent actions in public places through video analysis is difficult because the employed Artificial Intelligence-based techniques often suffer from generalization problems. Indeed, these algorithms hinge on large quantities of annotated data and usually experience a drastic drop in performance when used in scenarios never seen during the supervised learning phase. In this paper, we introduce and publicly release the Bus Violence benchmark, the first large-scale collection of video clips for violence detection on public transport, where some actors simulated violent actions inside a moving bus in changing conditions, such as the background or light. Moreover, we conduct a performance analysis of several state-of-the-art video violence detectors pre-trained with general violence detection databases on this newly established use case. The achieved moderate performances reveal the difficulties in generalizing from these popular methods, indicating the need to have this new collection of labeled data, beneficial for specializing them in this new scenario.", "In satellite remote sensing applications, waterbody segmentation plays an essential role in mapping and monitoring the dynamics of surface water. Satellite image segmentation-examining a relevant sensor data spectrum and identifying the regions of interests to obtain improved performance-is a fundamental step in satellite data analytics. Satellite image segmentation is challenging for a number of reasons, which include cloud interference, inadequate label data, low lighting and the presence of terrain. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), combined with (satellite captured) multispectral image segmentation techniques, have led to promising advances in related research. However, ensuring sufficient image resolution, maintaining class balance to achieve prediction quality and reducing the computational overhead of the deep neural architecture are still open to research due to the sophisticated CNN hierarchical architectures. To address these issues, we propose a number of methods: a multi-channel Data-Fusion Module (DFM), Neural Adaptive Patch (NAP) augmentation algorithm and re-weight class balancing (implemented in our PHR-CB experimental setup). We integrated these techniques into our novel Fusion Adaptive Patch Network (FAPNET). Our dataset is the Sentinel-1 SAR microwave signal, used in the Microsoft Artificial Intelligence for Earth competition, so that we can compare our results with the top scores in the competition. In order to validate our approach, we designed four experimental setups and in each setup, we compared our results with the popular image segmentation models UNET, VNET, DNCNN, UNET++, U2NET, ATTUNET, FPN and LINKNET. The comparisons demonstrate that our PHR-CB setup, with class balance, generates the best performance for all models in general and our FAPNET approach outperforms relative works. FAPNET successfully detected the salient features from the satellite images. FAPNET with a MeanIoU score of 87.06% outperforms the state-of-the-art UNET, which has a score of 79.54%. In addition, FAPNET has a shorter training time than other models, comparable to that of UNET (6.77 min for 5 epochs). Qualitative analysis also reveals that our FAPNET model successfully distinguishes micro waterbodies better than existing models. FAPNET is more robust to low lighting, cloud and weather fluctuations and can also be used in RGB images. Our proposed method is lightweight, computationally inexpensive, robust and simple to deploy in industrial applications. Our research findings show that flood-water mapping is more accurate when using SAR signals than RGB images. Our FAPNET architecture, having less parameters than UNET, can distinguish micro waterbodies accurately with shorter training time.", "Constrained random stimulus generation is no longer sufficient to fully simulate the functionality of a digital design. The increasing complexity of today's hardware devices must be supported by powerful development and simulation environments, powerful computational mechanisms, and appropriate software to exploit them. Reinforcement learning, a powerful technique belonging to the field of artificial intelligence, provides the means to efficiently exploit computational resources to find even the least obvious correlations between configuration parameters, stimuli applied to digital design inputs, and their functional states. This paper, in which a novel software system is used to simplify the analysis of simulation outputs and the generation of input stimuli through reinforcement learning methods, provides important details about the setup of the proposed method to automate the verification process. By understanding how to properly configure a reinforcement algorithm to fit the specifics of a digital design, verification engineers can more quickly adopt this automated and efficient stimulus generation method (compared with classical verification) to bring the digital design to a desired functional state. The results obtained are most promising, with even 52 times fewer steps needed to reach a target state using reinforcement learning than when constrained random stimulus generation was used.", "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retina are functionally and structurally connected tissues that work together to regulate light perception and vision. Proteins on the RPE apical surface are tightly associated with proteins on the photoreceptor outer segment surface, making it difficult to consistently separate the RPE from the photoreceptors/retina. We developed a method to efficiently separate the retina from the RPE of human eyes to generate complete RPE/choroid and retina flatmounts for separate cellular analysis of the photoreceptors and RPE cells. An intravitreal injection of a high-osmolarity solution of D-mannitol, a sugar not transported by the RPE, induced the separation of the RPE and retina across the entire posterior chamber without causing damage to the RPE cell junctions. No RPE patches were observed attached to the retina. Phalloidin labeling of actin showed RPE shape preservation and allowed morphometric analysis of the entire epithelium. An artificial intelligence (AI)-based software was developed to accurately recognize and segment the RPE cell borders and quantify 30 different shape metrics. This dissection method is highly reproducible and can be easily extended to other animal models.", "Artificial intelligences (AIs) are emerging in the field of medical informatics in many areas. They are mostly used for diagnosis support in medical imaging but have potential uses in many other fields of medicine where large datasets are available.\nTo develop an artificial intelligence (AI) \"ToxNet\", a machine-learning based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system, which aims to predict poisons based on patient's symptoms and metadata from our Poison Control Center (PCC) data. To prove its accuracy and compare it against medical doctors (MDs).\nThe CADx system was developed and trained using data from 781,278 calls recorded in our PCC database from 2001 to 2019. All cases were mono-intoxications. Patient symptoms and meta-information (e.g., age group, sex, etiology, toxin point of entry, weekday, etc.) were provided. In the pilot phase, the AI was trained on 10 substances, the AI's prediction was compared to na\u00efve matching, literature matching, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and the graph attention network (GAT). The trained AI's accuracy was then compared to 10 medical doctors in an individual and in an identical dataset. The dataset was then expanded to 28 substances and the predictions and comparisons repeated.\nIn the pilot, the prediction performance in a set of 8995 patients with 10 substances was 0.66\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 (F1 micro score). Our CADx system was significantly superior to na\u00efve matching, literature matching, MLP, and GAT (p\u2009<\u20090.005). It outperformed our physicians experienced in clinical toxicology in the individual and identical dataset. In the extended dataset, our CADx system was able to predict the correct toxin in a set of 36,033 patients with 28 substances with an overall performance of 0.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 (F1 micro score), also significantly superior to na\u00efve matching, literature matching, MLP, and GAT. It also outperformed our MDs.\nOur AI trained on a large PCC database works well for poison prediction in these experiments. With further research, it might become a valuable aid for physicians in predicting unknown substances and might be the first step into AI use in PCCs.", "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens the healthcare system worldwide with the rise of emerging drug resistant infectious agents. AMR may render the current therapeutics ineffective or diminish their efficacy, and its rapid dissemination can have unmitigated health and socioeconomic consequences. Just like with many other health problems, recent computational advances including developments in machine learning or artificial intelligence hold a prodigious promise in deciphering genetic factors underlying emergence and dissemination of AMR and in aiding development of therapeutics for more efficient AMR solutions. Current machine learning frameworks focus mainly on known AMR genes and are, therefore, prone to missing genes that have not been implicated in resistance yet, including many uncharacterized genes whose functions have not yet been elucidated. Furthermore, new resistance traits may evolve from these genes leading to the rise of superbugs, and therefore, these genes need to be characterized. To infer novel resistance genes, we used complete gene sets of several bacterial strains known to be susceptible or resistant to specific drugs and associated phenotypic information within a machine learning framework that enabled prioritizing genes potentially involved in resistance. Further, homology modeling of proteins encoded by prioritized genes and subsequent molecular docking studies indicated stable interactions between these proteins and the antimicrobials that the strains containing these proteins are known to be resistant to. Our study highlights the capability of a machine learning framework to uncover novel genes that have not yet been implicated in resistance to any antimicrobials and thus could spur further studies targeted at neutralizing AMR.", "The rapid development of deep-learning-based edge artificial intelligence applications and their data-driven nature has led to several research issues. One key issue is the collaboration of the edge and cloud to optimize such applications by increasing inference speed and reducing latency. Some researchers have focused on simulations that verify that a collaborative edge-cloud network would be optimal, but the real-world implementation is not considered. Most researchers focus on the accuracy of the detection and recognition algorithm but not the inference speed in actual deployment. Others have implemented such networks with minimal pressure on the cloud node, thus defeating the purpose of an edge-cloud collaboration. In this study, we propose a method to increase inference speed and reduce latency by implementing a real-time face recognition system in which all face detection tasks are handled on the edge device and by forwarding cropped face images that are significantly smaller than the whole video frame, while face recognition tasks are processed at the cloud. In this system, both devices communicate using the TCP/IP protocol of wireless communication. Our experiment is executed using a Jetson Nano GPU board and a PC as the cloud. This framework is studied in terms of the frame-per-second (FPS) rate. We further compare our framework using two scenarios in which face detection and recognition tasks are deployed on the (1) edge and (2) cloud. The experimental results show that combining the edge and cloud is an effective way to accelerate the inferencing process because the maximum FPS achieved by the edge-cloud deployment was 1.91\u00d7 more than the cloud deployment and 8.5\u00d7 more than the edge deployment.", "The hybrid optimization of modern cementitious materials requires concrete to meet many competing objectives (e.g., mechanical properties, cost, workability, environmental requirements, and durability). This paper reviews the current literature on optimizing mixing ratios using machine learning and metaheuristic optimization algorithms based on past studies on varying methods. In this review, we first discuss the conventional methods for mixing optimization of cementitious materials. Then, the problem expression of hybrid optimization is discussed, including decision variables, constraints, machine learning algorithms for modeling objectives, and metaheuristic optimization algorithms for searching the best mixture ratio. Finally, we explore the development prospects of this field, including, expanding the database by combining field data, considering more influencing variables, and considering more competitive targets in the production of functional cemented materials. In addition, to overcome the limitation of the swarm intelligence-based multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithm in hybrid optimization, this paper proposes a new MOO algorithm based on individual intelligence (multi-objective beetle antenna search algorithm). The development of computationally efficient robust MOO models will continue to make progress in the field of hybrid optimization. This review is adapted for engineers and researchers who want to optimize the mixture proportions of cementitious materials using machine learning and metaheuristic algorithms.", "Smart health presents an ever-expanding attack surface due to the continuous adoption of a broad variety of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices and applications. IoMT is a common approach to smart city solutions that deliver long-term benefits to critical infrastructures, such as smart healthcare. Many of the IoMT devices in smart cities use Bluetooth technology for short-range communication due to its flexibility, low resource consumption, and flexibility. As smart healthcare applications rely on distributed control optimization, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) offer effective approaches to mitigate cyber-attacks. This paper presents a decentralized, predictive, DL-based process to autonomously detect and block malicious traffic and provide an end-to-end defense against network attacks in IoMT devices. Furthermore, we provide the BlueTack dataset for Bluetooth-based attacks against IoMT networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first intrusion detection dataset for Bluetooth classic and Bluetooth low energy (BLE). Using the BlueTack dataset, we devised a multi-layer intrusion detection method that uses deep-learning techniques. We propose a decentralized architecture for deploying this intrusion detection system on the edge nodes of a smart healthcare system that may be deployed in a smart city. The presented multi-layer intrusion detection models achieve performances in the range of 97-99.5% based on the F1 scores.", "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to whole slide images has the potential to improve research reliability and ultimately diagnostic efficiency and service capacity. Image annotation plays a key role in AI and digital pathology. However, the work-streams required for tissue-specific (skin) and immunostain-specific annotation has not been extensively studied compared with the development of AI algorithms.\nThe objective of this study is to develop a common workflow for annotating whole slide images of biopsies from inflammatory skin disease immunostained with a variety of epidermal and dermal markers prior to the development of the AI-assisted analysis pipeline.\nA total of 45 slides containing 3-5 sections each were scanned using Aperio AT2 slide scanner (Leica Biosystems). These slides were annotated by hand using a commonly used image analysis tool which resulted in more than 4000 images blocks. We used deep learning (DL) methodology to first sequentially segment (epidermis and upper dermis), with the exclusion of common artefacts and second to quantify the immunostained signal in those two compartments of skin biopsies and the ratio of positive cells.\nWe validated two DL models using 10-fold validation runs and by comparing to ground truth manually annotated data. The models achieved an average (global) accuracy of 95.0% for the segmentation of epidermis and dermis and 86.1% for the segmentation of positive/negative cells.\nThe application of two DL models in sequence facilitates accurate segmentation of epidermal and dermal structures, exclusion of common artefacts and enables the quantitative analysis of the immunostained signal. However, inaccurate annotation of the slides for training the DL model can decrease the accuracy of the output. Our open source code will facilitate further external validation across different immunostaining platforms and slide scanners.", "People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and non-spectrum developmental delays frequently exhibit maladaptive behaviors throughout the lifespan, which can have pervasive effects on quality of life. Maladaptive behaviors have been shown to change over time as a function of various individual-level factors (e.g., cognitive ability), yet research is primarily limited to parent-reported measures. To expand upon this work, the present study aimed to examine trajectories of teacher- and parent-reported maladaptive behaviors (i.e., hyperactivity, irritability, social withdrawal) and to test whether individual-level predictors (e.g., autism features, verbal intelligence quotient) and school-related predictors (e.g., teacher type, student-adult ratio, personal aide, school type) impact these trajectories among 165 individuals with ASD or non-spectrum delays from ages 9 to 18. Multilevel models revealed that, according to both teacher and parent report, participants showed the greatest improvement in hyperactivity, less but still notable improvement in irritability, and stable levels of social withdrawal over time. Higher verbal ability and fewer ASD features, in addition to mainstream school placement, emerged as important individual- and school-related differences associated with fewer maladaptive behaviors over time. The multi-informant perspective and longitudinal design provide novel insight into the manifestations of these maladaptive behaviors across different contexts and across time. Findings highlight the consistency of teacher- and parent-reported trajectories over time and further emphasize the importance of targeting maladaptive behaviors using a multisystem intervention approach in both school and home contexts.", "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a pervasive disorder with an incidence estimated at 5-14\u2009percent among adults aged 30-70\u2009years. It carries significant morbidity and mortality risk from cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and cerebrovascular disease, and risks related to excessive daytime sleepiness. The gold standard for diagnosis of OSAS is the polysomnography (PSG) test which requires overnight evaluation in a sleep laboratory and expensive infrastructure, which renders it unsuitable for mass screening and diagnosis. Alternatives such as home sleep testing need patients to wear diagnostic instruments overnight, but accuracy continues to be suboptimal while access continues to be a barrier for many. Hence, there is a continued significant underdiagnosis and under-recognition of sleep apnea in the community, with at least one study suggesting that 80-90% of middle-aged adults with moderate to severe sleep apnea remain undiagnosed. Recently, we have seen a surge in applications of artificial intelligence and neural networks in healthcare diagnostics. Several studies have attempted to examine its application in the diagnosis of OSAS. Signals included in data analytics include Electrocardiogram (ECG), photo-pletysmography (PPG), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), and audio signals. A different approach is to study the application of machine learning to use demographic and standard clinical variables and physical findings to try and synthesize predictive models with high accuracy in assisting in the triage of high-risk patients for sleep testing. The current paper will review this latter approach and identify knowledge gaps that may serve as potential avenues for future research.", "Cognitive-behavioral alterations can occur after an acquired brain injury (ABI).\nTo develop and evaluate a synchronous online training program on emotional intelligence (EI) for the caregivers of adult patients with cognitive-behavioral impairment due to ABI.\nQuasi-experimental study. Ten caregivers attended a one-month virtual synchronous course about EI. The emotional status of the caregivers was registered one-month-previous and one-month-post program using comparative measures: The Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Caregiver Burden Interview, the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Emotional Health Survey.\nAfter the training course, the favorable changes related to emotional affect measured with the PANAS questionnaire were found; both positive (increase; Mdn = 39.5; effect size -12.79; adjusted variance 95.75) and negative (decrease; Mdn = 14.5; effect size 0.73; adjusted variance 95.50) presented a statistical significance of p < 0.05. The TMMS-24 post-test showed that 90% of the caregivers reported an adequate or excellent emotional repair (p < 0.05; effect size -0.68; adjusted variance 94.75). No other significant differences were found.\nAfter this training in EI, the caregivers had a more positive mood and improved aspects of their emotional intelligence, such as emotional regulation. More studies need to be conducted.", "Emotional intelligence has been a topic of great interest to researchers in many different areas as it is associated with mental, psychosomatic, and physical health. In the sports context, it is a significant variable that can play an important role in improving the team's performance. Although there are numerous tools to assess emotional intelligence, few of them have been validated explicitly in a sports sample, and even fewer have had coaches as a target population. Therefore, this study aimed to validate the Spanish version of the work group emotional intelligence profile short version (WEIP-S) in a sample of Spanish federated coaches. The results confirm that this instrument presents good psychometric properties to measure the emotional intelligence of sports coaches. The original four-factor model (awareness of one's own emotions, management of one's own emotions, awareness of others' emotions, and management of others' emotions) shows good reliability and convergent validity for all four factors except for the management of one's own emotions. These findings suggest that it is possible to measure the emotional intelligence of coaches and offer the opportunity to continue investigating the relevance of constructing specific scales to measure this construct in the sports context.", "To investigate the joint effect of maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) on children's cognitive development. We recruited 1685 mother-child pairs from the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort in China. Pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG were calculated based on the height and weights measured at multiple antenatal checkups. Children's cognition was assessed by Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition. Poisson regression model was used to analyze the association between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and children's cognitive dimensions under different GWG categories. Women with overweight or obese before pregnancy were more likely to obtain excessive GWG. When women had excessive GWG, pre-pregnancy overweight was associated with low children's PSI (OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.02-2.81) and pre-pregnancy obesity was related to poor VCI in children (OR = 3.71, 95%CI: 1.49-9.22), after adjusting for potential confounders. In pre-pregnancy underweight mothers, adequate GWG reduced the risk of below-average VSI in children (OR = 0.22, 95%CI: 0.05-0.92), but excessive GWG was related to low FSIQ in children (OR = 2.53, 95%CI: 1.34-4.76). In women with excessive GWG, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI displays an inverted U-shape association with children's cognition. Moreover, adequate GWG in women with pre-pregnancy underweight was beneficial for children's cognition.", "Studies on methods to share nursing and learning experiences with preceptors are lacking. This study was conducted to determine the preliminary effects of developing and applying a reflective practice program for preceptor nurses who experience stressful situations to convert negative emotions into positive ones. This study was conducted over 12 weeks from March to May 2022 on 47 participant nurses in South Korea. Preceptor Reflective Practice Program (PRPP) was conducted in parallel with writing a reflective journal and a reflective practice workshop. Data collection was integrated through quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data were collected through questionnaires on stress coping, the burden of preceptors, social support, and emotional intelligence, and analyzed by SPSS WIN 26.0 program. The questionnaire data were analyzed after the preceptor nurses had written a reflective journal. Stress coping, social support, and emotional intelligence significantly increased in preceptor nurses after participating in the PRPP. This study found that the PRPP helped nurses improve their emotional intelligence through reflective practice and convert stress into a more positive direction. Therefore, at the organizational and national levels, a reasonable compensation system to provide support workforce and to the work of preceptor nurses should be established.", "Swarm intelligence algorithm has attracted a lot of interest since its development, which has been proven to be effective in many application areas. In this study, an enhanced integrated learning technique of improved particle swarm optimization and BPNN (Back Propagation Neural Network) is proposed. First, the theory of good point sets is used to create a particle swarm with a uniform initial spatial distribution. So a good point set adaptive particle swarm optimization (GPSAPSO) algorithm was created by using a multi-population co-evolution approach and introducing a function that dynamically changes the inertia weights with the number of iterations. Sixteen benchmark functions were used to confirm the efficacy of the algorithm. Secondly, a parallel integrated approach combining the GPSAPSO algorithm and the BPNN was developed and utilized to build a water quality prediction model. Finally, four sets of cross-sectional data of the Huai River in Bengbu, Anhui Province, China, were used as simulation data for experiments. The experimental results show that the GPSAPSO-BPNN algorithm has obvious advantages compared with TTPSO-BPNN, NSABC-BPNN, IGSO-BPNN and CRBA-BPNN algorithms, which improves the accuracy of water quality prediction results and provides a scientific basis for water quality monitoring and management.", "Human resilience is dynamic and generated through myriad interactions starting from early childhood. Resilience can improve quality of life and longevity.\nThe current analysis evaluates childhood resilience at 9 years of age and its associations with concurrent cognition and early childhood factors, using longitudinal follow-up of a community birth cohort in Vellore, south India.\nResilience was assessed using the Child and Youth Resilience Measure and cognition utilizing the Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children. Early childhood variables included growth stunting, maternal depression scores, home environment scores, and socio-economic status (SES) at 2 years of age. Statistical evaluation included bivariate analysis with further multi-variate regression for each resilience domain and the total resilience score.\nOut of 251 newborns recruited into the original birth cohort, 205 (81.7%) children were available for the 9-year follow-up. Mean (SD) scores in individual, caregiving, and context domains of resilience were 26.34 (3.2), 19.52 (1.6), and 20 (1.8) respectively. Individual resilience domain was associated with verbal cognition scores at 9 years of age (0.07, p = 0.019) and total home environment scores (0.16, p = 0.027) at 2 years of age, when adjusted for stunting, maternal depression, and SES. The total resilience score was associated only with concurrent verbal intelligence (0.08, p = 0.026) after adjustment with early childhood factors. Analysis of individual home environment factors showed that daily stimulation was associated with the individual domain of resilience.\nFollow-up of an Indian birth cohort showed that in addition to concurrent cognitive abilities, childhood resilience was related to early childhood stimulating home environment. Promoting optimal stimulating home environments in low-resource settings to nurture holistic childhood development including mental health is essential.", "Infertility, although not a life-threatening condition, affects around 15% of couples trying for a pregnancy. The increasing availability of large datasets from various sources, together with advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), are enabling a transformational change in infertility care. However, real-world applications of data-driven medicine in infertility care are still relatively limited. At present, very little can prevent infertility from arising; more work is required to learn about ways to improve natural conception and the detection and diagnosis of infertility, improve assisted reproduction treatments (ART) and ultimately develop useful clinical-decision support systems to assure the successful outcome of either fertility preservation or infertility treatment. In this opinion article, we discuss recent influential work on the application of big data and AI in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility. We evaluate the challenges of the sector and present an interpretation of the different innovation forces that are driving the emergence of a systems approach to infertility care. Efforts including the integration of multi-omics information, collection of well-curated biological samples in specialised biobanks, and stimulation of the active participation of patients are considered. In the era of Big Data and AI, there is now an exciting opportunity to leverage the progress in genomics and digital technologies and develop more sophisticated approaches to diagnose and treat infertility disorders.", "Anatomy is taught in the early years of an undergraduate medical curriculum. The subject is volatile and of voluminous content, given the complex nature of the human body. Students frequently face learning constraints in these fledgling years of medical education, often resulting in a spiraling dwindling academic performance. Hence, there have been continued efforts directed at developing new curricula and incorporating new methods of teaching, learning and assessment that are aimed at logical learning and long-term retention of anatomical knowledge, which is a mainstay of all medical practice. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained in popularity. AI uses machine learning models to store, compute, analyze and even augment huge amounts of data to be retrieved when needed, while simultaneously the machine itself can be programmed for deep learning, improving its own efficiency through complex neural networks. There are numerous specific benefits to incorporating AI in education, which include in-depth learning, storage of large electronic data, teaching from remote locations, engagement of fewer personnel in teaching, quick feedback from responders, innovative assessment methods and user-friendly alternatives. AI has long been a part of medical diagnostics and treatment planning. Extensive literature is available on uses of AI in clinical settings, e.g., in Radiology, but to the best of our knowledge there is a paucity of published data on AI used for teaching, learning and assessment in anatomy. In the present review, we highlight recent novel and advanced AI techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), or more complex Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) and Bayesian U-Net, which are used for teaching anatomy. We also address the main advantages and limitations of the use of AI in medical education and lessons learnt from AI application during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, studies with AI in anatomy education could be advantageous for both students to develop professional expertise and for instructors to develop improved teaching methods for this vast and complex subject, especially with the increasing paucity of cadavers in many medical schools. We also suggest some novel examples of how AI could be incorporated to deliver augmented reality experiences, especially with reference to complex regions in the human body, such as neural pathways in the brain, complex developmental processes in the embryo or in complicated miniature regions such as the middle and inner ear. AI can change the face of assessment techniques and broaden their dimensions to suit individual learners.", "Traditional drug design requires a great amount of research time and developmental expense. Booming computational approaches, including computational biology, computer-aided drug design, and artificial intelligence, have the potential to expedite the efficiency of drug discovery by minimizing the time and financial cost. In recent years, computational approaches are being widely used to improve the efficacy and effectiveness of drug discovery and pipeline, leading to the approval of plenty of new drugs for marketing. The present review emphasizes on the applications of these indispensable computational approaches in aiding target identification, lead discovery, and lead optimization. Some challenges of using these approaches for drug design are also discussed. Moreover, we propose a methodology for integrating various computational techniques into new drug discovery and design.", "To develop a new ectasia risk model through artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, enabling the creation of an integrated method without a cut-off point per risk factor, and subsequently better at differentiating patients at higher risk of ectasia with normal topography.\nThis comparative case-control study included 339 eyes with normal preoperative topography, with 65 eyes that developed ectasia after laser in situ keratomileusis (ectasia group) and 274 eyes that did not develop ectasia (control group). The AI model used known risk factors to engineer 14 additional ones, totaling 20 features. In this methodology, no variable is used in isolation because its cut-off point is never considered. All separation between cases and controls is made through the interaction detected by the machine learning model that gathers the variables considered relevant. The ability to correctly separate ectatic cases identified as high risk, ectatic cases wrongly classified as low risk, and controls were illustrated by the diagram t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).\nOnly two original variables (percent tissue altered and corneal thickness) and two derived from the feature engineering process (derivative percent tissue altered and age weighted value) were selected by the final AI model (ie, best performing AI-based model to separate patients at higher risk). The t-SNE visualization demonstrated the greater ability to differentiate between patients considered at risk by the AI-based model, without a cut-off point, compared to all other methods used alone (P < .0001).\nThis study describes a new AI-based model that integrates different risk factors without a cut-off point, increasing the number of cases correctly identified as at higher risk. [J Refract Surg. 2022;38(11):716-724.].", "The testing and evaluation system has been the key technology and security with its necessity in the development and deployment of maturing automated vehicles. In this research, the physics-intelligence hybrid theory-based dynamic scenario library generation method is proposed to improve system performance, in particular, the testing efficiency and accuracy for automated vehicles. A general framework of the dynamic scenario library generation is established. Then, the parameterized scenario based on the dimension optimization method is specified to obtain the effective scenario element set. Long-tail functions for performance testing of specific ODD are constructed as optimization boundaries and critical scenario searching methods are proposed based on the node optimization and sample expansion methods for the low-dimensional scenario library generation and the reinforcement learning for the high-dimensional one, respectively. The scenario library generation method is evaluated with the naturalistic driving data (NDD) of the intelligent electric vehicle in the field test. Results show better efficient and accuracy performances compared with the ideal testing library and the NDD, respectively, in both low- and high-dimensional scenarios.", "Automated image analysis plays an increasing role in radiology in detecting and quantifying image features outside of the perception of human eyes. Common AI-based approaches address a single medical problem, although patients often present with multiple interacting, frequently subclinical medical conditions. A holistic imaging diagnostics tool based on artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential of providing an overview of multi-system comorbidities within a single workflow. An interdisciplinary, multicentric team of medical experts and computer scientists designed a pipeline, comprising AI-based tools for the automated detection, quantification and characterization of the most common pulmonary, metabolic, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal comorbidities in chest computed tomography (CT). To provide a comprehensive evaluation of each patient, a multidimensional workflow was established with algorithms operating synchronously on a decentralized Joined Imaging Platform (JIP). The results of each patient are transferred to a dedicated database and summarized as a structured report with reference to available reference values and annotated sample images of detected pathologies. Hence, this tool allows for the comprehensive, large-scale analysis of imaging-biomarkers of comorbidities in chest CT, first in science and then in clinical routine. Moreover, this tool accommodates the quantitative analysis and classification of each pathology, providing integral diagnostic and prognostic value, and subsequently leading to improved preventive patient care and further possibilities for future studies.", "With its standardized MRI datasets of the entire spine, the German National Cohort (GNC) has the potential to deliver standardized biometric reference values for intervertebral discs (VD), vertebral bodies (VB) and spinal canal (SC). To handle such large-scale big data, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are needed. In this manuscript, we will present an AI software tool to analyze spine MRI and generate normative standard values. 330 representative GNC MRI datasets were randomly selected in equal distribution regarding parameters of age, sex and height. By using a 3D U-Net, an AI algorithm was trained, validated and tested. Finally, the machine learning algorithm explored the full dataset (n = 10,215). VB, VD and SC were successfully segmented and analyzed by using an AI-based algorithm. A software tool was developed to analyze spine-MRI and provide age, sex, and height-matched comparative biometric data. Using an AI algorithm, the reliable segmentation of MRI datasets of the entire spine from the GNC was possible and achieved an excellent agreement with manually segmented datasets. With the analysis of the total GNC MRI dataset with almost 30,000 subjects, it will be possible to generate real normative standard values in the future.", "As a raw material for beer, barley seeds play a critical role in producing beers with various flavors. Unexcepted mixed varieties of barley seeds make malt quality uncontrollable and can even destroy beer flavors. To ensure the quality and flavor of malts and beers, beer brewers will strictly check the appropriate varieties of barley seeds during the malting process. There are wide varieties of barley seeds with small sizes and similar features. Professionals can visually distinguish these varieties, which can be tedious and time-consuming and have high misjudgment rates. However, biological testing requires professional equipment, reagents, and laboratories, which are expensive. This study aims to build an automatic artificial intelligence detection method to achieve high performance in multi-barley seed datasets. There are nine varieties of barley seeds (CDC Copeland, AC Metcalfe, Hockett, Scarlett, Expedition, AAC Synergy, Celebration, Legacy, and Tradition). We captured images of these original barley seeds using an iPhone 11 Pro. This study used two mixed datasets, including a single-barley seed dataset and a multi-barley seed dataset, to improve the detection accuracy of multi-barley seeds. The multi-barley seed dataset had random amounts and varieties of barley seeds in each image. The single-barley seed dataset had one barley seed in each image. Data augmentation can reduce overfitting and maximize model performance and accuracy. Multi-variety barley seed recognition deploys an efficient data augmentation method to effectively expand the barley dataset. After adjusting the hyperparameters of the networks and analyzing and augmenting the datasets, the YOLOv5 series network was the most effective in training the two barley seed datasets and achieved the highest performance. The YOLOv5x6 network achieved the second highest performance. The mAP (mean Average Precision) of the trained YOLOv5x6 was 97.5%; precision was 98.4%; recall was 98.1%; the average speed of image detection reached 0.024 s. YOLOv5x6 only trained the multi-barley seed dataset; the trained performance was greater than that of the YOLOv5 series. The two datasets had 39.5% higher precision, 27.1% higher recall, and 40.1% higher mAP than when just using the original multi-barley seed dataset. The multi-barley seed detection results showed high performance, robustness, and speed. Therefore, malting and brewing industries can assess the original barley seed quality with the assistance of fast, intelligent, and detected multi-barley seed images.", "Background: The planetary rover is an essential platform for planetary exploration. Visual semantic segmentation is significant in the localization, perception, and path planning of the rover autonomy. Recent advances in computer vision and artificial intelligence brought about new opportunities. A systematic literature review (SLR) can help analyze existing solutions, discover available data, and identify potential gaps. Methods: A rigorous SLR has been conducted, and papers are selected from three databases (IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and Scopus) from the start of records to May 2022. The 320 candidate studies were found by searching with keywords and bool operators, and they address the semantic terrain segmentation in the navigation vision of planetary rovers. Finally, after four rounds of screening, 30 papers were included with robust inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as quality assessment. Results: 30 studies were included for the review, and sub-research areas include navigation (16 studies), geological analysis (7 studies), exploration efficiency (10 studies), and others (3 studies) (overlaps exist). Five distributions are extendedly depicted (time, study type, geographical location, publisher, and experimental setting), which analyzes the included study from the view of community interests, development status, and reimplementation ability. One key research question and six sub-research questions are discussed to evaluate the current achievements and future gaps. Conclusions: Many promising achievements in accuracy, available data, and real-time performance have been promoted by computer vision and artificial intelligence. However, a solution that satisfies pixel-level segmentation, real-time inference time, and onboard hardware does not exist, and an open, pixel-level annotated, and the real-world data-based dataset is not found. As planetary exploration projects progress worldwide, more promising studies will be proposed, and deep learning will bring more opportunities and contributions to future studies. Contributions: This SLR identifies future gaps and challenges by proposing a methodical, replicable, and transparent survey, which is the first review (also the first SLR) for semantic terrain segmentation in the navigation vision of planetary rovers.", "Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a physical activity metric that translates heart rate during physical activity into a simple score, where a weekly score of 100 or greater is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Here, we prospectively investigated the association between PAI and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality in a large healthy population from China.\nUsing data from the China Kadoorie Biobank, we studied 443,792 healthy adults (60% women). The weekly PAI score of each participant was estimated based on the questionnaire data and divided into four groups (PAI scores of 0, \u226450, 51-99, or \u2265100). Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for fatal IHD and nonfatal myocardial infraction (MI) related to PAI were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses.\nThere were 3050 IHD deaths and 1808 MI events during a median follow-up of 8.2 years (interquartile range, 7.3-9.1; 3.6 million person-years). After adjustments for multiple confounders, a weekly PAI score \u2265 100 was associated with a lower risk of IHD (aHR: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.83-1.00)), compared with the inactive group (0 PAI). The corresponding aHR for MI was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.83-1.05). In participants aged 60 years or older at baseline, the aHR associated with a weekly PAI score \u2265 100 was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.75-0.93) for IHD and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.73-0.98) for MI.\nAmong healthy Chinese adults, a weekly PAI score of 100 or greater was associated with a lower risk of IHD mortality across all age groups; moreover, a high PAI score significantly lowered the risk of MI but only in those 60 years and older at baseline. The present findings extend the scientific evidence that PAI may have prognostic significance in diverse settings for IHD outcomes and suggest that the PAI metric may be useful in delineating the magnitude of weekly physical activity needed to reduce the risk of IHD mortality.", "The assessment of the knee alignment using standing weight-bearing full-leg radiographs (FLR) is a standardized method. Determining the load-bearing axis of the leg requires time-consuming manual measurements. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a novel algorithm based on artificial intelligence (AI) for the automated assessment of lower limb alignment. In the first stage, a customized mask-RCNN model was trained to automatically detect and segment anatomical structures and implants in FLR. In the second stage, four region-specific neural network models (adaptations of UNet) were trained to automatically place anatomical landmarks. In the final stage, this information was used to automatically determine five key lower limb alignment angles. For the validation dataset, weight-bearing, antero-posterior FLR were captured preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Preoperative images were measured by the operating orthopedic surgeon and an independent physician. Postoperative images were measured by the second rater only. The final validation dataset consisted of 95 preoperative and 105 postoperative FLR. The detection rate for the different angles ranged between 92.4% and 98.9%. Human vs. human inter-(ICCs: 0.85\u22120.99) and intra-rater (ICCs: 0.95\u22121.0) reliability analysis achieved significant agreement. The ICC-values of human vs. AI inter-rater reliability analysis ranged between 0.8 and 1.0 preoperatively and between 0.83 and 0.99 postoperatively (all p < 0.001). An independent and external validation of the proposed algorithm on pre- and postoperative FLR, with excellent reliability for human measurements, could be demonstrated. Hence, the algorithm might allow for the objective and time saving analysis of large datasets and support physicians in daily routine.", "As a precision mechanical component to reduce friction between components, the rolling bearing is widely used in many fields because of its slight friction loss, strong bearing capacity, high precision, low power consumption, and high mechanical efficiency. This paper reviews several excellent kinds of study and their relevance to the fault detection of rolling bearings. We summarize the fault location, sensor types, bearing fault types, and fault signal analysis of rolling bearings. The fault signal types are divided into one-dimensional and two-dimensional images, which account for 40.14% and 31.69%, respectively, and their classification is clarified and discussed. We counted the proportions of various methods in the references cited in this paper. Among them, the method of one-dimensional signal detection with external sensors accounted for 3.52%, the method of one-dimensional signal detection with internal sensors accounted for 36.62%, and the method of two-dimensional signal detection with external sensors accounted for 19.72%. The method of two-dimensional signal detection with internal sensors accounted for 11.97%. Among these methods, the highest detection rate is 100%, and the lowest detection rate is more than 70%. The similarities between the different methods are compared. The research results summarized in this paper show that with the progress of the times, a variety of new and better research methods have emerged, which have sped up the detection and diagnosis of rolling bearing faults. For example, the technology using artificial intelligence is still developing rapidly, such as artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and machine learning. Although there are still defects, such methods can quickly discover a fault and its cause, enrich the database, and accumulate experience. More and more advanced techniques are applied in this field, and the detection method has better robustness and superiority.", "The Strawberry Advisory System (SAS) is a tool developed to help Florida strawberry growers determine the risk of common fungal diseases and the need for fungicide applications. Leaf wetness duration (LWD) is one of the important parameters in SAS disease risk modeling. By accurately measuring the LWD, disease risk can be better assessed, leading to less fungicide use and more economic benefits to the farmers. This research aimed to develop and test a more accurate leaf wetness detection system than traditional leaf wetness sensors. In this research, a leaf wetness detection system was developed and tested using color imaging of a reference surface and a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the artificial-intelligence-based learning methods. The system was placed at two separate field locations during the 2021-2022 strawberry-growing season. The results from the developed system were compared against manual observation to determine the accuracy of the system. It was found that the AI- and imaging-based system had high accuracy in detecting wetness on a reference surface. The developed system can be used in SAS for determining accurate disease risks and fungicide recommendations for strawberry production and allows the expansion of the system to multiple locations.", "Before Chuna manual therapy (CMT), a manual therapy applied in Korean medicine, CMT spinal diagnosis using palpation or X-ray is performed. However, studies on the inter-rater concordance of CMT diagnostic methods, concordance among diagnostic methods, and standard CMT diagnostic methods are scarce. Moreover, no clinical studies have used artificial intelligence (AI) programs for X-ray image-based CMT diagnosis. Therefore, this study sought a feasible and standard CMT spinal diagnostic method and explored the clinical applicability of the CMT-AI program. One hundred participants were recruited, and the concordance within and among different diagnostic modalities was analyzed by dividing them into manual diagnosis (MD), X-ray image-based diagnosis (XRD) by experts and non-experts, and XRD using a CMT-AI program by non-experts. Regarding intra-group concordance, XRD by experts showed the highest concordance (used as a gold standard when comparing inter-group concordance), followed by XRD using the AI program, XRD by non-experts, and then MD. Comparing diagnostic results between the groups, concordance with the gold standard was the highest for XRD using the AI program, followed by XRD by non-experts, and MD. Therefore, XRD is a more reasonable CMT diagnostic method than MD. Furthermore, the clinical applicability of the CMT-AI program is high.", "The aim of this study was to explore how the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which contact communication was severely restricted, changed psychological health indicators, such as subjective assessment of health and depression, impulsivity, stress and emotional intelligence (EI) and how that depended on age, gender, physical activity (PA), sports specificity and body mass index (BMI).We surveyed 6369 before and 2392 people during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were aged 18-74 years. Participants completed the Danish Physical Activity Questionnaire (DPAQ), the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSREIT), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale Version 11 (BIS-11), subjective depression and health self-assessments. One-way and two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed to assess the effect of independent variables on the dependent variables of MVPA (METs). Statistical analysis showed that restrictions during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic did not alter moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), except for a significant decrease in MVPA in women aged 18-25 years, or body mass index in women and men of different ages. An increase in depression and impulsivity was observed, especially an increase in unplanned or spontaneous activity. The restrictions during the first wave increased stress in women of all ages and, rather unexpectedly, improved health self-assessment in men.The study showed that the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic affected people's subjective assessment of health, depression, stress and impulsivity in two ways: it \"weakened the weak ones\" and \"strengthened the strong ones\".", "In medical practice, chest X-rays are the most ubiquitous diagnostic imaging tests. However, the current workload in extensive health care facilities and lack of well-trained radiologists is a significant challenge in the patient care pathway. Therefore, an accurate, reliable, and fast computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system capable of detecting abnormalities in chest X-rays is crucial in improving the radiological workflow. In this prospective multicenter quality-improvement study, we have evaluated whether artificial intelligence (AI) can be used as a chest X-ray screening tool in real clinical settings. Methods: A team of radiologists used the AI-based chest X-ray screening tool (qXR) as a part of their daily reporting routine to report consecutive chest X-rays for this prospective multicentre study. This study took place in a large radiology network in India between June 2021 and March 2022. Results: A total of 65,604 chest X-rays were processed during the study period. The overall performance of AI achieved in detecting normal and abnormal chest X-rays was good. The high negatively predicted value (NPV) of 98.9% was achieved. The AI performance in terms of area under the curve (AUC), NPV for the corresponding subabnormalities obtained were blunted CP angle (0.97, 99.5%), hilar dysmorphism (0.86, 99.9%), cardiomegaly (0.96, 99.7%), reticulonodular pattern (0.91, 99.9%), rib fracture (0.98, 99.9%), scoliosis (0.98, 99.9%), atelectasis (0.96, 99.9%), calcification (0.96, 99.7%), consolidation (0.95, 99.6%), emphysema (0.96, 99.9%), fibrosis (0.95, 99.7%), nodule (0.91, 99.8%), opacity (0.92, 99.2%), pleural effusion (0.97, 99.7%), and pneumothorax (0.99, 99.9%). Additionally, the turnaround time (TAT) decreased by about 40.63% from pre-qXR period to post-qXR period. Conclusions: The AI-based chest X-ray solution (qXR) screened chest X-rays and assisted in ruling out normal patients with high confidence, thus allowing the radiologists to focus more on assessing pathology on abnormal chest X-rays and treatment pathways.", "Lung cancer is one of the malignancies with higher morbidity and mortality. Imaging plays an essential role in each phase of lung cancer management, from detection to assessment of response to treatment. The development of imaging-based artificial intelligence (AI) models has the potential to play a key role in early detection and customized treatment planning. Computer-aided detection of lung nodules in screening programs has revolutionized the early detection of the disease. Moreover, the possibility to use AI approaches to identify patients at risk of developing lung cancer during their life can help a more targeted screening program. The combination of imaging features and clinical and laboratory data through AI models is giving promising results in the prediction of patients' outcomes, response to specific therapies, and risk for toxic reaction development. In this review, we provide an overview of the main imaging AI-based tools in lung cancer imaging, including automated lesion detection, characterization, segmentation, prediction of outcome, and treatment response to provide radiologists and clinicians with the foundation for these applications in a clinical scenario.", "Artificial intelligence has been widely used in the field of dentistry in recent years. The present study highlights current advances and limitations in integrating artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in subfields of dentistry including periodontology, endodontics, orthodontics, restorative dentistry, and oral pathology. This article aims to provide a systematic review of current clinical applications of artificial intelligence within different fields of dentistry. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews (PRISMA) statement was used as a formal guideline for data collection. Data was obtained from research studies for 2009-2022. The analysis included a total of 55 papers from Google Scholar, IEEE, PubMed, and Scopus databases. Results show that artificial intelligence has the potential to improve dental care, disease diagnosis and prognosis, treatment planning, and risk assessment. Finally, this study highlights the limitations of the analyzed studies and provides future directions to improve dental care.", "In recent years, the study of dyslexia has seen rapid progress in definition and classification, neuropsychological correlates, neurobiological factors, and intervention. However, there are few studies on how virtual reality can affect improving cognitive domains and cross-cutting pedagogical skills. We, therefore, tested intervention through the use of a virtual reality rehabilitation system (VRRS) in children with dyslexia. Twenty-eight patients diagnosed with dyslexia were enrolled in this study. One-half underwent conventional neuropsychological treatment, and the other half performed VR neurorehabilitation training using the VRRS. All patients were evaluated by neuropsychological assessment at baseline (T0) and at the end of the protocol (T1). The assessment included the administration of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV and the Italian Battery for the Assessment of Dyslexia and Dysorthography. Our results showed a significant difference in word-reading test scores as well as in homophonic writing. In addition, treatment type was found to affect some domains of the WISC. We believe that the VRRS led to improved outcomes through the use of VR, which encourages active exploration, improves engagement, and provides motivation and enjoyment, allowing longer training sessions and improving treatment adherence.", "Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved the oncological outcomes, about one-third of patients affected by clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) still experience recurrence. Current prognostic algorithms, such as the Leibovich score (LS), rely on morphological features manually assessed by pathologists and are therefore subject to bias. Moreover, these tools do not consider the heterogeneous molecular milieu present in the Tumour Microenvironment (TME), which may have prognostic value. We systematically developed a semi-automated method to investigate 62 markers and their combinations in 150 primary ccRCCs using Multiplex Immunofluorescence (mIF), NanoString GeoMx\u00ae Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted image analysis in order to find novel prognostic signatures and investigate their spatial relationship. We found that coexpression of cancer stem cell (CSC) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers such as OCT4 and ZEB1 are indicative of poor outcome. OCT4 and the immune markers CD8, CD34, and CD163 significantly stratified patients at intermediate LS. Furthermore, augmenting the LS with OCT4 and CD34 improved patient stratification by outcome. Our results support the hypothesis that combining molecular markers has prognostic value and can be integrated with morphological features to improve risk stratification and personalised therapy. To conclude, GeoMx\u00ae DSP and AI image analysis are complementary tools providing high multiplexing capability required to investigate the TME of ccRCC, while reducing observer bias.", "Contrast media are widely diffused in biomedical imaging, due to their relevance in the diagnosis of numerous disorders. However, the risk of adverse reactions, the concern of potential damage to sensitive organs, and the recently described brain deposition of gadolinium salts, limit the use of contrast media in clinical practice. In recent years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to biomedical imaging has led to the development of 'virtual' and 'augmented' contrasts. The idea behind these applications is to generate synthetic post-contrast images through AI computational modeling starting from the information available on other images acquired during the same scan. In these AI models, non-contrast images (virtual contrast) or low-dose post-contrast images (augmented contrast) are used as input data to generate synthetic post-contrast images, which are often undistinguishable from the native ones. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances of AI applications to biomedical imaging relative to synthetic contrast media.", "Covid-19 has been a global concern since 2019, crippling the world economy and health. Biological diagnostic tools have since been developed to identify the virus from bodily fluids and since the virus causes pneumonia, which results in lung inflammation, the presence of the virus can also be detected using medical imaging by expert radiologists. The success of each diagnostic method is measured by the hit rate for identifying Covid infections. However, the access for people to each diagnosis tool can be limited, depending on the geographic region and, since Covid treatment denotes a race against time, the diagnosis duration plays an important role. Hospitals with X-ray opportunities are widely distributed all over the world, so a method investigating lung X-ray images for possible Covid-19 infections would offer itself. Promising results have been achieved in the literature in automatically detecting the virus using medical images like CT scans and X-rays using supervised artificial neural network algorithms. One of the major drawbacks of supervised learning models is that they require enormous amounts of data to train, and generalize on new data. In this study, we develop a Swish activated, Instance and Batch normalized Residual U-Net GAN with dense blocks and skip connections to create synthetic and augmented data for training. The proposed GAN architecture, due to the presence of instance normalization and swish activation, can deal with the randomness of luminosity, that arises due to different sources of X-ray images better than the classical architecture and generate realistic-looking synthetic data. Also, the radiology equipment is not generally computationally efficient. They cannot efficiently run state-of-the-art deep neural networks such as DenseNet and ResNet effectively. Hence, we propose a novel CNN architecture that is 40% lighter and more accurate than state-of-the-art CNN networks. Multi-class classification of the three classes of chest X-rays (CXR), ie Covid-19, healthy and Pneumonia, is performed using the proposed model which had an extremely high test accuracy of 99.2% which has not been achieved in any previous studies in the literature. Based on the mentioned criteria for developing Corona infection diagnosis, in the present study, an Artificial Intelligence based method is proposed, resulting in a rapid diagnostic tool for Covid infections based on generative adversarial and convolutional neural networks. The benefit will be a high accuracy of lung infection identification with 99% accuracy. This could lead to a support tool that helps in rapid diagnosis, and an accessible Covid identification method using CXR images.", "As the key of human-computer natural interaction, the research of emotion recognition is of great significance to the development of computer intelligence. In view of the issue that the current emotional feature dimension is too high, which affects the classification performance, this paper proposes a modified ReliefF feature selection algorithm to screen out feature subsets with smaller dimensions and better performance from high-dimensional features to further improve the efficiency and accuracy of emotion recognition. In the modified algorithm, the selection range of random samples is adjusted; the correlation between features is measured by the maximum information coefficient, and the distance measurement method between samples is established based on the correlation. The experimental results on the eNTERFACE'05 and SAVEE speech emotional datasets show that the features filtered based on the modified algorithm significantly reduce the data dimensions and effectively improve the accuracy of emotion recognition.", "Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is the gold standard for diagnosis of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The semi-quantitative MRCP-derived Anali scores proposed for risk stratification, have poor-to-moderate inter-reader agreement.\nTo evaluate the prognostic performance of quantitative MRCP metrics in PSC.\nThis is a retrospective study of PSC patients undergoing MRCP. Images were processed using MRCP+ software (Perspectum Ltd, Oxford) that provides quantitative biliary features, semi-automatically extracted by artificial intelligence-driven analysis of MRCP-3D images. The prognostic value of biliary features has been assessed for all hepato-biliary complications.\n87 PSC patients have been included in the analysis. Median follow-up from MRCP to event/censoring of 30.9 months (Q1-Q3=13.6-46.6). An adverse outcome occurred in 27 (31.0%) patients. The number of biliary strictures (HR=1.05 per unit, 95%CI 1.02-1.08, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), spleen length (HR=1.16 per cm, 95%CI 1.01-1.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.039), adjusted for height, age at MRCP, and time from diagnosis to MRCP predicted higher risk of hepatobiliary complications. These were incorporated into a the quantitative MRCP-derived PSC (qMRCP-PSC) score (C-statistic=0.80). After 3-fold cross-validation, qMRCP-PSC outperformed the Anali score in our cohort (C-statistic of 0.78\u00a0vs 0.64) and enabled the discrimination of survival of PSC patients (log-rank p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).\nThe qMRCP-PSC score identified patients at higher risk of hepatobiliary complications and outperformed the available radiological scores. It represents a novel quantitative biomarker for disease monitoring and a potential surrogate endpoint for clinical trials.", "(1) Background: AI-based solutions could become crucial for the prediction of pregnancy disorders and complications. This study investigated the evidence for applying artificial intelligence methods in obstetric pregnancy risk assessment and adverse pregnancy outcome prediction. (2) Methods: Authors screened the following databases: Pubmed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. This study included all the evaluative studies comparing artificial intelligence methods in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes. The PROSPERO ID number is CRD42020178944, and the study protocol was published before this publication. (3) Results: AI application was found in nine groups: general pregnancy risk assessment, prenatal diagnosis, pregnancy hypertension disorders, fetal growth, stillbirth, gestational diabetes, preterm deliveries, delivery route, and others. According to this systematic review, the best artificial intelligence application for assessing medical conditions is ANN methods. The average accuracy of ANN methods was established to be around 80-90%. (4) Conclusions: The application of AI methods as a digital software can help medical practitioners in their everyday practice during pregnancy risk assessment. Based on published studies, models that used ANN methods could be applied in APO prediction. Nevertheless, further studies could identify new methods with an even better prediction potential.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology in healthcare and holds the potential to disrupt many arms in medical care. In particular, disciplines using medical imaging modalities, including e.g. radiology but ophthalmology as well, are already confronted with a wide variety of AI implications. In ophthalmologic research, AI has demonstrated promising results limited to specific diseases and imaging tools, respectively. Yet, implementation of AI in clinical routine is not widely spread due to availability, heterogeneity in imaging techniques and AI methods. In order to describe the status quo, this narrational review provides a brief introduction to AI (\"what the ophthalmologist needs to know\"), followed by an overview of different AI-based applications in ophthalmology and a discussion on future challenges.Abbreviations: Age-related macular degeneration, AMD; Artificial intelligence, AI; Anterior segment OCT, AS-OCT; Coronary artery calcium score, CACS; Convolutional neural network, CNN; Deep convolutional neural network, DCNN; Diabetic retinopathy, DR; Machine learning, ML; Optical coherence tomography, OCT; Retinopathy of prematurity, ROP; Support vector machine, SVM; Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, TAO.", "Mobile applications are increasingly used in healthcare. We have developed a smartphone healthcare application, CALO mama Plus, that can register daily diet, exercise, mood, and sleep quality, calculate dietary intake, and provide advice using artificial intelligence technology. This 3-month randomized controlled trial tested the hypothesis that CALO mama Plus could promote body weight reduction in Japanese adults with overweight or obesity. We recruited office workers as participants. The key eligibility criteria were an age of 20-65 years and a body mass index of 23-40 kg/m2. The primary outcome was body weight change over 3 months. We enrolled 141 participants and randomly assigned them to the intervention (n = 72) and control (n = 69) groups. The intervention group used CALO mama Plus, and the control group did not receive any intervention. The change in body weight was -2.4 \u00b1 4.0 kg and -0.7 \u00b1 3.3 kg in the intervention and control groups, respectively. An analysis of covariance adjusted for related variables showed a significant between-group difference in body weight change (-1.60 kg; 95% confidence interval -2.83 to -0.38; p = 0.011). The present study suggests that CALO mama Plus effectively promotes weight loss.", "Benchmarks are crucial to measuring and steering progress in artificial intelligence (AI). However, recent studies raised concerns over the state of AI benchmarking, reporting issues such as benchmark overfitting, benchmark saturation and increasing centralization of benchmark dataset creation. To facilitate monitoring of the health of the AI benchmarking ecosystem, we introduce methodologies for creating condensed maps of the global dynamics of benchmark creation and saturation. We curate data for 3765 benchmarks covering the entire domains of computer vision and natural language processing, and show that a large fraction of benchmarks quickly trends towards near-saturation, that many benchmarks fail to find widespread utilization, and that benchmark performance gains for different AI tasks are prone to unforeseen bursts. We analyze attributes associated with benchmark popularity, and conclude that future benchmarks should emphasize versatility, breadth and real-world utility.", "Recently, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) under the umbrella of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart cities and emerging communities have become the focus of the academic and industrial science community. On this basis, UAVs have been used in many military and commercial systems as emergency transport and air support during natural disasters and epidemics. In such previous scenarios, boosting wireless signals in remote or isolated areas would need a mobile signal booster placed on UAVs, and, at the same time, the data would be secured by a secure decentralized database. This paper contributes to investigating the possibility of using a wireless repeater placed on a UAV as a mobile booster for weak wireless signals in isolated or rural areas in emergency situations and that the transmitted information is protected from external interference and manipulation. The working mechanism is as follows: one of the UAVs detect a human presence in a predetermined area with the thermal camera and then directs the UAVs to the location to enhance the weak signal and protect the transmitted data. The methodology of localization and clusterization of the UAVs is represented by a swarm intelligence localization (SIL) optimization algorithm. At the same time, the information sent by UAV is protected by blockchain technology as a decentralization database. According to realistic studies and analyses of UAVs localization and clusterization, the proposed idea can improve the amplitude of the wireless signals in far regions. In comparison, this database technique is difficult to attack. The research ultimately supports emergency transport networks, blockchain, and IoT services.", "Water pollution is caused by multiple factors, such as industrial dye wastewater. Dye-contaminated water can be treated using hydrogels as adsorbent materials. Recently, composite hydrogels containing metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) have been used extensively in wastewater remediation. In this study, we use a statistical and artificial intelligence method, based on principal component analysis (PCA) with different applied parameters, to evaluate the adsorption efficiency of 27 different MONP composite hydrogels for wastewater dye treatment. PCA showed that the hydrogel composites CTS@Fe3O4, PAAm/TiO2, and PEGDMA-rGO/Fe3O4@cellulose should be used in situations involving high pH, time to reach equilibrium, and adsorption capacity. However, as the composites PAAm-co-AAc/TiO2, PVPA/Fe3O4@SiO2, PMOA/ATP/Fe3O4, and PVPA/Fe3O4@SiO2, are preferred when all physical and chemical properties investigated have low magnitudes. To conclude, PCA is a strong method for highlighting the essential factors affecting hydrogel composite selection for dye-contaminated water treatment.", "Artificial intelligence is finding several applications in healthcare settings. This study aimed to report evidence on the effectiveness of artificial intelligence application in obstetrics. Through a narrative review of literature, we described artificial intelligence use in different obstetrical areas as follows: prenatal diagnosis, fetal heart monitoring, prediction and management of pregnancy-related complications (preeclampsia, preterm birth, gestational diabetes mellitus, and placenta accreta spectrum), and labor. Artificial intelligence seems to be a promising tool to help clinicians in daily clinical activity. The main advantages that emerged from this review are related to the reduction of inter- and intraoperator variability, time reduction of procedures, and improvement of overall diagnostic performance. However, nowadays, the diffusion of these systems in routine clinical practice raises several issues. Reported evidence is still very limited, and further studies are needed to confirm the clinical applicability of artificial intelligence. Moreover, better training of clinicians designed to use these systems should be ensured, and evidence-based guidelines regarding this topic should be produced to enhance the strengths of artificial systems and minimize their limits.", "The \"digital era\" in the field of medicine is the new \"here and now\". Artificial intelligence has entered many fields of medicine and is recently emerging in the field of organ transplantation. Solid organs remain a scarce resource. Being able to predict the outcome after liver transplantation promises to solve one of the long-standing problems within organ transplantation. What is the perfect donor recipient match? Within this work we developed and validated a novel deep-learning-based donor-recipient allocation system for liver transplantation.\nIn this study we used data collected from all liver transplant patients between 2004 and 2019 at the university transplantation centre in Munich. We aimed to design a transparent and interpretable deep learning framework to predict the outcome after liver transplantation. An individually designed neural network was developed to meet the unique requirements of transplantation data. The metrics used to determine the model quality and its level of performance are accuracy, cross-entropy loss, and F1 score as well as AUC score.\nA total of 529 transplantations with a total of 1058 matching donor and recipient observations were added into the database. The combined prediction of all outcome parameters was 95.8% accurate (cross-entropy loss of 0.042). The prediction of death within the hospital was 94.3% accurate (cross-entropy loss of 0.057). The overall F1 score was 0.899 on average, whereas the overall AUC score was 0.940.\nWith the achieved results, the network serves as a reliable tool to predict survival. It adds new insight into the potential of deep learning to assist medical decisions. Especially in the field of transplantation, an AUC Score of 94% is very valuable. This neuronal network is unique as it utilizes transparent and easily interpretable data to predict the outcome after liver transplantation. Further validation must be performed prior to utilization in a clinical context.", "Wake-up stroke (WUS) is a type of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) that occurs during sleep with unknown time of symptom onset. The best treatment is usually not suitable for WUS, as thrombolysis is usually provided to patients who had a symptomatic AIS within a definite 4.5\u2009hours, and WUS remains a therapeutic quandary. Efforts to explore the onset time characteristics of patients who had a WUS and the risk factors affecting poor prognosis support a role for providing new insights by performing multicentre cohort study.\nThis multicentre, nationwide prospective registry will include 21 comprehensive stroke centres, with a goal of recruiting 550 patients who had a WUS in China. In this study, clinical data including patient's clinical characteristics, stroke onset time, imaging findings, therapeutic interventions and prognosis (the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score and the modified Rankin Scale Score at different time points) will be used to develop prediction models for stroke onset time and prognostic evaluation using the fast-processing of ischemic stroke software. The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors influencing prognosis, to investigate the relationship between the time when the symptoms are found and the actual onset time and to establish an artificial intelligence-based model to predict the prognosis of patients who had a WUS.\nThis study is approved by the ethics committee of Shanghai Pudong Hospital (Shanghai, China) and rest of all participating centres. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.\nChiCTR2100049133.", "In recent years, more and more single-cell technologies have been developed. A vast amount of single-cell omics data has been generated by large projects, such as the Human Cell Atlas, the Mouse Cell Atlas, the Mouse RNA Atlas, the Mouse ATAC Atlas, and the Plant Cell Atlas. Based on these single-cell big data, thousands of bioinformatics algorithms for quality control, clustering, cell-type annotation, developmental inference, cell-cell transition, cell-cell interaction, and spatial analysis are developed. With powerful experimental single-cell technology and state-of-the-art big data analysis methods based on artificial intelligence, the molecular landscape at the single-cell level can be revealed. With spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multi-omics, even the spatial dynamic multi-level regulatory mechanisms can be deciphered. Such single-cell technologies have many successful applications in oncology, assisted reproduction, embryonic development, and plant breeding. We not only review the experimental and bioinformatics methods for single-cell research, but also discuss their applications in various fields and forecast the future directions for single-cell technologies. We believe that spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multi-omics will become the next booming business for mechanism research and commercial industry.", "Great advances have been made in human health care in the application of radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) in a variety of areas, ranging from hospital management and virtual assistants to remote patient monitoring and medical diagnostics and imaging. To improve accuracy and reproducibility, there has been a recent move to integrate radiomics and AI as tools to assist clinical decision making and to incorporate it into routine clinical workflows and diagnosis. Although lagging behind human medicine, the use of radiomics and AI in veterinary diagnostic imaging is becoming more frequent with an increasing number of reported applications. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of current radiomic and AI applications in veterinary diagnostic imaging.", "Examine how different trajectories of reported sleep duration associate with early childhood cognition.\nCaregiver-reported sleep duration data (n\u2005=\u2005330) were collected using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months and Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire at 54 months. Multiple group-based day-, night-, and/or total sleep trajectories were derived-each differing in duration and variability. Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (Bayley-III) and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test- 2 (KBIT-2) were used to assess cognition at 24 and 54 months, respectively.\nCompared to short variable night sleep trajectory, long consistent night sleep trajectory was associated with higher scores on Bayley-III (cognition and language), while moderate/long consistent night sleep trajectories were associated with higher KBIT-2 (verbal and composite) scores. Children with a long consistent total sleep trajectory had higher Bayley-III (cognition and expressive language) and KBIT-2 (verbal and composite) scores compared to children with a short variable total sleep trajectory. Moderate consistent total sleep trajectory was associated with higher Bayley-III language and KBIT-2 verbal scores relative to the short variable total trajectory. Children with a long variable day sleep had lower Bayley-III (cognition and fine motor) and KBIT-2 (verbal and composite) scores compared to children with a short consistent day sleep trajectory.\nLonger and more consistent night- and total sleep trajectories, and a short day sleep trajectory in early childhood were associated with better cognition at 2 and 4.5 years.", "In the last few years, artificial intelligence has shown a lot of promise in the medical domain for the diagnosis and classification of human infections. Several computerized techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) have been introduced in the literature for gastrointestinal (GIT) diseases such as ulcer, bleeding, polyp, and a few others. Manual diagnosis of these infections is time consuming, expensive, and always requires an expert. As a result, computerized methods that can assist doctors as a second opinion in clinics are widely required. The key challenges of a computerized technique are accurate infected region segmentation because each infected region has a change of shape and location. Moreover, the inaccurate segmentation affects the accurate feature extraction that later impacts the classification accuracy. In this paper, we proposed an automated framework for GIT disease segmentation and classification based on deep saliency maps and Bayesian optimal deep learning feature selection. The proposed framework is made up of a few key steps, from preprocessing to classification. Original images are improved in the preprocessing step by employing a proposed contrast enhancement technique. In the following step, we proposed a deep saliency map for segmenting infected regions. The segmented regions are then used to train a pre-trained fine-tuned model called MobileNet-V2 using transfer learning. The fine-tuned model's hyperparameters were initialized using Bayesian optimization (BO). The average pooling layer is then used to extract features. However, several redundant features are discovered during the analysis phase and must be removed. As a result, we proposed a hybrid whale optimization algorithm for selecting the best features. Finally, the selected features are classified using an extreme learning machine classifier. The experiment was carried out on three datasets: Kvasir 1, Kvasir 2, and CUI Wah. The proposed framework achieved accuracy of 98.20, 98.02, and 99.61% on these three datasets, respectively. When compared to other methods, the proposed framework shows an improvement in accuracy.", "What inductive biases must be incorporated into multi-agent artificial intelligence models to get them to capture high-fidelity imitation? We think very little is needed. In the right environments, both instrumental- and ritual-stance imitation can emerge from generic learning mechanisms operating on non-deliberative decision architectures. In this view, imitation emerges from trial-and-error learning and does not require explicit deliberation.", "Diabetic foot syndrome is a multifactorial pathology with at least three main etiological factors, i.e., peripheral neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease, and infection. In addition to complexity, another distinctive trait of diabetic foot syndrome is its insidiousness, due to a frequent lack of early symptoms. In recent years, it has become clear that the prevalence of diabetic foot syndrome is increasing, and it is among the diabetes complications with a stronger impact on patient's quality of life. Considering the complex nature of this syndrome, artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies appear adequate to address aspects such as timely screening for the identification of the risk for foot ulcers (or, even worse, for amputation), based on appropriate sensor technologies. In this review, we summarize the main findings of the pertinent studies in the field, paying attention to both the AI-based methodological aspects and the main physiological/clinical study outcomes. The analyzed studies show that AI application to data derived by different technologies provides promising results, but in our opinion future studies may benefit from inclusion of quantitative measures based on simple sensors, which are still scarcely exploited.", "Assisted reproductive technology (ART) has progressed rapidly, resulting in a great improvement in the clinical pregnancy ratio. When applying the protocol of piezo intracytoplasmic sperm injection (Piezo-ICSI), it is very important to puncture the zona pellucida and the oocyte cytoplasmic membrane without rupturing the oocyte cytoplasmic membrane. Previous studies have shown that the poor extensibility of the oocyte cytoplasmic membrane might be closely related to rupture. However, no consensus has been reached regarding how the quality of the oocyte for extensible ability or rupture possibility affects the surfaces of the oocyte on the microscopic frames. We conducted this study to provide evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are superior for predicting the tendency of oocyte rupture before puncturing on Piezo-ICSI. To inspect it, we provided a retrospective trial of 38 rupture oocytes and 55 nonruptured oocytes. This study marked the highest accuracy of 91.4% for predicting oocytes rupture using the support-vector machine method of machine learning. We conclude that AI technologies might serve an important role and provide a significant benefit to ART.", "Hepatocellular carcinoma ranks fifth amongst the most common malignancies and is the third most common cause of cancer-related death globally. Artificial Intelligence is a rapidly growing field of interest. Following the PRISMA reporting guidelines, we conducted a systematic review to retrieve articles reporting the application of AI in HCC detection and characterization. A total of 27 articles were included and analyzed with our composite score for the evaluation of the quality of the publications. The contingency table reported a statistically significant constant improvement over the years of the total quality score (p = 0.004). Different AI methods have been adopted in the included articles correlated with 19 articles studying CT (41.30%), 20 studying US (43.47%), and 7 studying MRI (15.21%). No article has discussed the use of artificial intelligence in PET and X-ray technology. Our systematic approach has shown that previous works in HCC detection and characterization have assessed the comparability of conventional interpretation with machine learning using US, CT, and MRI. The distribution of the imaging techniques in our analysis reflects the usefulness and evolution of medical imaging for the diagnosis of HCC. Moreover, our results highlight an imminent need for data sharing in collaborative data repositories to minimize unnecessary repetition and wastage of resources.", "Noise is a basic ingredient in data, since observed data are always contaminated by unwanted deviations, i.e., noise, which, in the case of overdetermined systems (with more data than model parameters), cause the corresponding linear system of equations to have an imperfect solution. In addition, in the case of highly underdetermined parameterization, noise can be absorbed by the model, generating spurious solutions. This is a very undesirable situation that might lead to incorrect conclusions. We presented mathematical formalism based on the inverse problem theory combined with artificial intelligence methodologies to perform an enhanced sampling of noisy biomedical data to improve the finding of meaningful solutions. Random sampling methods fail for high-dimensional biomedical problems. Sampling methods such as smart model parameterizations, forward surrogates, and parallel computing are better suited for such problems. We applied these methods to several important biomedical problems, such as phenotype prediction and a problem related to predicting the effects of protein mutations, i.e., if a given single residue mutation is neutral or deleterious, causing a disease. We also applied these methods to de novo drug discovery and drug repositioning (repurposing) through the enhanced exploration of huge chemical space. The purpose of these novel methods that address the problem of noise and uncertainty in biomedical data is to find new therapeutic solutions, perform drug repurposing, and accelerate and optimize drug discovery, thus reestablishing homeostasis. Finding the right target, the right compound, and the right patient are the three bottlenecks to running successful clinical trials from the correct analysis of preclinical models. Artificial intelligence can provide a solution to these problems, considering that the character of the data restricts the quality of the prediction, as in any modeling procedure in data analysis. The use of simple and plain methodologies is crucial to tackling these important and challenging problems, particularly drug repositioning/repurposing in rare diseases.", "Scoliosis is a 3D deformity of the spine in which one or more segments of the spine curve laterally, usually with rotation of the vertebral body. Generally, having a Cobb angle (Cobb) greater than 10\u00b0 can be considered scoliosis. In spine imaging, reliable and accurate identification and segmentation of bony features are crucial for scoliosis assessment, disease diagnosis, and treatment planning. Compared with commonly used X-ray detection methods, ultrasound has received extensive attention from researchers in the past years because of its lack of radiation, high real-time performance, and low price. On the basis of our previous research on spinal ultrasound imaging, this work combines artificial intelligence methods to create a new spine ultrasound image segmentation model called ultrasound global guidance block network (UGBNet), which provides a completely automatic and reliable spine segmentation and scoliosis visualization approach. Our network incorporates a global guidance block module that integrates spatial and channel attention, through which long-range feature dependencies and contextual scale information are learned. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model in semantic segmentation on spinal ultrasound datasets through extensive experiments with several classical learning segmentation methods, such as UNet. Results show that our method performs better than other approaches. Our UGBNet significantly improves segmentation precision, which can reach 74.2% on the evaluation metric of the Dice score.", "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread across the globe and has affected the health of millions of people. During the pandemic, social media was the major source of information for isolated and anxious people. Infodemics is defined as \"an overburden of information - some accurate and some not - that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy source and reliable guidance when they need it.\" Misinformation raised out of infodemics during COVID-19 created many serious issues regarding the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. With the help of available literature, we aimed to review the role of infodemic in relation to worsening of COVID-19 spread and vaccine utilization with possible preventable measures to control infodemic. Various social media platforms were a major source of infodemic. The active role of world agencies, narrative guidelines by the local authority, use of artificial intelligence (AI) by social media platforms and active participation of community and health care professionals can control infodemics effectively.", "Modern endoscopy relies on digital technology, from high-resolution imaging sensors and displays to electronics connecting configurable illumination and actuation systems for robotic articulation. In addition to enabling more effective diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the digitization of the procedural toolset enables video data capture of the internal human anatomy at unprecedented levels. Interventional video data encapsulate functional and structural information about a patient's anatomy as well as events, activity and action logs about the surgical process. This detailed but difficult-to-interpret record from endoscopic procedures can be linked to preoperative and postoperative records or patient imaging information. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence, especially in supervised deep learning, can utilize data from endoscopic procedures to develop systems for assisting procedures leading to computer-assisted interventions that can enable better navigation during procedures, automation of image interpretation and robotically assisted tool manipulation. In this Perspective, we summarize state-of-the-art artificial intelligence for computer-assisted interventions in gastroenterology and surgery.", "Although numerous scholars have studied resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, research exploring its relationship with emotional intelligence is scarce. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the resilience and emotional intelligence (EI) of staff nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data for this quantitative correlational study were gathered from the staff nurses of hospitals in the city of Hail, Saudi Arabia. The researchers employed simple random sampling, which yielded 261 staff nurses. Nationality (t = 6.422; p < 0.001) was found to have a significant relationship with resilience. Sex (t = 5.22; p < 0.001), ward assignment (t = 5.22; p < 0.001), age (F = 6.67; p < 0.001), and years of experience (F = 6.67; p < 0.001) revealed significant relationships with emotional intelligence. Resilience had a moderate positive relationship with EI (r = 0.55; p < 0.023), a weak positive relationship with self-emotion (r = 0.21; p < 0.003), and a very strong relationship with emotional appraisal (r = 0.85; p < 0.001). Improving emotional-intelligence skills is critical for assisting nurses during pandemic outbreaks. This can increase their individual and social resilience, while also improving their professional and life outcomes. These research findings suggest that emotional intelligence should be integrated into clinical practice and that EI data should be integrated into decision-making.", "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease of the brain that causes motor symptoms including slower movement, rigidity, tremor, and imbalance in addition to other problems like Alzheimer's disease (AD), psychiatric problems, insomnia, anxiety, and sensory abnormalities. Techniques including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have been established for the classification of PD and normal controls (NC) with similar therapeutic appearances in order to address these problems and improve the diagnostic procedure for PD. In this article, we examine a literature survey of research articles published up to September 2022 in order to present an in-depth analysis of the use of datasets, various modalities, experimental setups, and architectures that have been applied in the diagnosis of subjective disease. This analysis includes a total of 217 research publications with a list of the various datasets, methodologies, and features. These findings suggest that ML/DL methods and novel biomarkers hold promising results for application in medical decision-making, leading to a more methodical and thorough detection of PD. Finally, we highlight the challenges and provide appropriate recommendations on selecting approaches that might be used for subgrouping and connection analysis with structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), DaTSCAN, and single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) data for future Parkinson's research.", "Affective Computing is one of the central studies for achieving advanced human-computer interaction and is a popular research direction in the field of artificial intelligence for smart healthcare frameworks. In recent years, the use of electroencephalograms (EEGs) to analyze human emotional states has become a hot spot in the field of emotion recognition. However, the EEG is a non-stationary, non-linear signal that is sensitive to interference from other physiological signals and external factors. Traditional emotion recognition methods have limitations in complex algorithm structures and low recognition precision. In this article, based on an in-depth analysis of EEG signals, we have studied emotion recognition methods in the following respects. First, in this study, the DEAP dataset and the excitement model were used, and the original signal was filtered with others. The frequency band was selected using a butter filter and then the data was processed in the same range using min-max normalization. Besides, in this study, we performed hybrid experiments on sash windows and overlays to obtain an optimal combination for the calculation of features. We also apply the Discrete Wave Transform (DWT) to extract those functions from the preprocessed EEG data. Finally, a pre-trained k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) machine learning model was used in the recognition and classification process and different combinations of DWT and kNN parameters were tested and fitted. After 10-fold cross-validation, the precision reached 86.4%. Compared to state-of-the-art research, this method has higher recognition accuracy than conventional recognition methods, while maintaining a simple structure and high speed of operation.", "Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths, and gastrectomy with lymph node dissection is the mainstay of treatment. Despite clinician efforts and advances in surgical methods, the incidence of complications after gastrectomy remains 10%-20% including fatalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on utilization of a deep learning method to build a new artificial intelligence model that could help surgeons diagnose these complications.\nA neural network was constructed with a total of 4000 variables. Clinical, surgical, and pathological data of patients who underwent radical gastrectomy at our institute were collected to maintain a deep learning model. We optimized the parameters of the neural network to diagnose whether these patients would develop complications after gastrectomy or not.\nSeventy percent of the data was used to optimize the neural network parameters, and the rest was used to validate the model. A model that maximized the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for validation of the data was extracted. The ROC-AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the model to diagnose all complications were 0.8 vs 0.7, 81% vs 50%, and 69% vs 75%, for the teaching and validation data, respectively.\nA predictive model for postoperative complications after radical gastrectomy was successfully constructed using the deep learning method. This model can help surgeons accurately predict the incidence of complications on postoperative day 3.", "\"Morphological computation\" is an increasingly important concept in robotics, artificial intelligence, and philosophy of the mind. It is used to understand how the body contributes to cognition and control of behavior. Its understanding in terms of \"offloading\" computation from the brain to the body has been criticized as misleading, and it has been suggested that the use of the concept conflates three classes of distinct processes. In fact, these criticisms implicitly hang on accepting a semantic definition of what constitutes computation. Here, I argue that an alternative, mechanistic view on computation offers a significantly different understanding of what morphological computation is. These theoretical considerations are then used to analyze the existing research program in developmental biology, which understands morphogenesis, the process of development of shape in biological systems, as a computational process. This important line of research shows that cognition and intelligence can be found across all scales of life, as the proponents of the basal cognition research program propose. Hence, clarifying the connection between morphological computation and morphogenesis allows for strengthening the role of the former concept in this emerging research field.", "As the Covid-19 pandemic brought most in-person activities to a halt, radical and visible changes were imposed in all social interactions, including teaching and academic activity in general. This challenging setting tested the education system's capacity to successfully address the Sustainable Development Goals. The success of education for sustainable development (ESD) requires training in the specific skills needed to face the highly emotionally demanding post-pandemic context. In this line, this study focuses on university students' capability to understand and manage emotions, an issue considered to be a key factor in ESD. The aim of this study is to show how students' emotional intelligence influenced their resilience, with repercussions on their engagement and subsequent academic performance. The research model was tested through a questionnaire addressed to 340 students from three different universities during the full lockdown of March-May 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Results show that emotional intelligence was positively related to resilience, which in turn was related to engagement, and consequently, resulted in better academic performance. This finding should spark interest in developing emotional intelligence in education, not only because it produces healthy citizens in the long term, but also because of its short-term positive impacts in the classroom, particularly in such adverse situations as those described here. This study provides a model that links classic variables on educational and positive psychology research with ESD in times of COVID-19.", "The revolution of artificial intelligence and its impacts on our daily life has led to tremendous interest in the field and its related subtypes: machine learning and deep learning. Scientists and developers have designed machine learning- and deep learning-based algorithms to perform various tasks related to tumor pathologies, such as tumor detection, classification, grading with variant stages, diagnostic forecasting, recognition of pathological attributes, pathogenesis, and genomic mutations. Pathologists are interested in artificial intelligence to improve the diagnosis precision impartiality and to minimize the workload combined with the time consumed, which affects the accuracy of the decision taken. Regrettably, there are already certain obstacles to overcome connected to artificial intelligence deployments, such as the applicability and validation of algorithms and computational technologies, in addition to the ability to train pathologists and doctors to use these machines and their willingness to accept the results. This review paper provides a survey of how machine learning and deep learning methods could be implemented into health care providers' routine tasks and the obstacles and opportunities for artificial intelligence application in tumor morphology.", "With the rapid development of edge intelligence (EI) and machine learning (ML), the applications of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have been discovered in all aspects of the life world. As one of its most essential branches, Medical CPS (MCPS) determines human health and medical treatment in the Internet of Everything (IOE) era. Knowledge sharing is the critical point of MCPS and has also been humanity's best dream through the ages. This paper explores a novel knowledge-sharing model in MCPS and takes a pulmonary nodule detection task as a significant case for building an Unet-based mask generator. A Classification-guided Module (CGM)-based discriminator with knowledge from EMRs is set against a generator to offer a promising result for each mask from the inexperienced participant of federated ML. After an iterative communication between the federated server and its clients for knowledge sharing, the segmented sub-image owns a coincident attribute distribution with that of the EMRs from the experts. Besides, the adversarial network augment the data to normalize the data distribution for all the clients as a remission for none independent identically distributed (non-IID) data problem. We implement a detection framework on the simulated EI environment following an existing adaptive synchronization strategy based on data sharing and median loss function. On 1304 scans of the merged dataset, our proposed framework can help boost the detection performance for most of the existing methods of pulmonary nodule detection.", "Burnout syndrome has recently been recognized as a public health problem, widely observed in educational settings. In this study, we aimed to examine the role played by contextual variables, including job (in)stability and teachers' personal characteristics, in predicting factors associated with teacher burnout, using a convenience sample of 137 Italian primary school teachers (94.2% female, Age: M = 47.17, SD = 8.88). The findings from the hierarchical regression analyses showed that both trait emotional intelligence (EI) and trait anxiety predicted emotional exhaustion and lack of personal accomplishment in relation to work, with EI having a negative association and anxiety having a positive association with both. As for contextual variables, job instability positively predicted low personal accomplishment, whereas teachers' working experience predicted emotional exhaustion. We discuss these results in light of the current working environment experienced by Italian teachers, which includes a high percentage of fixed-term workers. Moreover, we examine the implications for research and interventions related to trait EI as a protective factor that might prevent the onset of chronic professional burnout among teachers and increase teachers' effectiveness and, therefore, pupils' well-being, resulting in positive educational outcomes.", "Detached off-grids, subject to the generated renewable energy (RE), need to balance and compensate the unstable power supply dependent on local source potential. Power quality (PQ) is a set of EU standards that state acceptable deviations in the parameters of electrical power systems to guarantee their operability without dropout. Optimization of the estimated PQ parameters in a day-horizon is essential in the operational planning of autonomous smart grids, which accommodate the norms for the specific equipment and user demands to avoid malfunctions. PQ data for all system states are not available for dozens of connected / switched on household appliances, defined by their binary load series only, as the number of combinations grows exponentially. The load characteristics and eventual RE contingent supply can result in system instability and unacceptable PQ events. Models, evolved by Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods using self-optimization algorithms, can estimate unknown cases and states in autonomous systems contingent on self-supply of RE power related to chaotic and intermitted local weather sources. A new multilevel extension procedure designed to incrementally improve the applicability and adaptability to training data. The initial AI model starts with binary load series only, which are insufficient to represent complex data patterns. The input vector is progressively extended with correlated PQ parameters at the next estimation level to better represent the active demand of the power consumer. Historical data sets comprise training samples for all PQ parameters, but only the load sequences of the switch-on appliances are available in the next estimation states. The most valuable PQ parameters are selected and estimated in the previous algorithm stages to be used as supplementary series in the next more precise computing. More complex models, using the previous PQ-data approximates, are formed at the secondary processing levels to estimate the target PQ-output in better quality. The new added input parameters allow us to evolve a more convenient model form. The proposed multilevel refinement algorithm can be generally applied in modelling of unknown sequence states of dynamical systems, initially described by binary series or other insufficient limited-data variables, which are inadequate in a problem representation. Most AI computing techniques can adapt this strategy to improve their adaptive learning and model performance.", "This article will explore the expressivity and tractability of vividness, as viewed from the interdisciplinary perspective of the cognitive sciences, including the sub-disciplines of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and phenomenology. Following the precursor work by Benussi in experimental phenomenology, seminal papers by David Marks in psychology and, later, Hector Levesque in computer science, a substantial part of the discussion has been around a symbolic approach to the concept of vividness. At the same time, a similar concept linked to semantic memory, imagery, and mental models has had a long history in cognitive psychology, with new emerging links to cognitive neuroscience. More recently, there is a push towards neural-symbolic representations which allows room for the integration of brain models of vividness to a symbolic concept of vividness. Such works lead to question the phenomenology of vividness in the context of consciousness, and the related ethical concerns. The purpose of this paper is to review the state of the art, advances, and further potential developments of artificial-human vividness while laying the ground for a shared conceptual platform for dialogue, communication, and debate across all the relevant sub-disciplines. Within such context, an important goal of the paper is to define the crucial role of vividness in grounding simulation and modeling within the psychology (and neuroscience) of human reasoning.", "Microelectromechanical-system (MEMS)-based semiconductor gas sensors are considered one of the fastest-growing, interdisciplinary high technologies during the post-Moore era. Modern advancements within this arena include wearable electronics, Internet of Things, and artificial brain-inspired intelligence, among other modalities, thus bringing opportunities to drive MEMS-based gas sensors with higher performance, lower costs, and wider applicability. However, the high demand for miniature and micropower sensors with unified processes on a single chip imposes great challenges. This review focuses on recent developments and pitfalls in MEMS-based micro- and nanoscale gas sensors and details future trends. We also cover the background of the topic, seminal efforts, current applications and challenges, and opportunities for next-generation systems.", "Industries and services are undergoing an Internet of Things centric transformation globally, giving rise to an explosion of multi-modal data generated each second. This, with the requirement of low-latency result delivery, has led to the ubiquitous adoption of edge and cloud computing paradigms. Edge computing follows the data gravity principle, wherein the computational devices move closer to the end-users to minimize data transfer and communication times. However, large-scale computation has exacerbated the problem of efficient resource management in hybrid edge-cloud platforms. In this regard, data-driven models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained popularity to give rise to the notion of edge intelligence. However, DNNs face significant problems of data saturation when fed volatile data. Data saturation is when providing more data does not translate to improvements in performance. To address this issue, prior work has leveraged coupled simulators that, akin to digital twins, generate out-of-distribution training data alleviating the data-saturation problem. However, simulators face the reality-gap problem, which is the inaccuracy in the emulation of real computational infrastructure due to the abstractions in such simulators. To combat this, we develop a framework, SimTune, that tackles this challenge by leveraging a low-fidelity surrogate model of the high-fidelity simulator to update the parameters of the latter, so to increase the simulation accuracy. This further helps co-simulated methods to generalize to edge-cloud configurations for which human encoded parameters are not known apriori. Experiments comparing SimTune against state-of-the-art data-driven resource management solutions on a real edge-cloud platform demonstrate that simulator tuning can improve quality of service metrics such as energy consumption and response time by up to 14.7% and 7.6% respectively.", "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease using 18F-FDG PET images are obtaining promising results; however, one of the main challenges in this domain is the fact that these models work as black-box systems. We developed a CNN that performs a multiclass classification task of volumetric 18F-FDG PET images, and we experimented two different post hoc explanation techniques developed in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Saliency Map (SM) and Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Finally, we quantitatively analyze the explanations returned and inspect their relationship with the PET signal. We collected 2552 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative labeled as Cognitively Normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and we developed and tested a 3D CNN that classifies the 3D PET scans into its final clinical diagnosis. The model developed achieves, to the best of our knowledge, performances comparable with the relevant literature on the test set, with an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) for prediction of CN, MCI, and AD 0.81, 0.63, and 0.77 respectively. We registered the heatmaps with the Talairach Atlas to perform a regional quantitative analysis of the relationship between heatmaps and PET signals. With the quantitative analysis of the post hoc explanation techniques, we observed that LRP maps were more effective in mapping the importance metrics in the anatomic atlas. No clear relationship was found between the heatmap and the PET signal.", "The discovery and repurposing of drugs require a deep understanding of the mechanism of drug action (MODA). Existing computational methods mainly model MODA with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. However, the molecular interactions of drugs in the human body are far beyond PPIs. Additionally, the lack of interpretability of these models hinders their practicability. We propose an interpretable deep learning-based path-reasoning framework (iDPath) for drug discovery and repurposing by capturing MODA on by far the most comprehensive multilayer biological network consisting of the complex high-dimensional molecular interactions between genes, proteins and chemicals. Experiments show that iDPath outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning methods on a general drug repurposing task. Further investigations demonstrate that iDPath can identify explicit critical paths that are consistent with clinical evidence. To demonstrate the practical value of iDPath, we apply it to the identification of potential drugs for treating prostate cancer and hypertension. Results show that iDPath can discover new FDA-approved drugs. This research provides a novel interpretable artificial intelligence perspective on drug discovery.", "More than 250,000 patients die from Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma each year. Currently, molecular imaging with 18F-FDG-PET/CT is the standard of care for lymphoma staging and therapy response assessment. In this review, we will briefly summarize the role of molecular imaging for lymphoma diagnosis, staging, outcome prediction, and prognostication. We discuss future directions in response assessment and surveillance with quantitative PET parameters, the utility of interim assessment, and the differences with response assessment to immunomodulatory therapy. Lastly, we will cover innovations in the field regarding novel tracers and artificial intelligence.", "To compare general ophthalmologists, retina specialists, and the EyeArt Artificial Intelligence (AI) system to the clinical reference standard for detecting more than mild diabetic retinopathy (mtmDR).\nProspective, pivotal, multicenter trial conducted from April 2017 to May\u00a02018.\nParticipants were aged \u2265 18 years who had diabetes mellitus and underwent dilated ophthalmoscopy. A total of 521 of 893 participants met these criteria and completed the study protocol.\nParticipants underwent 2-field fundus photography (macula centered, disc centered) for the EyeArt system, dilated ophthalmoscopy, and 4-widefield stereoscopic dilated fundus photography for reference standard grading.\nFor mtmDR detection, sensitivity and specificity of EyeArt gradings of 2-field, fundus photographs and ophthalmoscopy grading versus a rigorous clinical reference standard comprising Reading Center grading of 4-widefield stereoscopic dilated fundus photographs using the ETDRS severity scale. The AI system provided automatic eye-level results regarding mtmDR.\nOverall, 521 participants (999 eyes) at 10 centers underwent dilated ophthalmoscopy: 406 by nonretina and 115 by retina specialists. Reading Center graded 207 positive and 792 eyes negative for mtmDR. Of these 999 eyes, 26 eyes were ungradable by the EyeArt system, leaving 973 eyes with both EyeArt and Reading Center gradings. Retina specialists correctly identified 22 of 37 eyes as positive (sensitivity 59.5%) and 182 of 184 eyes as negative (specificity 98.9%) for mtmDR versus the EyeArt AI system that identified 36 of 37 as positive (sensitivity 97%) and 162 of 184 eyes as negative (specificity of 88%) for mtmDR. General ophthalmologists correctly identified 35 of 170 eyes as positive (sensitivity 20.6%) and 607 of 608 eyes as negative (specificity 99.8%) for mtmDR compared with the EyeArt AI system that identified 164 of 170 as positive (sensitivity 96.5%) and 525 of 608 eyes as negative (specificity 86%) for mtmDR.\nThe AI system had a higher sensitivity for detecting mtmDR than either general ophthalmologists or retina specialists compared with the clinical reference standard. It can potentially serve as a low-cost point-of-care diabetic retinopathy detection tool and help address the diabetic eye screening burden.", "Education, intelligence, and cognition are associated with hypertension, but which one plays the most prominent role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and which modifiable risk factors mediate the causal effects remains unknown.\nUsing summary statistics of genome-wide association studies of predominantly European ancestry, we conducted 2-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the independent effects of education, intelligence, or cognition on hypertension (FinnGen study, 70 651 cases/223 663 controls; UK Biobank, 77 723 cases/330 366 controls) and blood pressure (International Consortium of Blood Pressure, 757 601 participants), and used 2-step Mendelian randomization to evaluate 25 potential mediators of the association and calculate the mediated proportions.\nMeta-analysis of inverse variance weighted Mendelian randomization results from FinnGen and UK Biobank showed that genetically predicted 1-SD (4.2 years) higher education was associated with 44% (95% CI: 0.40-0.79) decreased hypertension risk and 1.682 mm Hg lower systolic and 0.898 mm Hg lower diastolic blood pressure, independently of intelligence and cognition. While the causal effects of intelligence and cognition on hypertension were not independent of education; 6 out of 25 cardiometabolic risk factors were identified as mediators of the association between education and hypertension, ranked by mediated proportions, including body mass index (mediated proportion: 30.1%), waist-to-hip ratio (22.8%), body fat percentage (14.1%), major depression (7.0%), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (4.7%), and triglycerides (3.4%). These results were robust to sensitivity analyses.\nOur findings illustrated the causal, independent impact of education on hypertension and blood pressure and outlined cardiometabolic mediators as priority targets for prevention of hypertension attributable to low education.", "As data are increasingly being stored in different silos and societies becoming more aware of data privacy issues, the traditional centralized training of artificial intelligence (AI) models is facing efficiency and privacy challenges. Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an alternative solution and continues to thrive in this new reality. Existing FL protocol designs have been shown to be vulnerable to adversaries within or outside of the system, compromising data privacy and system robustness. Besides training powerful global models, it is of paramount importance to design FL systems that have privacy guarantees and are resistant to different types of adversaries. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey on privacy and robustness in FL over the past five years. Through a concise introduction to the concept of FL and a unique taxonomy covering: 1) threat models; 2) privacy attacks and defenses; and 3) poisoning attacks and defenses, we provide an accessible review of this important topic. We highlight the intuitions, key techniques, and fundamental assumptions adopted by various attacks and defenses. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions toward robust and privacy-preserving FL, and their interplays with the multidisciplinary goals of FL.", "The differential gene expression under phosphate stress conditions leads to cross-talk between the global regulator, pho regulon, and metabolic genes. Promoter activity analysis of the selected 23 genes reveals the dynamic nature of real-time gene expression under different phosphate conditions. The expression profiles of the global regulator (rpoD, soxR, soxS, arcB, and fur), pho regulon (phoH, phoR, phoB, and ugpB), and metabolic genes (sdh, pfkA, ldh) varied significantly on phosphate level variation. Under stress conditions, soxR switches expression partners and co-expresses with rpoS instead of soxS. The partner-switching behavior of the genes under a challenging environment represents the intelligence of functional execution and ensures cell survival. The dynamic expression profile of the selected genes applies a time-lagged correlation to provide insight into the differential gene interaction between time-shifted expression profiles. Under different phosphate conditions, the minimum spanning tree graph revealed a different clustering pattern of selected genes depending on the computed distance and its proximity to other promoters.", "Screening for left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), defined as reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), deserves renewed interest as the medical treatment for the prevention and progression of heart failure improves. We aimed to review the updated literature to outline the potential and caveats of using artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiography (AIeECG) as an opportunistic screening tool for LVSD.We searched PubMed and Cochrane for variations of the terms \"ECG,\" \"Heart Failure,\" \"systolic dysfunction,\" and \"Artificial Intelligence\" from January 2010 to April 2022 and selected studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy and confounders of using AIeECG to detect LVSD.Out of 40 articles, we identified 15 relevant studies; eleven retrospective cohorts, three prospective cohorts, and one case series. Although various LVEF thresholds were used, AIeECG detected LVSD with a median AUC of 0.90 (IQR from 0.85 to 0.95), a sensitivity of 83.3% (IQR from 73 to 86.9%) and a specificity of 87% (IQR from 84.5 to 90.9%). AIeECG algorithms succeeded across a wide range of sex, age, and comorbidity and seemed especially useful in non-cardiology settings and when combined with natriuretic peptide testing. Furthermore, a false-positive AIeECG indicated a future development of LVSD. No studies investigated the effect on treatment or patient outcomes.This systematic review corroborates the arrival of a new generic biomarker, AIeECG, to improve the detection of LVSD. AIeECG, in addition to natriuretic peptides and echocardiograms, will improve screening for LVSD, but prospective randomized implementation trials with added therapy are needed to show cost-effectiveness and clinical significance.", "As the information age wanes, enabling the prevalence of the artificial intelligence age; expectations, responsibilities, and job definitions need to be redefined for those who provide services in healthcare. This study examined the perceptions of future physicians on the possible influences of artificial intelligence on medicine, and to determine the needs that might be helpful for curriculum restructuring.\nA cross-sectional multi-centre study was conducted among medical students country-wide, where 3018 medical students participated. The instrument of the study was an online survey that was designed and distributed via a web-based service.\nMost of the medical students perceived artificial intelligence as an assistive technology that could facilitate physicians' access to information (85.8%) and patients to healthcare (76.7%), and reduce errors (70.5%). However, half of the participants were worried about the possible reduction in the services of physicians, which could lead to unemployment (44.9%). Furthermore, it was agreed that using artificial intelligence in medicine could devalue the medical profession (58.6%), damage trust (45.5%), and negatively affect patient-physician relationships (42.7%). Moreover, nearly half of the participants affirmed that they could protect their professional confidentiality when using artificial intelligence applications (44.7%); whereas, 16.1% argued that artificial intelligence in medicine might cause violations of professional confidentiality. Of all the participants, only 6.0% stated that they were competent enough to inform patients about the features and risks of artificial intelligence. They further expressed that their educational gaps regarding their need for \"knowledge and skills related to artificial intelligence applications\" (96.2%), \"applications for reducing medical errors\" (95.8%), and \"training to prevent and solve ethical problems that might arise as a result of using artificial intelligence applications\" (93.8%).\nThe participants expressed a need for an update on the medical curriculum, according to necessities in transforming healthcare driven by artificial intelligence. The update should revolve around equipping future physicians with the knowledge and skills to effectively use artificial intelligence applications and ensure that professional values and rights are protected.", "Understanding of the complement principle has been proposed as closely related to computational skills, but few studies have investigated their interrelations. The present longitudinal study attempted to clarify the picture by examining their potential cross-lagged relation. Fourth graders (n = 221) in Hong Kong received 3 cognitive assessments at intervals of 6 months, consisting of multiple measures of complement understanding, a nonverbal intelligence test, and a computational skills measure. A random intercept cross-lagged panel model revealed that complement understanding significantly predicted future computational skills, but the reciprocal prediction was nonsignificant. The findings provide empirical evidence supporting the close relation between complement understanding and computational skills and call for future endeavors to examine the interrelations between computational skills and understanding of other arithmetic principles.

Most of the products had been cleared through the 510(k) pathway, and all clearances were based on previously collected retrospective data; 6 products used multicenter designs; 7 products used enriched data; and 4 lacked details on whether products were externally validated. Test performance measures, including sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve, were the main outcomes reported. Most of the devices used tissue biopsy as the criterion standard for BCS accuracy evaluation. Other clinical outcome measures, including cancer stage at diagnosis and interval cancer detection, were not reported for any of the devices.\nThe findings of this review suggest important gaps in reporting of data sources, data set type, validation approach, and clinical utility assessment. As AI-assisted reading becomes more widespread in BCS and other radiologic examinations, strengthened FDA evidentiary regulatory standards, development of postmarketing surveillance, a focus on clinically meaningful outcomes, and stakeholder engagement will be critical for ensuring the safety and efficacy of these products.", "This study examined the protective role of self-esteem and perceived emotional intelligence on mental health problems in Spanish adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic.\nParticipants (N = 139; Mage = 13.83 years, SD = 0.96; 63.8% female) completed measures before the outbreak of COVID-19 (T1) and during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain (T2).\nParticipants self-reported emotional intelligence, self-esteem, mental health problems and suicidal behavior.\nAdolescent mental health problems were equally affected by COVID-19 pandemic according to gender, age and lockdown conditions. Adolescents with low levels of emotional intelligence and self-esteem at T1 showed a significant decrease in self-reported anxiety, depression, stress and suicidal behavior at T2. However, adolescents with average or high levels of emotional intelligence and self-esteem at T1 showed no significant changes in mental health problems at T2. Self-esteem at T1 meditated the relationships between emotional intelligence at T1 (clarity and repair) and emotional symptoms at T2 (depression, anxiety and stress). Furthermore, the relationship between self-esteem and anxiety symptoms was moderated by the number of people living together during COVID-19 lockdown.\nOur findings highlight the protective role of pre-pandemic development of self-esteem and emotional intelligence in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on adolescent mental health during the pandemic.\nCette \u00e9tude a examin\u00e9 le r\u00f4le protecteur de l'estime de soi et de l'intelligence \u00e9motionnelle per\u00e7ue sur les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale chez les adolescents espagnols pendant la pand\u00e9mie de COVID-19.Conception: Les participants (N= 139; AM= 13,83 ans, ET= 0,96; 63,8% de femmes) ont rempli des formulaires avant l'apparition du COVID-19 (T1) et pendant la premi\u00e8re vague de la pand\u00e9mie en Espagne (T2).Principales mesures des r\u00e9sultats: Les participants ont auto-\u00e9valu\u00e9 l'intelligence \u00e9motionnelle, l'estime de soi, les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale et le comportement suicidaire.R\u00e9sultats: Les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale des adolescents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e9gale par la pand\u00e9mie de COVID-19 selon le sexe, l'\u00e2ge et les conditions de confinement.

This essential physicochemical characteristic is quantitatively expressed by the equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) whose experimental determination is tedious since it requires knowledge of the phase behavior of the SOW systems at different temperatures and for different surfactant concentrations. In this work, two mathematical models are proposed for the rapid prediction of the EACN of oils. They have been designed using artificial intelligence (machine-learning) methods, namely, neural networks (NN) and graph machines (GM). While the GM model is implemented from the SMILES codes of a 111-molecule training set of known EACN values, the NN model is fed with some \u03c3-moment descriptors computed with the COSMOtherm software for the 111-molecule set. In a preliminary step, the leave-one-out algorithm is used to select, given the available data, the appropriate complexity of the two models. A comparison of the EACNs of liquids of a fresh set of 10 complex cosmetic and perfumery molecules shows that the two approaches provide comparable results in terms of accuracy and reliability. Finally, the NN and GM models are applied to nine series of homologous compounds, for which the GM model results are in better agreement with the experimental EACN trends than the NN model predictions. The results obtained by the GMs and by the NN based on \u03c3-moments can be duplicated with the demonstration tool available for download as detailed in the Supporting Information.", "Multiple reporting guidelines for artificial intelligence (AI) models in healthcare recommend that models be audited for reliability and fairness. However, there is a gap of operational guidance for performing reliability and fairness audits in practice. Following guideline recommendations, we conducted a reliability audit of two models based on model performance and calibration as well as a fairness audit based on summary statistics, subgroup performance and subgroup calibration. We assessed the Epic End-of-Life (EOL) Index model and an internally developed Stanford Hospital Medicine (HM) Advance Care Planning (ACP) model in 3 practice settings: Primary Care, Inpatient Oncology and Hospital Medicine, using clinicians' answers to the surprise question (\"Would you be surprised if [patient X] passed away in [Y years]?\") as a surrogate outcome. For performance, the models had positive predictive value (PPV) at or above 0.76 in all settings. In Hospital Medicine and Inpatient Oncology, the Stanford HM ACP model had higher sensitivity (0.69, 0.89 respectively) than the EOL model (0.20, 0.27), and better calibration (O/E 1.5, 1.7) than the EOL model (O/E 2.5, 3.0). The Epic EOL model flagged fewer patients (11%, 21% respectively) than the Stanford HM ACP model (38%, 75%). There were no differences in performance and calibration by sex. Both models had lower sensitivity in Hispanic/Latino male patients with Race listed as \"Other.\" 10 clinicians were surveyed after a presentation summarizing the audit. 10/10 reported that summary statistics, overall performance, and subgroup performance would affect their decision to use the model to guide care; 9/10 said the same for overall and subgroup calibration. The most commonly identified barriers for routinely conducting such reliability and fairness audits were poor demographic data quality and lack of data access. This audit required 115 person-hours across 8-10 months. Our recommendations for performing reliability and fairness audits include verifying data validity, analyzing model performance on intersectional subgroups, and collecting clinician-patient linkages as necessary for label generation by clinicians. Those responsible for AI models should require such audits before model deployment and mediate between model auditors and impacted stakeholders.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is limited to teeth and periodontal disease in the dental field, and is used for diagnosis assistance or data analysis, and there has been no research conducted in actual clinical situations. So, we created an environment similar to actual clinical practice and conducted research by selecting three of the soft tissue diseases (carotid artery calcification, lymph node calcification, and sialolith) that are difficult for general dentists to see. Therefore, in this study, the accuracy and reading time are evaluated using panoramic images and AI. A total of 20,000 panoramic images including three diseases were used to develop and train a fast R-CNN model. To compare the performance of the developed model, two oral and maxillofacial radiologists (OMRs) and two general dentists (GDs) read 352 images, excluding the panoramic images used in development for soft tissue calcification diagnosis. On the first visit, the observers read images without AI; on the second visit, the same observers used AI to read the same image. The diagnostic accuracy and specificity for soft tissue calcification of AI were high from 0.727 to 0.926 and from 0.171 to 1.000, whereas the sensitivity for lymph node calcification and sialolith were low at 0.250 and 0.188, respectively. The reading time of AI increased in the GD group (619 to 1049) and decreased in the OMR group (1347 to 1372). In addition, reading scores increased in both groups (GD from 11.4 to 39.8 and OMR from 3.4 to 10.8). Using AI, although the detection sensitivity of sialolith and lymph node calcification was lower than that of carotid artery calcification, the total reading time of the OMR specialists was reduced and the GDs reading accuracy was improved. The AI used in this study helped to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the GD group, who were not familiar with the soft tissue calcification diagnosis, but more data sets are needed to improve the detection performance of the two diseases with low sensitivity of AI.", "Perineural invasion (PNI), a form of local invasion defined as the ability of cancer cells to invade in, around, and through nerves, has a negative prognostic impact in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). Unfortunately, the diagnosis of PNI suffers from a significant degree of intra- and interobserver variability. The aim of this pilot study was to develop a deep learning-based human-enhanced tool, termed domain knowledge enhanced yield (Domain-KEY) algorithm, for identifying PNI in digital slides.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs, n = 85) were obtained from 80 patients with OCSCC. The model structure consisted of two parts to simulate human decision-making skills in diagnostic pathology. To this aim, two semantic segmentation models were constructed (i.e., identification of nerve fibers followed by the diagnosis of PNI). The inferred results were subsequently subjected to post-processing of generated decision rules for diagnostic labeling. Ten H&E-stained WSIs not previously used in the study were read and labeled by the Domain-KEY algorithm. Thereafter, labeling correctness was visually inspected by two independent pathologists.\nThe Domain-KEY algorithm was found to outperform the ResnetV2_50 classifier for the detection of PNI (diagnostic accuracy: 89.01% and 61.94%, respectively). On analyzing WSIs, the algorithm achieved a mean diagnostic accuracy as high as 97.50% versus traditional pathology. The observed accuracy in a validation dataset of 25 WSIs obtained from seven patients with oropharyngeal (cancer of the tongue base, n = 1; tonsil cancer, n = 1; soft palate cancer, n = 1) and hypopharyngeal (cancer of posterior wall, n = 2; pyriform sinus cancer, n = 2) malignancies was 96%. Notably, the algorithm was successfully applied in the analysis of WSIs to shorten the time required to reach a diagnosis. The addition of the hybrid intelligence model decreased the mean time required to reach a diagnosis by 15.0% and 23.7% for the first and second pathologists, respectively. On analyzing digital slides, the tool was effective in supporting human diagnostic thinking.\nThe Domain-KEY algorithm successfully mimicked human decision-making skills and supported expert pathologists in the routine diagnosis of PNI.", "The aim of this study was to develop artificial intelligence (AI) guided framework to recognize tooth numbers in panoramic and intraoral radiographs (periapical and bitewing) without prior domain knowledge and arrange the intraoral radiographs into a full mouth series (FMS) arrangement template. This model can be integrated with different diseases diagnosis models, such as periodontitis or caries, to facilitate clinical examinations and diagnoses.\nThe framework utilized image segmentation models to generate the masks of bone area, tooth, and cementoenamel junction (CEJ) lines from intraoral radiographs. These masks were used to detect and extract teeth bounding boxes utilizing several image analysis methods. Then, individual teeth were matched with a patient's panoramic images (if available) or tooth repositories for assigning tooth numbers using the multi-scale matching strategy. This framework was tested on 1240 intraoral radiographs different from the training and internal validation cohort to avoid data snooping. Besides, a web interface was designed to generate a report for different dental abnormalities with tooth numbers to evaluate this framework's practicality in clinical settings.\nThe proposed method achieved the following precision and recall via panoramic view: 0.96 and 0.96 (via panoramic view) and 0.87 and 0.87 (via repository match) by handling tooth shape variation and outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the proposed framework could accurately arrange a set of intraoral radiographs into an FMS arrangement template based on positions and tooth numbers with an accuracy of 95% for periapical images and 90% for bitewing images. The accuracy of this framework was also 94% in the images with missing teeth and 89% with restorations.\nThe proposed tooth numbering model is robust and self-contained and can also be integrated with other dental diagnosis modules, such as alveolar bone assessment and caries detection. This artificial intelligence-based tooth detection and tooth number assignment in dental radiographs will help dentists with enhanced communication, documentation, and treatment planning accurately. In addition, the proposed framework can correctly specify detailed diagnostic information associated with a single tooth without human intervention.", "The predictive role of chest radiographs in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) is underestimated and may benefit from artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\nTo train, test, and validate a deep learning (DL) solution for detecting significant CAD based on chest radiographs.\nData of patients referred for angina and undergoing chest radiography and coronary angiography were analysed retrospectively. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was designed to detect significant CAD from posteroanterior/anteroposterior chest radiographs. The DCNN was trained for severe CAD binary classification (absence/presence). Coronary angiography reports were the ground truth. Stenosis severity of \u226570% for non-left main vessels and\u00a0\u2265\u00a050% for left main defined severe CAD.\nInformation of 7728 patients was reviewed. Severe CAD was present in 4091 (53%). Patients were randomly divided for algorithm training (70%; n\u00a0=\u00a05454) and fine-tuning/model validation (10%; n\u00a0=\u00a0773). Internal clinical validation (model testing) was performed with the remaining patients (20%; n\u00a0=\u00a01501). At binary logistic regression, DCNN prediction was the strongest severe CAD predictor (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; OR: 1.040; CI: 1.032-1.048). Using a high sensitivity operating cut-point, the DCNN had a sensitivity of 0.90 to detect significant CAD (specificity 0.31; AUC 0.73; 95% CI DeLong, 0.69-0.76). Adding to the AI chest radiograph interpretation angina status improved the prediction (AUC 0.77; 95% CI DeLong, 0.74-0.80).\nAI-read chest radiographs could be used to pre-test significant CAD probability in patients referred for suspected angina. Further studies are required to externally validate our algorithm, develop a clinically applicable tool, and support CAD screening in broader settings.", "Biological neural networks adapt and learn in diverse behavioral contexts. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have exploited biological properties to solve complex problems. However, despite their effectiveness for specific tasks, ANNs are yet to realize the flexibility and adaptability of biological cognition. This review highlights recent advances in computational and experimental research to advance our understanding of biological and artificial intelligence. In particular, we discuss critical mechanisms from the cellular, systems, and cognitive neuroscience fields that have contributed to refining the architecture and training algorithms of ANNs. Additionally, we discuss how recent work used ANNs to understand complex neuronal correlates of cognition and to process high throughput behavioral data.", "Investors, entrepreneurs, health care pundits, and venture capital firms all agree that the health care sector is awaiting a digital revolution. Steven Case, in 2016, predicted a \"third wave\" of innovation that would leverage big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to transform medicine and finally achieve reduced costs, improved efficiency, and better patient outcomes. Academic medical centers (AMCs) have the infrastructure and resources needed by digital health intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs to innovate, iterate, and optimize technology solutions for the major pain points of modern medicine. With large unique patient data sets, strong research programs, and subject matter experts, AMCs have the ability to assess, optimize, and integrate new digital health tools with feedback at the point of care and research-based clinical validation. As AMCs begin to explore digital health solutions, they must decide between forming internal teams to develop these innovations or collaborating with external companies. Although each has its drawbacks and benefits, AMCs can both benefit from and drive forward the digital health innovations that will result from this journey. This viewpoint will provide an explanation as to why AMCs are ideal incubators for digital health solutions and describe what these organizations will need to be successful in leading this \"third wave\" of innovation.", "Unusual walk patterns may increase individuals' risks of falling. Anthropometric features of the human body, such as the body mass index (BMI), influences the walk patterns of individuals. In addition to the BMI, uneven walking surfaces may cause variations in the usual walk patterns of an individual that will potentially increase the individual's risk of falling. The objective of this study was to statistically evaluate the variations in the walk patterns of individuals belonging to two BMI groups across a wide range of walking surfaces and to investigate whether a deep learning method could classify the BMI-specific walk patterns with similar variations. Data collected by wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors attached to individuals with two different BMI were collected while walking on real-world surfaces. In addition to traditional statistical analysis tools, an advanced deep learning-based neural network was used to evaluate and classify the BMI-specific walk patterns. The walk patterns of overweight/obese individuals showed a greater correlation with the corresponding walking surfaces than the normal-weight population. The results were supported by the deep learning method, which was able to classify the walk patterns of overweight/obese (94.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5%) individuals more accurately than those of normal-weight (59.4\u2009\u00b1\u200923.7%) individuals. The results suggest that application of the deep learning method is more suitable for recognizing the walk patterns of overweight/obese population than those of normal-weight individuals. The findings from the study will potentially inform healthcare applications, including artificial intelligence-based fall assessment systems for minimizing the risk of fall-related incidents among overweight and obese individuals.", "Associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and brain morphology have been reported, although with several inconsistencies. These may partly stem from confounding bias, which could distort associations and limit generalizability. We examined how associations between brain morphology and ADHD symptoms change with adjustments for potential confounders typically overlooked in the literature (aim 1), and for the intelligence quotient (IQ) and head motion, which are generally corrected for but play ambiguous roles (aim 2).\nParticipants were 10-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (N = 7722) and Generation R (N = 2531) Studies. Cortical area, volume, and thickness were measured with MRI and ADHD symptoms with the Child Behavior Checklist. Surface-based cross-sectional analyses were run.\nADHD symptoms related to widespread cortical regions when solely adjusting for demographic factors. Additional adjustments for socioeconomic and maternal behavioral confounders (aim 1) generally attenuated associations, as cluster sizes halved and effect sizes substantially reduced. Cluster sizes further changed when including IQ and head motion (aim 2), however, we argue that adjustments might have introduced bias.\nCareful confounder selection and control can help identify more robust and specific regions of associations for ADHD symptoms, across two cohorts. We provided guidance to minimizing confounding bias in psychiatric neuroimaging.\nAuthors are supported by an NWO-VICI grant (NWO-ZonMW: 016.VICI.170.200 to HT) for HT, LDA, SL, and the Sophia Foundation S18-20, and Erasmus University and Erasmus MC Fellowship for RLM.", "Although still in its infancy, artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of kidney biopsy images is anticipated to become an integral aspect of renal histopathology. As these systems are developed, the focus will understandably be on developing ever more accurate models, but successful translation to the clinic will also depend upon other characteristics of the system.In the extreme, deployment of highly performant but \"black box\" AI is fraught with risk, and high-profile errors could damage future trust in the technology. Furthermore, a major factor determining whether new systems are adopted in clinical settings is whether they are \"trusted\" by clinicians. Key to unlocking trust will be designing platforms optimized for intuitive human-AI interactions and ensuring that, where judgment is required to resolve ambiguous areas of assessment, the workings of the AI image classifier are understandable to the human observer. Therefore, determining the optimal design for AI systems depends on factors beyond performance, with considerations of goals, interpretability, and safety constraining many design and engineering choices.In this article, we explore challenges that arise in the application of AI to renal histopathology, and consider areas where choices around model architecture, training strategy, and workflow design may be influenced by factors beyond the final performance metrics of the system.", "There are few studies on artificial intelligence-based prediction models for colon cancer built using clinicopathological factors. Here, we aimed to perform a preliminary evaluation of a novel artificial intelligence-based prediction model for surgical site infection (SSI) in patients with stage II-III colon cancer.\nThe medical records of 730 patients who underwent radical surgery for stage II-III colon cancer between 2000 and 2018 at our institute were retrospectively analyzed. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to examine the association between SSI and oncological outcomes (recurrence-free survival time). Next, we used the machine learning software Prediction One to predict SSI. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the accuracy of the artificial intelligence model.\nThe prognosis in terms of recurrence-free survival time was poor in patients with SSI (p=0.005, 95% confidence interval=4892.061-5525.251). The area under the curve of the artificial intelligence model in predicting SSI was 0.731.\nAs SSI is an important prognostic factor associated with oncological outcomes, the prediction of SSI occurrence is important. Based on our preliminary evaluation, the artificial intelligence model for predicting SSI in patients with stage II-III colon cancer was as accurate as the previously reported model derived through conventional statistical analysis.", "The emergency medical service is a fundamental part of healthcare, albeit crowded emergency rooms lead to delayed and low-quality assistance in actual urgent cases. Machine-learning algorithms can provide a smart and effective estimation of emergency patients' volume, which was previously restricted to artificial intelligence (AI) experts in coding and computer science but is now feasible by anyone without any coding experience through auto machine learning. This study aimed to create a machine-learning model designed by an ophthalmologist without any coding experience using AutoML to predict the influx in the emergency department and trauma cases.\nA dataset of 356,611 visits at Hospital da Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo from January 01, 2014 to December 31, 2019 was included in the model training, which included visits/day and the international classification disease code. The training and prediction were made with the Amazon Forecast by 2 ophthalmologists with no prior coding experience.\nThe forecast period predicted a mean emergency patient volume of 216.27/day in p90, 180.75/day in p50, and 140.35/day in p10, and a mean of 7.42 trauma cases/ day in p90, 3.99/day in p50, and 0.56/day in p10. In January of 2020, there were a total of 6,604 patient visits and a mean of 206.37 patients/day, which is 13.5% less than the p50 prediction. This period involved a total of 199 trauma cases and a mean of 6.21 cases/day, which is 55.77% more traumas than that by the p50 prediction.\nThe development of models was previously restricted to data scientists' experts in coding and computer science, but transfer learning autoML has enabled AI development by any person with no code experience mandatory. This study model showed a close value to the actual 2020 January visits, and the only factors that may have influenced the results between the two approaches are holidays and dataset size. This is the first study to apply AutoML in hospital visits forecast, showing a close prediction of the actual hospital influx.", "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus associated with elevated esophageal eosinophils. Second only to gastroesophageal reflux disease, EoE is one of the leading causes of chronic refractory dysphagia in adults and children. EoE is a clinicopathologic disorder and the histological portion of the diagnosis requires enumerating the density of esophageal eosinophils in esophageal biopsies, and evaluating additional features such as basal zone hyperplasia is helpful. However, this task requires time-consuming, somewhat subjective manual analysis, thus reducing the ability to process the complex tissue structure and infer its relationship with the patient's clinical status. Previous artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that aimed to improve histology-based diagnosis focused on recapitulating identification and quantification of the area of maximal eosinophil density, the gold standard manual metric for determining EoE disease activity. However, this metric does not account for the distribution of eosinophils or other histological features, over the whole slide image. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence platform that infers local and spatial biomarkers based on semantic segmentation of intact eosinophils and basal zone distributions. Besides the maximal density of eosinophils [referred to as Peak Eosinophil Count (PEC)] and a maximal basal zone fraction, we identify the value of two additional metrics that reflect the distribution of eosinophils and basal zone fractions. This approach enables a decision support system that predicts EoE activity and potentially classifies the histological severity of EoE patients. We utilized a cohort that includes 1,066 biopsy slides from 400 subjects to validate the system's performance and achieved a histological severity classification accuracy of 86.70%, sensitivity of 84.50%, and specificity of 90.09%. Our approach highlights the importance of systematically analyzing the distribution of biopsy features over the entire slide and paves the way toward a personalized decision support system that will assist not only in counting cells but can also potentially improve diagnosis and provide treatment prediction.", "Neurocognitive deficits are noted in anxiety disorders (ADs), albeit with several inconsistencies. The relationship between neurocognition and metacognition may have potential implications for understanding cognitive dysfunction but is poorly understood in ADs. This study aimed to examine the relationship between neurocognition and metacognition in ADs, with a cross-sectional design.\nThe sample included ADs (n = 25) and nonclinical (n = 25) groups matched on age, gender, and education. Neurocognition was assessed using tests for intelligence, attention, working memory, fluency, flexibility, set-shifting, inhibition, planning, and memory; and metacognition using Metacognition Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30) and Metacognitive Awareness and Regulation Scale (MARS).\nCompared to comparison/normative scores, the anxiety group showed significantly poorer performance on zoo map test (low demand trial; P = 0.007), rule shift cards 1 (P \u2264 0.001), rule shift cards 2 (P \u2264 0.001), and logical memory immediate recall (P \u2264 0.001) and delayed recall (P \u2264 0.001); greater negative beliefs about worry (P = 0.005), and poorer metacognitive awareness and regulation (P = 0.01). Greater cognitive self-consciousness was correlated with better planning (Spearman's rho = -0.509, P = 0.009).\nIndividuals with ADs show neurocognitive difficulties in planning, set-shifting, and logical memory, dysfunctional metacognition, and reduced metacognitive awareness and regulation. Cognitive self-consciousness is linked to better planning. The interrelationships between neurocognition and metacognition may have potential implications for clarifying inconsistent findings and designing novel cognitive interventions in ADs.", "The analysis of time series and images is significant across different fields due to their widespread applications. In the past few decades, many approaches have been developed, including data-driven artificial intelligence methods, mechanism-driven physical methods, and hybrid mechanism and data-driven models. Complex networks have been used to model numerous complex systems due to its characteristics, including time series prediction and image classification. In order to map time series and images into complex networks, many visibility graph algorithms have been developed, such as horizontal visibility graph, limited penetrable visibility graph, multiplex visibility graph, and image visibility graph. The family of visibility graph algorithms will construct different types of complex networks, including (un-) weighted, (un-) directed, and (single-) multi-layered networks, thereby focusing on different kinds of properties. Different types of visibility graph algorithms will be reviewed in this paper. Through exploring the topological structure and information in the network based on statistical physics, the property of time series and images can be discovered. In order to forecast (multivariate) time series, several variations of local random walk algorithms and different information fusion approaches are applied to measure the similarity between nodes in the network. Different forecasting frameworks are also proposed to consider the information in the time series based on the similarity. In order to classify the image, several machine learning models (such as support vector machine and linear discriminant) are used to classify images based on global features, local features, and multiplex features. Through various simulations on a variety of datasets, researchers have found that the visibility graph algorithm outperformed existing algorithms, both in time series prediction and image classification. Clearly, complex networks are closely connected with time series and images by visibility graph algorithms, rendering complex networks to be an important tool for understanding the characteristics of time series and images. Finally, we conclude in the last section with future outlooks for the visibility graph.", "Robotic surgical systems were created in part to solve several constraints of laparoscopic surgery and offer technical advantages. With a substantial body of evidence that demonstrates its efficacy in the treatment of rectal cancer, robotic surgery will soon become another conventional treatment. However, further investigations and randomized trials focusing on primary endpoints are needed to establish some advantages for robot-assisted colon surgery. Da Vinci Single-Site\u24c7 and SP\u24c7 platforms were developed to overcome the shortcomings of single-port laparoscopic surgery. Despite the currently insufficient evidence, it appears that the SP platform addresses many of the limitations of single-port transabdominal or transanal surgery. Robotic transanal minimally invasive surgery and total mesorectal excision were developed to overcome some of the limitations of conventional platforms, using wristed instrumentation to enhance dexterity and ergonomics. Studies on the effectiveness and viability of this novel approach are ongoing. The near-infrared fluorescence technique, real-time stereotactic navigation technology, and other surgical data platforms based on artificial intelligence incorporated into the robotic system will play an important role in improving outcomes. Robotic systems for advanced colorectal cancer offer technical advantages for complex and precise surgeries. If the cost of robotic surgery is reduced by expanding its indications and enhancing competition among different robotic platforms, it will provide clinical benefits to more patients and reduce social healthcare costs.", "Healthcare and technology, the fusion of these two distinct sciences can be traced back to the Vedic era. Regrettably, while it is evident that the journey of advancements in knowledge and innovation leading to the advent of technology to better the health of mankind is not a recent one, owing to inexistent means of transfer of knowledge, these contraptions stayed mostly localized to the regions of their inventors. This article seeks to review the vital role that technology has in bettering the health status of the global community and the\u00a0challenges\u00a0associated with healthcare technologies like inequity in connectivity, affordability, and accessibility. Technology and artificial intelligence are integrated to the best of the health systems across the world but\u00a0these advancements are not accessible to a considerable part of the global population. While affordability, the absence of a steady internet supply, and the lack of a device to use the technology are the major impediments causing this digital divide, cultural factors and health literacy also contribute to this scenario. Nevertheless, access to the internet has been recognized as a basic need by all governments around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic shook the health systems of developed and developing countries alike and has made every administration feel the urgency in making healthcare more accessible. Having seamless internet coverage and setups to make telemedicine or online consultations possible, can contribute significantly in paving the path to making our societies prosperous and healthier. With the world's consensus about this goal, efforts now should be focused on research and development for making these technologies more affordable and accessible without compromising their utility.", "Previous studies have paid more attention to the impact of non-balanced reciprocity in the organization on employees' behaviors and outcomes, and have expected that the reciprocity norm could improve employees' compliance behavior. However, there are two distinct types of non-balanced reciprocity, and whether generalized reciprocity affects employees' compliance behavior rather than negative reciprocity and its mechanisms has not been further explored so far. Building on the social exchange theory and cognitive appraisal theory, we established and examined a model in a scenario-based experiment across a two-stage survey of 316 participants. In this article, we propose that generalized reciprocity (relative to negative reciprocity) positively influences employees' compliance behavior, and thriving at work mediates its relationship. Furthermore, we argue that the positive association between generalized reciprocity and thriving at work is moderated by the perceived cognitive capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). This association is amplified for people high in the perceived cognitive capabilities of AI. We also propose that the positive association between thriving at work and compliance behavior is moderated by conscientiousness, such that the association is amplified for people high in conscientiousness. These findings have theoretical and practical implications.", "Proactive security plays a vital role in preventing the attack before entering active mode. In the modern information environment, it depends on the vulnerability management practitioners of an organization in which the critical factor is the prioritization of threats. The existing models and methodology follow the traditional approaches of a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to prioritize threats and vulnerabilities. The CVSS is not able to provide effectiveness to the security of the business of an organization. In contrast, the vulnerability analysis needs a model which can give significance to the prioritization policies. The model depends on the CVSS score of threats and compares various features of vulnerability like threat vectors, inputs, environments used by threat agent's groups, and potential outputs of threat agents. Therefore, the research aims to design a semi-automatic model for vulnerability analysis of threats for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database of cyber-crime. We have developed a semi-automatic model that simulates the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) list of the NIST database between 1999 and 2021, concerning the resources used by the threat agents, pre-requisites input, attack vectors, and dormant results. The semi-automatic approach of the model to perform the vulnerability analysis of threat agent groups identified in a network makes the model more efficient and effective to addresses the profiling of threat agents and evaluating the CTI (Critical Threat intelligence feed). Our experimental results imply that the semi-automatic model implements the vulnerability prioritization based on the CVSS score and uses the comparative analysis based on the threat agent's vectors identified. It also provides potency and optimized complexity to an organization's business to mitigate the vulnerability identified in a network.", "Multiple computer-aided techniques utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) have been created to improve the detection of polyps during colonoscopy and thereby reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. While adenoma detection rates (ADR) and polyp detection rates (PDR) are important colonoscopy quality indicators, adenoma miss rates (AMR) may better quantify missed lesions, which can ultimately lead to interval colorectal cancer. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of computer-aided colonoscopy (CAC) with respect to AMR, ADR, and PDR in randomized controlled trials.\nA comprehensive, systematic literature search was performed across multiple databases in September of 2022 to identify randomized, controlled trials that compared CAC with traditional colonoscopy. Primary outcomes were AMR, ADR, and PDR.\nFourteen studies totaling 10\u00a0928 patients were included in the final analysis. There was a 65% reduction in the adenoma miss rate with CAC (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.25-0.49, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, I2 \u00a0=\u00a050%). There was a 78% reduction in the sessile serrated lesion miss rate with CAC (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.65, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, I2 \u00a0=\u00a00%). There was a 52% increase in ADR in the CAC group compared with the control group (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.39-1.67, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04, I2 \u00a0=\u00a047%). There was 93% increase in the number of adenomas >\u00a010\u00a0mm detected per colonoscopy with CAC (OR 1.93; 95% CI, 1.18-3.16, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, I2 \u00a0=\u00a00%).\nThe results of the present study demonstrate the promise of CAC in improving AMR, ADR, PDR across a spectrum of size and morphological lesion characteristics.", "An appropriate ethical framework around the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has become a key desirable with the increasingly widespread deployment of this technology. Advances in AI hold the promise of improving the precision of outcome prediction at the level of the individual. However, the addition of these technologies to patient-clinician interactions, as with any complex human interaction, has potential pitfalls. While physicians have always had to carefully consider the ethical background and implications of their actions, detailed deliberations around fast-moving technological progress may not have kept up. We use a common but key challenge in healthcare interactions, the disclosure of bad news (likely imminent death), to illustrate how the philosophical framework of the 'Felicific Calculus' developed in the eighteenth century by Jeremy Bentham, may have a timely quasi-quantitative application in the age of AI. We show how this ethical algorithm can be used to assess, across seven mutually exclusive and exhaustive domains, whether an AI-supported action can be morally justified.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems leveraging speech and language changes could support timely detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nThe AMYPRED study (NCT04828122) recruited 133 subjects with an established amyloid beta (A\u03b2) biomarker (66 A\u03b2+, 67 A\u03b2-) and clinical status (71 cognitively unimpaired [CU], 62 mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or mild AD). Daily story recall tasks were administered via smartphones and analyzed with an AI system to predict MCI/mild AD and A\u03b2 positivity.\nEighty-six percent of participants (115/133) completed remote assessments. The AI system predicted MCI/mild AD (area under the curve [AUC]\u00a0=\u00a00.85, \u00b10.07) but not A\u03b2 (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.62\u00a0\u00b10.11) in the full sample, and predicted A\u03b2 in clinical subsamples (MCI/mild AD: AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.78 \u00b10.14; CU: AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.74 \u00b10.13) on short story variants (immediate recall). Long stories and delayed retellings delivered broadly similar results.\nSpeech-based testing offers simple and accessible screening for early-stage AD.", "Advances in natural language understanding have facilitated the development of Virtual Standardized Patients (VSPs) that may soon rival human patients in conversational ability. We describe herein the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for VSPs enabling students to practice their history taking skills.\nOur system consists of (1) Automated Speech Recognition (ASR), (2) hybrid AI for question identification, (3) classifier to choose between the two systems, and (4) automated speech generation. We analyzed the accuracy of the ASR, the two AI systems, the classifier, and student feedback with 620 first year medical students from 2018 to 2021.\nSystem accuracy improved from \u223c75% in 2018 to \u223c90% in 2021 as refinements in algorithms and additional training data were utilized. Student feedback was positive, and most students felt that practicing with the VSPs was a worthwhile experience.\nWe have developed a novel hybrid dialogue system that enables artificially intelligent VSPs to correctly answer student questions at levels comparable with human SPs. This system allows trainees to practice and refine their history-taking skills before interacting with human patients.", "The World Health Organization (WHO), in its last review of its International Classification of Diseases, established a new classification for chronic pain. Among the principal categories, of particular interest is chronic primary pain as a new type of diagnosis in those cases in which the etiology of the disease is not clear, being termed as chronic primary visceral pain when it is situated in the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis. Due to the novelty of the term, the objective of the systematic review was to examine the psychopathological and neuropsychological disorders associated with chronic primary visceral pain. We carried out a search of the scientific literature following the PRISMA directives using the Pubmed, Medline, PsycInfo and Scopus databases. A total of 33 articles were selected after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The analysis of the studies showed that most persons with chronic primary visceral pain suffer from at least one psychological disorder; the most prevalent being anxiety, depressive or somatoform disorders. The most frequent psychopathological symptoms are anxiety, depression and somatization. Similarly, the findings are insufficient to determine the existence of deficits in the domains of executive functioning, memory and intelligence. However, the existence of attention biases does seem to be clear. This review supposes a starting point for conceptualizing chronic primary visceral pain. It is necessary to continue further research so as to obtain a better understanding of this pathology and the disorders associated.", "As many parts of the world continue to fight the innumerable waves of COVID-19 infection, SARS-CoV-2 continues to sculpt its antigenic determinants to enhance its virulence and evolvability. Several vaccines were developed and used around the world, and oral antiviral medications are being developed against SARS-CoV-2. However, studies showed that the virus is mutating in line with the antibody's neutralization escape; thus, new therapeutic alternatives are solicited. We hereby review the key role that miRNAs can play as epigenetic mediators of the cross-talk between SARS-CoV-2 and the host cells. The limitations resulting from the \"virus intelligence\" to escape and antagonize the host miRNAs as well as the possible mechanisms that could be used in the viral evasion strategies are discussed. Lastly, we suggest new therapeutic approaches based on viral miRNAs.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are quickly gaining ground in healthcare and clinical decision-making. However, it is still unclear in what way AI can or should support decision-making that is based on incapacitated patients' values and goals of care, which often requires input from clinicians and loved ones. Although the use of algorithms to predict patients' most likely preferred treatment has been discussed in the medical ethics literature, no example has been realised in clinical practice. This is due, arguably, to the lack of a structured approach to the epistemological, ethical and pragmatic challenges arising from the design and use of such algorithms. The present paper offers a new perspective on the problem by suggesting that preference predicting AIs be viewed as sociotechnical systems with distinctive life-cycles. We explore how both known and novel challenges map onto the different stages of development, highlighting interdisciplinary strategies for their resolution.", "With the increasing demand for predictable and accountable Artificial Intelligence, the ability to explain or justify recommender systems results by specifying how items are suggested, or why they are relevant, has become a primary goal. However, current models do not explicitly represent the services and actors that the user might encounter during the overall interaction with an item, from its selection to its usage. Thus, they cannot assess their impact on the user's experience. To address this issue, we propose a novel justification approach that uses service models to (i) extract experience data from reviews concerning all the stages of interaction with items, at different granularity levels, and (ii) organize the justification of recommendations around those stages. In a user study, we compared our approach with baselines reflecting the state of the art in the justification of recommender systems results. The participants evaluated the Perceived User Awareness Support provided by our service-based justification models higher than the one offered by the baselines. Moreover, our models received higher Interface Adequacy and Satisfaction evaluations by users having different levels of Curiosity or low Need for Cognition (NfC). Differently, high NfC participants preferred a direct inspection of item reviews. These findings encourage the adoption of service models to justify recommender systems results but suggest the investigation of personalization strategies to suit diverse interaction needs.", "Digitalization and artificial intelligence increasingly affect the world of work. Rising risk of massive job losses have sparked technological fears. Limited income and productivity gains concentrated among a few tech companies are fueling inequalities. In addition, the increasing ecological footprint of digital technologies has become the focus of much discussion. This creates a trilemma of rising inequality, low productivity growth and high ecological costs brought by technological progress. How can this trilemma be resolved? Which digital applications should be promoted specifically? And what should policymakers do to address this trilemma? This contribution shows that policymakers should create suitable conditions to fully exploit the potential in the area of network applications (transport, information exchange, supply, provisioning) in order to reap maximum societal benefits that can be widely shared. This requires shifting incentives away from current uses toward those that can, at least partially, address the trilemma. The contribution analyses the scope and limits of current policy instruments in this regard and discusses alternative approaches that are more aligned with the properties of the emerging technological paradigm underlying the digital economy. In particular, it discusses the possibility of institutional innovations required to address the socio-economic challenges resulting from the technological innovations brought about by artificial intelligence.", "Callus induction is the first step in optimizing plant regeneration. Fit embryogenesis and shooting rely on callus induction. In addition, using artificial intelligence models in combination with an algorithm can be helpful in the optimization of in vitro culture. The present study aimed to evaluate the percentage and speed of callus induction optimization in carrot with a Multilayer Perceptron-Single point discrete genetic algorithm (GA).\nIn this study, the outputs included callus induction percentage and speed, while inputs were different types and concentrations of plant growth regulator (0. 5, 0.2\u00a0mg/l 2,4-D, 0.3, 0.2, 0.5\u00a0mg/l BAP, 1, 0.2\u00a0mg/l Kin, and 2\u00a0mg/l NAA), different explants (shoot, root, leaf, and nodal), a different concentration compound of MS medium (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009MS, 4\u00d7 MS, and 8\u00d7 MS) and time of sampling. The data were obtained in the laboratory, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF), two well-known ANNs, were employed to model. Then, GA was used for optimization, and sensitivity analysis was performed to indicate the inputs' importance.\nThe results showed that MLP had better prediction efficiency than RBF. Based on the results, R2 in training and testing data was 95 and 95% for the percentage of callus induction, while it was 94 and 95% for the speed of callus induction, respectively. In addition, a concentration compound of MS had high sensitivity, while times of sampling had low sensitivity. Based on the MLP-Single point discrete GA, the best results were obtained for shoot explants, 1\u00d7 MS media, and 0.5\u00a0mg/l 2, 4-D\u2009+\u20090.5\u00a0mg/l BAP. Further, a non-significant difference was observed between the test result and predicted MLP.\nGenerally, MLP-Single point discrete GA is considered a potent tool for predicting treatment and fit model results used in plant tissue culture and selecting the best medium for callus induction.", "Clinical translation is a challenging step in the development of cancer vaccines and is found to be related to the complex nature of cancer immunology. Vaccine-based therapeutic strategies for cancer have gained consideration with the advent of vaccine technology as well as an understanding of cancer immunology. Immunotherapy has been widely used in the treatment of cancer. Some promising candidates have been identified to engineer cancer vaccines like Glycoprotein, Mucin 1, MHC protein, etc. It has benefited from the availability of advanced techniques for rapid identification and selection of proteins for precision engineering. Simultaneously, nanovaccines have been focused on target delivery and artificial intelligence-based approaches for personalized vaccine development. The manuscript summarizes the advances in the development of structurebased cancer vaccines along with the status of clinical studies and applications.", "Many suggestions have been made as to the functions of the prefrontal (PF) cortex. However, they involve labelling areas using psychological terminology. But what we need to know is how the PF cortex operates. We argue that understanding this must start with describing the flow of information. We illustrate this argument by considering three PF areas. Each has a unique pattern of inputs and outputs, and we suggest that the implication is that each performs a unique transformation from the inputs to the outputs. The caudal PF cortex transforms input that is maintained by attention or short-term memory into the target of the appropriate eye movement. The mid-dorsal PF cortex transforms input concerning the order of objects or actions into the target of the appropriate eye and hand movements, thus supporting sequences of action. The ventral PF cortex transforms input concerning an object or sound into prospective activity that encodes the associated object or sound. However, it is important to appreciate that the mid-dorsal and ventral PF cortex are specialized for encoding abstract transformations, irrespective of the specific actions or objects. The advantage is that this enables generalization to novel problems that have the same underlying logic. We account for the difference between fast learning and slow learning in this way. The human brain has co-opted these mechanisms so as to support intelligence. Non-verbal tests of IQ typically use sequences of letters, numbers or designs. These test the ability to understand the abstract rules that apply. Here the activations lie in the mid-dorsal PF cortex. Verbal tests typically assess the ability to understand semantic associations. These can be presented either in pictorial or verbal form. Here the activations lie in the ventral PF cortex.", "Spatial metabolomics describes the spatially resolved analysis of interconnected pathways, biochemical reactions, and transport processes of small molecules in the spatial context of tissues and cells. However, a broad range of metabolite classes (e.g., steroids) show low intrinsic ionization efficiencies in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) experiments, thus restricting the spatial characterization of metabolic networks. Additionally, decomposing complex metabolite networks into chemical compound classes and molecular annotations remains a major bottleneck due to the absence of repository-scaled databases. Here, we describe a multimodal mass-spectrometry-based method combining computational metabolome mining tools and high-resolution on-tissue chemical derivatization (OTCD) MSI for the spatially resolved analysis of metabolic networks at the low micrometer scale. Applied to plant toxin sequestration in Danaus plexippus as a model system, we first utilized liquid chromatography (LC)-MS-based molecular networking in combination with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven chemical characterization to facilitate the structural elucidation and molecular identification of 32 different steroidal glycosides for the host-plant Asclepias curassavica. These comprehensive metabolite annotations guided the subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) analysis of cardiac-glycoside sequestration in D. plexippus. We developed a spatial-context-preserving OTCD protocol, which improved cardiac glycoside ion yields by at least 1 order of magnitude compared to results with untreated samples. To illustrate the potential of this method, we visualized previously inaccessible (sub)cellular distributions (2 and 5 \u03bcm pixel size) of steroidal glycosides in D. plexippus, thereby providing a novel insight into the sequestration of toxic metabolites and guiding future metabolomics research of other complex sample systems.", "To evaluate mammillary body abnormalities in school-age children without cerebral palsy treated with therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (cases) and matched controls, and associations with cognitive outcome, hippocampal volume, and diffusivity in the mammillothalamic tract (MTT) and fornix.\nMammillary body abnormalities were scored from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 32 cases and 35 controls (median age [interquartile range] 7\u2009years [6\u2009years 7\u2009months-7\u2009years 7\u2009months] and 7\u2009years 4\u2009months [6\u2009years 7\u2009months-7\u2009years 7\u2009months] respectively). Cognition was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition. Hippocampal volume (normalized by total brain volume) was measured from T1-weighted MRI. Radial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were measured in the MTT and fornix, from diffusion-weighted MRI using deterministic tractography.\nMore cases than controls had mammillary body abnormalities (34% vs 0%; p\u00a0<\u20090.001). Cases with abnormal mammillary bodies had lower processing speed (p\u00a0=\u20090.016) and full-scale IQ (p\u00a0=\u20090.028) than cases without abnormal mammillary bodies, and lower scores than controls in all cognitive domains (p\u00a0<\u20090.05). Cases with abnormal mammillary bodies had smaller hippocampi (left p\u00a0=\u20090.016; right p\u00a0=\u20090.004) and increased radial diffusivity in the right MTT (p\u00a0=\u20090.004) compared with cases without mammillary body abnormalities.\nCooled children with mammillary body abnormalities at school-age have reduced cognitive scores, smaller hippocampi, and altered MTT microstructure compared with those without mammillary body abnormalities, and matched controls.\nCooled children are at higher risk of mammillary body abnormalities than controls. Abnormal mammillary bodies are associated with reduced cognitive scores and smaller hippocampi. Abnormal mammillary bodies are associated with altered mammillothalamic tract diffusivity.", "Objective This scoping review maps the approach undertaken by nurses to influence the implementation of artificial intelligence in health care. It also provides evidence of how frequently nurses drive the implementation of artificial intelligence, and how often nurses collaborate within the technical team. Methods A systematic search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was undertaken from 24 July to 22 August 2020 to identify six records that met the inclusion criteria. Results Nurses influenced the implementation of artificial intelligence in health care by: problem solving; articulating contextual needs and priorities; providing real-world insight and solutions; providing examples of implementation; and determining end user satisfaction. There was one instance of nurses driving implementation, and four instances of nurses collaborating with a technical team approach. Conclusion The expertise of nurses must be sought to ensure artificial intelligence can effectively meet the highly context-specific demands of the healthcare environment.", "Social technology can improve the quality of older adults' social lives and mitigate negative mental and physical health outcomes associated with loneliness, but it should be designed collaboratively with this population. In this paper, we used participatory design (PD) methods to investigate how robots might be used as social facilitators for middle-aged and older adults (age 50+) in both the US and Japan. We conducted PD workshops in the US and Japan because both countries are concerned about the social isolation of these older adults due to their rapidly aging populations. We developed a novel approach to participatory design of future technologies that spends 2/3 of the PD session asking participants about their own life experiences as a foundation. This grounds the conversation in reality, creates rapport among the participants, and engages them in creative critical thinking. Then, we build upon this foundation, pose an abstract topic, and ask participants to brainstorm on the topic based on their previous discussion. In both countries, participants were eager to actively discuss design ideas for socially facilitative robots and imagine how they might improve their social lives. US participants suggested design ideas for telepresence robots, social distancing robots, and social skills artificial intelligence programs, while Japanese participants suggested ideas for pet robots, robots for sharing experiences, and easy-to-operate instructor robots. Comparing these two countries, we found that US participants saw robots as tools to help facilitate their social connections, while Japanese participants envisioned robots to function as surrogate companions for their parents and distract them from loneliness when they were unavailable. With this paper, we contribute to the literature in two main ways, presenting: (1) A novel approach to participatory design of future technologies that grounds participants in their everyday experience, and (2) Results of the study indicating how middle-aged and older adults from the US and Japan wanted technologies to improve their social lives. Although we conducted the workshops during the COVID-19 pandemic, many findings generalized to other situations related to social isolation, such as older adults living alone.", "Patient activation is defined as a patient's confidence and perceived ability to manage their own health. Patient activation has been a consistent predictor of long-term health and care costs, particularly for people with multiple long-term health conditions. However, there is currently no means of measuring patient activation from what is said in health care consultations. This may be particularly important for psychological therapy because most current methods for evaluating therapy content cannot be used routinely due to time and cost restraints. Natural language processing (NLP) has been used increasingly to classify and evaluate the contents of psychological therapy. This aims to make the routine, systematic evaluation of psychological therapy contents more accessible in terms of time and cost restraints. However, comparatively little attention has been paid to algorithmic trust and interpretability, with few studies in the field involving end users or stakeholders in algorithm development.\nThis study applied a responsible design to use NLP in the development of an artificial intelligence model to automate the ratings assigned by a psychological therapy process measure: the consultation interactions coding scheme (CICS). The CICS assesses the level of patient activation observable from turn-by-turn psychological therapy interactions.\nWith consent, 128 sessions of remotely delivered cognitive behavioral therapy from 53 participants experiencing multiple physical and mental health problems were anonymously transcribed and rated by trained human CICS coders. Using participatory methodology, a multidisciplinary team proposed candidate language features that they thought would discriminate between high and low patient activation. The team included service-user researchers, psychological therapists, applied linguists, digital research experts, artificial intelligence ethics researchers, and NLP researchers. Identified language features were extracted from the transcripts alongside demographic features, and machine learning was applied using k-nearest neighbors and bagged trees algorithms to assess whether in-session patient activation and interaction types could be accurately classified.\nThe k-nearest neighbors classifier obtained 73% accuracy (82% precision and 80% recall) in a test data set. The bagged trees classifier obtained 81% accuracy for test data (87% precision and 75% recall) in differentiating between interactions rated high in patient activation and those rated low or neutral.\nCoproduced language features identified through a multidisciplinary collaboration can be used to discriminate among psychological therapy session contents based on patient activation among patients experiencing multiple long-term physical and mental health conditions.", "Polymers with high conductivity and cross-linking ability are ideal materials for the preparation of conductive hydrogels for application in wearable electronic devices. However, the fabrication of conductive polymer-incorporated hydrogels with good synergistic properties remains a great challenge due to the hydrophobicity and opacity of conjugated \u03c0 conductive polymers. In this study, a multifunctional hybrid hydrogel was prepared by incorporating hemicellulose-decorated polypyrrole (H/PPY), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and tannic acid (TA) into a polyacrylamide (PAM) network. The addition of excess ammonium persulfate (APS) in the process of gelation not only initiated the polymerization of PAM but also resulted in the change of the hydrogel from opaque to transparent by continuously breaking and reducing the size of the PPY particles. The hybrid hydrogel exhibited high transparency and conductivity, good adhesion ability and mechanical performance, and high resistance strain sensitivity and could accurately monitor the strain signals of the index finger and elbow flexion and pulse beat during rest and exercise, which has promising potential for use in wearable or implantable smart sensor devices, electronic skins, and artificial intelligence applications.", "Adequate clinical evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms before adoption in practice is critical. Clinical evaluation aims to confirm acceptable AI performance through adequate external testing and confirm the benefits of AI-assisted care compared with conventional care through appropriately designed and conducted studies, for which prospective studies are desirable. This article explains some of the fundamental methodological points that should be considered when designing and appraising the clinical evaluation of AI algorithms for medical diagnosis. The specific topics addressed include the following: (a) the importance of external testing of AI algorithms and strategies for conducting the external testing effectively, (b) the various metrics and graphical methods for evaluating the AI performance as well as essential methodological points to note in using and interpreting them, (c) paired study designs primarily for comparative performance evaluation of conventional and AI-assisted diagnoses, (d) parallel study designs primarily for evaluating the effect of AI intervention with an emphasis on randomized clinical trials, and (e) up-to-date guidelines for reporting clinical studies on AI, with an emphasis on guidelines registered in the EQUATOR Network library. Sound methodological knowledge of these topics will aid the design, execution, reporting, and appraisal of clinical evaluation of AI.", "This study introduces and illustrates the potential of an integrated multi-omics approach in investigating the underlying biology of complex traits such as childhood aggressive behavior. In 645 twins (cases\u2009=\u200942%), we trained single- and integrative multi-omics models to identify biomarkers for subclinical aggression and investigated the connections among these biomarkers. Our data comprised transmitted and two non-transmitted polygenic scores (PGSs) for 15 traits, 78,772 CpGs, and 90 metabolites. The single-omics models selected 31 PGSs, 1614 CpGs, and 90 metabolites, and the multi-omics model comprised 44 PGSs, 746 CpGs, and 90 metabolites. The predictive accuracy for these models in the test (N\u2009=\u2009277, cases\u2009=\u200942%) and independent clinical data (N\u2009=\u2009142, cases\u2009=\u200945%) ranged from 43 to 57%. We observed strong connections between DNA methylation, amino acids, and parental non-transmitted PGSs for ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, intelligence, smoking initiation, and self-reported health. Aggression-related omics traits link to known and novel risk factors, including inflammation, carcinogens, and smoking.", "NAVIGATOR is an Italian regional project\u00a0boosting precision medicine in oncology with the aim of making it more predictive, preventive, and personalised by advancing translational research based on quantitative imaging and integrative omics analyses. The project's goal is to develop an open imaging biobank for the collection and preservation of a large amount of standardised imaging multimodal datasets, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography data, together with the corresponding patient-related and omics-related relevant information extracted from regional healthcare services using an adapted privacy-preserving model. The project is based on an open-source imaging biobank and an open-science oriented virtual research environment (VRE). Available integrative omics and multi-imaging data of three use cases (prostate cancer, rectal cancer, and gastric cancer) will be collected. All data confined in NAVIGATOR (i.e., standard and novel imaging biomarkers, non-imaging data, health agency data) will be used to create a digital patient model, to support the reliable prediction of the disease phenotype and risk stratification. The VRE that relies on a well-established infrastructure, called D4Science.org, will further provide a multiset infrastructure for processing the integrative omics data, extracting specific radiomic signatures, and for identification and testing of novel imaging biomarkers through big data analytics and artificial intelligence.", "In recent years, the volume of digitalized web-based information utilizing modern computer-based technology for data storage, processing, and analysis has grown rapidly. Humans can process a limited number of variables at any given time. Thus, the deluge of clinically useful information in the intensive care unit environment remains untapped. Innovations in machine learning technology with the development of deep neural networks and efficient, cost-effective data archival systems have provided the infrastructure to apply artificial intelligence on big data for determination of clinical events and outcomes. Here, we introduce a few computer-based technologies that have been tested across these domains.", "As machine learning (ML) solutions for genitourinary pathology image analysis are fostered by a progressively digitized laboratory landscape, these integrable modalities usher in a revolution in histopathological diagnosis. As technology advances, limitations stymying clinical artificial intelligence (AI) will not be extinguished without thorough validation and interrogation of ML tools by pathologists and regulatory bodies alike. ML solutions deployed in clinical settings for applications in prostate pathology yield promising results. Recent breakthroughs in clinical artificial intelligence for genitourinary pathology demonstrate unprecedented generalizability, heralding prospects for a future in which AI-driven assistive solutions may be seen as laboratory faculty, rather than novelty.", "Alongside the promise of improving clinical work, advances in healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) raise concerns about the risk of deskilling clinicians. This purpose of this study is to examine the issue of deskilling from the perspective of diverse group of professional stakeholders with knowledge and/or experiences in the development, deployment and regulation of healthcare AI.\nWe conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 72 professionals with AI expertise and/or professional or clinical expertise who were involved in development, deployment and/or regulation of healthcare AI. Data analysis using combined constructivist grounded theory and framework approach was performed concurrently with data collection.\nOur analysis showed participants had diverse views on three contentious issues regarding AI and deskilling. The first involved competing views about the proper extent of AI-enabled automation in healthcare work, and which clinical tasks should or should not be automated. We identified a cluster of characteristics of tasks that were considered more suitable for automation. The second involved expectations about the impact of AI on clinical skills, and whether AI-enabled automation would lead to worse or better quality of healthcare. The third tension implicitly contrasted two models of healthcare work: a human-centric model and a technology-centric model. These models assumed different values and priorities for healthcare work and its relationship to AI-enabled automation.\nOur study shows that a diverse group of professional stakeholders involved in healthcare AI development, acquisition, deployment and regulation are attentive to the potential impact of healthcare AI on clinical skills, but have different views about the nature and valence (positive or negative) of this impact. Detailed engagement with different types of professional stakeholders allowed us to identify relevant concepts and values that could guide decisions about AI algorithm development and deployment.", "Deciphering the relationship between molecules, olfactory receptors (ORs) and corresponding odors remains a challenging task. It requires a comprehensive identification of ORs responding to a given odorant. With the recent advances in artificial intelligence and the growing research in decoding the human olfactory perception from chemical features of odorant molecules, the applications of advanced machine learning have been revived. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network\u00a0(CNN) and Graphical Convolutional Network (GCN) models have been developed on odorant molecules-odors and odorant molecules-olfactory receptors using a large set of 5955 molecules, 160 odors and 106 olfactory receptors. The performance of such models is promising with a Precision/Recall Area Under Curve of 0.66 for the odorant-odor and 0.91 for the odorant-olfactory receptor GCN models respectively. Furthermore, based on the correspondence of odors and ORs associated for a set of 389 compounds, an odor-olfactory receptor pairwise score was computed for each odor-OR combination allowing to suggest a combinatorial relationship between olfactory receptors and odors. Overall, this analysis demonstrate that artificial intelligence may pave the way in the identification of the smell perception and the full repertoire of receptors for a given odorant molecule.", "While stroke is one of the leading causes of disability, the prediction of upper limb (UL) functional recovery following rehabilitation is still unsatisfactory, hampered by the clinical complexity of post-stroke impairment. Predictive models leading to accurate estimates while revealing which features contribute most to the predictions are the key to unveil the mechanisms subserving the post-intervention recovery, prompting a new focus on individualized treatments and precision medicine in stroke. Machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are emerging as the enabling technology in different fields, being promising tools also in clinics. In this study, we had the twofold goal of evaluating whether ML can allow deriving accurate predictions of UL recovery in sub-acute patients, and disentangling the contribution of the variables shaping the outcomes. To do so, Random Forest equipped with four XAI methods was applied to interpret the results and assess the feature relevance and their consensus. Our results revealed increased performance when using ML compared to conventional statistical approaches. Moreover, the features deemed as the most relevant were concordant across the XAI methods, suggesting good stability of the results. In particular, the baseline motor impairment as measured by simple clinical scales had the largest impact, as expected. Our findings highlight the core role of ML not only for accurately predicting the individual outcome scores after rehabilitation, but also for making ML results interpretable when associated to XAI methods. This provides clinicians with robust predictions and reliable explanations that are key factors in therapeutic planning/monitoring of stroke patients.", "Our aim is to find accurate and valid markers for diagnosis, prognosis, and the monitoring of treatment to improve outcome for patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. This search has led us into the disciplines of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence, as automatic analysis of spoken language may provide useful markers for psychiatry. Together with our language team at UMC Groningen and with great colleagues around the globe, we intend to push this field forward and provide tools that can support service users in self-monitoring and help clinicians with diagnosis, treatment monitoring and risk prediction.", "Flat urothelial lesions are important because of their potential for carcinogenesis and development into invasive urothelial carcinomas. However, it is difficult for pathologists to detect early flat urothelial changes and accurately diagnose flat urothelial lesions. To predict the pathologic diagnosis and molecular abnormalities of flat urothelial lesions from pathologic images, artificial intelligence with an interpretable method was used. Next-generation sequencing on 110 hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of normal urothelium and flat urothelial lesions, including atypical urothelium, dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ, detected 17 types of molecular abnormalities. To generate an interpretable prediction, a new method for segmenting urothelium and a new pathologic criteria-based artificial intelligence (PCB-AI) model was developed. \u03ba\u00a0Statistics and accuracy measurements were used to evaluate the ability of the model to predict the pathologic diagnosis. The likelihood ratio test was performed to evaluate the logistic regression models for predicting molecular abnormalities. The diagnostic prediction of the PCB-AI model was almost in perfect agreement with the pathologists' diagnoses (weighted \u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.98). PCB-AI significantly predicted some molecular abnormalities in an interpretable manner, including abnormalities of TP53 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), RB1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04), and ERCC2 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Thus, this study developed a new method of obtaining accurate urothelial segmentation, interpretable prediction of pathologic diagnosis, and interpretable prediction of molecular abnormalities.", "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common chronic disease with many serious complications. Celastrol can prevent and treat type 2 diabetes by reversing insulin resistance in a number of ways. However, the specific mechanisms by which celastrol prevents and treats T2D are not well understood. The aim of this study was to explore the key gene targets and potential signaling pathway mechanisms of celastrol for the treatment of T2D.\nGSE184050 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus online database. Blood samples from patients and healthy individuals with T2D were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed. Key gene analysis of DEGs was performed using the MCODE plugin in Cystoscope as well as the Hubba plugin, and intersections were taken to obtain hub genes, which were displayed using a Venn diagram. Enrichment analysis was then performed via the ClueGo plugin in Cytoscape and validated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The therapeutic targets of celastrol were then analyzed by pharmacophore network pharmacology, intersected to identify the therapeutic targets of celastrol, enriched for all targets, and intersected to obtain the signaling pathways for celastrol treatment. The protein structures of the therapeutic targets were predicted using the artificial intelligence AlphaFold2. Finally, molecular docking was used to verify whether celastrol could be successfully docked to the predicted targets.\n618 DEGs were obtained, and 9 hub genes for T2D were identified by the MCODE and Hubba plug-ins, including ADAMTS15, ADAMTS7, ADAMTSL1, SEMA5B, ADAMTS8, THBS2, HBB, HBD and HBG2. The DEG-enriched signaling pathways mainly included the ferroptosis and TGF-beta signaling pathways. A total of 228 target genes were annotated by pharmacophore target analysis, and the therapeutic targets were identified, including S100A11, RBP3, HBB, BMP7 and IQUB, and 9 therapeutic signaling pathways were obtained by an intersectional set. The protein structures of the therapeutic targets were successfully predicted by AlphaFold2, and docking was validated using molecular docking.\nCelastrol may prevent and treat T2D through key target genes, such as HBB, as well as signaling pathways, such as the TGF-beta signaling pathway and type II diabetes mellitus.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) software in radiology is becoming increasingly prevalent and performance is improving rapidly with new applications for given use cases being developed continuously, oftentimes with development and validation occurring in parallel. Several guidelines have provided reporting standards for publications of AI-based research in medicine and radiology. Yet, there is an unmet need for recommendations on the assessment of AI software before adoption and after commercialization. As the radiology AI ecosystem continues to grow and mature, a formalization of system assessment and evaluation is paramount to ensure patient safety, relevance and support to clinical workflows, and optimal allocation of limited AI development and validation resources before broader implementation into clinical practice. To fulfil these needs, we provide a glossary for AI software types, use cases and roles within the clinical workflow; list healthcare needs, key performance indicators and required information about software prior to assessment; and lay out examples of software performance metrics per software category. This conceptual framework is intended to streamline communication with the AI software industry and provide healthcare decision makers and radiologists with tools to assess the potential use of these software. The proposed software evaluation framework lays the foundation for a radiologist-led prospective validation network of radiology AI software. Learning Points: The rapid expansion of AI applications in radiology requires standardization of AI software specification, classification, and evaluation. The Canadian Association of Radiologists' AI Tech & Apps Working Group Proposes an AI Specification document format and supports the implementation of a clinical expert evaluation process for Radiology AI software.", "Cancer nanotechnologies possess immense potential as therapeutic and diagnostic treatment modalities and have undergone significant and rapid advancement in recent years. With this emergence, the complexities of data standards in the field are on the rise. Data sharing and reanalysis is essential to more fully utilize this complex, interdisciplinary information to answer research questions, promote the technologies, optimize use of funding, and maximize the return on scientific investments. In order to support this, various data-sharing portals and repositories have been developed which not only provide searchable nanomaterial characterization data, but also provide access to standardized protocols for synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials as well as cutting-edge publications. The National Cancer Institute's (NCI) caNanoLab is a dedicated repository for all aspects pertaining to cancer-related nanotechnology data. The searchable database provides a unique opportunity for data mining and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which aims to be an essential arm of future research studies, potentially speeding the design and optimization of next-generation therapies. It also provides an opportunity to track the latest trends and patterns in nanomedicine research. This manuscript provides the first look at such trends extracted from caNanoLab and compares these to similar metrics from the NCI's Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory, a laboratory providing preclinical characterization of cancer nanotechnologies to researchers around the globe. Together, these analyses provide insight into the emerging interests of the research community and rise of promising nanoparticle technologies.", "Rearranged X chromosomes in Turner syndrome (TS) generally present with a mild phenotype, but in cases of ring X chromosomes, the incidence of intellectual disability and other congenital abnormalities can be significantly higher depending on the size of the ring and the involvement of X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) region. Here, we report a 17-year-old female who was referred for a cytogenetic analysis because of primary amenorrhoea. The patient, of normal intelligence, had been found to have traits of TS, especially short stature and some rare findings such as horseshoe kidney and short fourth toe. Cytogenetic analysis showed a mosaic 45, X/46, X and r(X) karyotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis using sex chromosome probes permitted us to identify the marker as a ring X chromosome, detected in 30% of cells. The r(X) might include the XIST locus, which would have caused X-inactivation of this abnormal ring chromosome leading to mild phenotype in our patient but with atypical features present in the form of horseshoe kidney and short fourth toe.", "The adapted 6-step without interlock (A6Sw/oI) hand rub technique, commonly practiced in Japan, adds the \"wrist\" but omits the \"interlock\" step compared to the WHO 6-step technique (WHO6S). The first objective of this study was to assess the differences of the two techniques regarding surface coverage. The second objective was to analyze the coverage differences between hand sizes.\nHospital workers went under stratified quasi-randomization by glove size. The overall mean coverage, and the coverage of the sections of the hands were evaluated by fluorescent dye-based coverage assessment using a digital device with artificial intelligence technology.\nTotal of 427 workers were randomly allocated to WHO6S (N\u2009=\u2009215) or the A6Sw/oI (N\u2009=\u2009212). The overall mean dorsum coverage by WHO6S and A6Sw/oI was 90.6% versus 88.4% (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01), and the percentage of the participants with insufficient coverage of the backs of the four fingers ranged from 0.0-7.4% versus 28.2-51.4% (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). Dorsum coverage varied largely between hand size for both techniques, and significant differences were found between small and large hands.\nThe WHO6S was superior to the locally adapted technique regarding hand surface coverage. Hand size should be considered when assessing coverage differences between procedures. No trial registrations or fundings.", "Artificial intelligence enables simultaneous evaluation of plaque morphology and computational physiology from optical coherence tomography (OCT).\nThis study sought to appraise the predictive value of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by combined plaque morphology and computational physiology.\nA total of 604 patients with acute coronary syndrome who underwent OCT imaging in\u00a0\u22651 nonculprit vessel during index coronary angiography were retrospectively enrolled. A novel morphologic index, named the lipid-to-cap ratio (LCR), and a functional parameter to evaluate the physiologic significance of coronary stenosis from OCT, namely, the optical flow ratio (OFR), were calculated from OCT, together with classical morphologic parameters, like thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) and minimal lumen area.\nThe 2-year cumulative incidence of a composite of nonculprit vessel-related cardiac death, cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven revascularization (NCV-MACE) at 2 years was 4.3%. Both LCR (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.826; 95%\u00a0CI: 0.793-0.855) and OFR (AUC: 0.838; 95%\u00a0CI: 0.806-0.866) were superior to minimal lumen area (AUC: 0.618; 95%\u00a0CI: 0.578-0.657) in predicting NCV-MACE at 2 years. Patients with both an LCR of >0.33 and an OFR of\u00a0\u22640.84 had significantly higher risk of NCV-MACE at 2 years than patients in whom at least 1 of these 2 parameters was normal (HR: 42.73; 95%\u00a0CI: 12.80-142.60; P\u00a0< 0.001). The combination of thin-cap fibroatheroma and OFR also identified patients at higher risk of future events (HR: 6.58; 95%\u00a0CI: 2.83-15.33; P\u00a0< 0.001).\nThe combination of LCR with OFR permits the identification of a subgroup of patients with 43-fold higher risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in the nonculprit vessels after acute coronary syndrome.", "Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) was created to standardize reporting system for patients undergoing coronary CT angiography (CCTA) and to guide possible next steps in patient management. The goal of this updated 2022 CAD-RADS 2.0 is to improve the initial reporting system for CCTA by considering new technical developments in Cardiac CT, including data from recent clinical trials and new clinical guidelines. The updated CAD-RADS classification will follow an established framework of stenosis, plaque burden, and modifiers, which will include assessment of lesion-specific ischemia using CT fractional-flow-reserve (CT-FFR) or myocardial CT perfusion (CTP), when performed. Similar to the method used in the original CAD-RADS version, the determinant for stenosis severity classification will be the most severe coronary artery luminal stenosis on a per-patient basis, ranging from CAD-RADS 0 (zero) for absence of any plaque or stenosis to CAD-RADS 5 indicating the presence of at least one totally occluded coronary artery. Given the increasing data supporting the prognostic relevance of coronary plaque burden, this document will provide various methods to estimate and report total plaque burden. The addition of P1 to P4 descriptors are used to denote increasing categories of plaque burden. The main goal of CAD-RADS, which should always be interpreted together with the impression found in the report, remains to facilitate communication of test results with referring physicians along with suggestions for subsequent patient management. In addition, CAD-RADS will continue to provide a framework of standardization that may benefit education, research, peer-review, artificial intelligence development, clinical trial design, population health and quality assurance with the ultimate goal of improving patient care.

We recruited 119 BUC users who completed the entire survey. We leveraged structural equation modeling to capture the direct and indirect effects of \"AI Perception\" and \"Expectancy\" on clinicians' Intention to use the technology when mediated by \"Perceived Risk\".\nThe findings indicate a significant negative relationship concerning the direct impact of AI's perception on BUC Risk (\u00df\u2009=\u2009-0.23, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, Expectancy had a significant negative effect on Risk (\u00df\u2009=\u2009-0.49, p\u2009<\u20090.001). We also noted a significant negative impact of Risk on the Intent to use BUC (\u00df\u2009=\u2009-0.34, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Regarding the indirect effect of Expectancy on the Intent to Use BUC, the findings show a significant positive impact mediated by Risk (\u00df\u2009=\u20090.17, p\u2009=\u20090.004). The study noted a significant positive and indirect effect of AI Perception on the Intent to Use BUC when mediated by risk (\u00df\u2009=\u20090.08, p\u2009=\u20090.027). Overall, this study demonstrated the influences of expectancy, perceived risk, and perception of AI on clinicians' intent to use BUC (an AI system). AI developers need to emphasize the benefits of AI technology, ensure ease of use (effort expectancy), clarify the system's potential (performance expectancy), and minimize the risk perceptions by improving the overall design.\nIdentifying the factors that determine clinicians' intent to use AI-based decision support systems can help improve technology adoption and use in the healthcare domain. Enhanced and safe adoption of AI can uplift the overall care process and help standardize clinical decisions and procedures. An improved AI adoption in healthcare will help clinicians share their everyday clinical workload and make critical decisions.", "Ambient assisted living (AAL) is a common name for various artificial intelligence (AI)-infused applications and platforms that support their users in need in multiple activities, from health to daily living. These systems use different approaches to learn about their users and make automated decisions, known as AI models, for personalizing their services and increasing outcomes. Given the numerous systems developed and deployed for people with different needs, health conditions, and dispositions toward the technology, it is critical to obtain clear and comprehensive insights concerning AI models used, along with their domains, technology, and concerns, to identify promising directions for future work.\nThis study aimed to provide a scoping review of the literature on AI models in AAL. In particular, we analyzed specific AI models used in A\u0410L systems, the target domains of the models, the technology using the models, and the major concerns from the end-user perspective. Our goal was to consolidate research on this topic and inform end users, health care professionals and providers, researchers, and practitioners in developing, deploying, and evaluating future intelligent AAL systems.\nThis study was conducted as a scoping review to identify, analyze, and extract the relevant literature. It used a natural language processing toolkit to retrieve the article corpus for an efficient and comprehensive automated literature search. Relevant articles were then extracted from the corpus and analyzed manually. This review included 5 digital libraries: IEEE, PubMed, Springer, Elsevier, and MDPI.\nWe included a total of 108 articles. The annual distribution of relevant articles showed a growing trend for all categories from January 2010 to July 2022. The AI models mainly used unsupervised and semisupervised approaches. The leading models are deep learning, natural language processing, instance-based learning, and clustering. Activity assistance and recognition were the most common target domains of the models. Ambient sensing, mobile technology, and robotic devices mainly implemented the models. Older adults were the primary beneficiaries, followed by patients and frail persons of various ages. Availability was a top beneficiary concern.\nThis study presents the analytical evidence of AI models in AAL and their domains, technologies, beneficiaries, and concerns. Future research on intelligent AAL should involve health care professionals and caregivers as designers and users, comply with health-related regulations, improve transparency and privacy, integrate with health care technological infrastructure, explain their decisions to the users, and establish evaluation metrics and design guidelines.\nPROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022347590; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022347590.", "Fake news and disinformation (FNaD) are increasingly being circulated through various online and social networking platforms, causing widespread disruptions and influencing decision-making perceptions. Despite the growing importance of detecting fake news in politics, relatively limited research efforts have been made to develop artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) oriented FNaD detection models suited to minimize supply chain disruptions (SCDs). Using a combination of AI and ML, and case studies based on data collected from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan, we developed a FNaD detection model aimed at preventing SCDs. This model based on multiple data sources has shown evidence of its effectiveness in managerial decision-making. Our study further contributes to the supply chain and AI-ML literature, provides practical insights, and points to future research directions.", "As urbanization increases across the globe, urban flooding is an ever-pressing concern. Urban fluvial systems are highly complex, depending on a myriad of interacting variables. Numerous hydraulic models are available for analyzing urban flooding; however, meeting the demand of high spatial extension and finer discretization and solving the physics-based numerical equations are computationally expensive. Computational efforts increase drastically with an increase in model dimension and resolution, preventing current solutions from fully realizing the data revolution. In this research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, machine learning (ML) methods including the emerging deep learning (DL) to quantify urban flooding considering the lower part of Darby Creek, PA, USA. Training datasets comprise multiple geographic and urban hydraulic features (e.g., coordinates, elevation, water depth, flooded locations, discharge, average slope, and the impervious area within the contributing region, downstream distance from stormwater outfalls and dams). ML Classifiers such as logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) are used to identify the flooded locations. A\u00a0Deep neural network (DNN)-based regression model is used to quantify the water depth. The values of the evaluation matrices indicate satisfactory performance both for the\u00a0classifiers and DNN model (F-1 scores- 0.975, 0.991, 0.892, and 0.855 for binary classifiers; root mean squared error- 0.027 for DNN regression). In addition, the blocked K-folds Cross Validation (CV) of ML classifiers in detecting flooded locations showed satisfactory performance with the average accuracy of 0.899, which validates the models to generalize to the unseen area. This approach is a significant step towards resolving the complexities of urban fluvial flooding with a large multi-dimensional dataset in a highly computationally efficient manner.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly infiltrating multiple areas in medicine, with gastrointestinal endoscopy paving the way in both research and clinical applications. Multiple challenges associated with the incorporation of AI in endoscopy are being addressed in recent consensus documents.\nIn the current paper, we aimed to map future challenges and areas of research for the incorporation of AI in capsule endoscopy (CE) practice.\nModified three-round Delphi consensus online survey.\nThe study design was based on a modified three-round Delphi consensus online survey distributed to a group of CE and AI experts. Round one aimed to map out key research statements and challenges for the implementation of AI in CE. All queries addressing the same questions were merged into a single issue. The second round aimed to rank all generated questions during round one and to identify the top-ranked statements with the highest total score. Finally, the third round aimed to redistribute and rescore the top-ranked statements.\nTwenty-one (16 gastroenterologists and 5 data scientists) experts participated in the survey. In the first round, 48 statements divided into seven themes were generated. After scoring all statements and rescoring the top 12, the question of AI use for identification and grading of small bowel pathologies was scored the highest (mean score 9.15), correlation of AI and human expert reading-second (9.05), and real-life feasibility-third (9.0).\nIn summary, our current study points out a roadmap for future challenges and research areas on our way to fully incorporating AI in CE reading.", "COVID-19 has caused tectonic changes in the personal and professional lives of anesthesiologists and, among several aspects, anesthesiology residency and sub-specialty training has also undergone an unforeseen overhaul. We read the articles published on the impact of COVID-19 on training of anesthesiologists and set out to extract and narrate all the significant observations. At the outset, we begin by explaining how this pandemic posed a threat to the safety of the residents and mitigating measures like PPE and barriers that have now become 'the new normal'. Sub-specialties like critical care, cardiac anesthesia, pain and palliative care have also faced difficulty in imparting training due to an initial dearth in elective surgery case load but have adapted innovative measures to overcome that. Initially, conducting thesis and research became difficult due to problems in achieving the desires sample size needed to get significant results, but this pandemic has emerged as a dynamic laboratory where topics like 'psychological impact of COVID-19' and 'development of artificial intelligence models in COVID -19 ICUs' came into the fore. Pattern of examination has also become virtual and webinars showed how knowledge, with the right medium, has the potential of global outreach. As the pandemic took a toll on the mental health of the residents, attention was paid to this previously neglected aspect and ensuring their emotional well-being became a priority to avoid the issue of burn-out. We comment on how what initially was considered a scary problem, actually paved way for growth. It brought attention to safety, innovation, new tools for training, finding solutions within constraints, continuing developing our residents into future leaders who were also trained for mitigating disasters. Changes like online education, research on socio-economic impact, priority to mental health and artificial intelligence are here to stay and by imbibing it, we ensure that 'the show must go on'.", "As Big Data Analysis meets healthcare applications, domain-specific challenges and opportunities materialize in all aspects of data science. Advanced statistical methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are used both for knowledge discovery purposes and clinical decision support. Such techniques enable the emerging Predictive, Preventative, Personalized, and Participatory Medicine (P4M) paradigm. Working with the Infectious Disease Clinic of the University Hospital of Modena, Italy, we have developed a range of Data-Driven (DD) approaches to solve critical clinical applications using statistics, Machine Learning (ML) and Big Data Analytics on real-world EHR. Here, we describe our perspective on the challenges we encountered. Some are connected to medical data and their sparse, scarce, and unbalanced nature. Others are bound to the application environment, as medical AI tools can affect people's health and life. For each of these problems, we report some available techniques to tackle them, present examples drawn from our experience, and propose which approaches, in our opinion, could lead to successful real-world, end-to-end implementations.\nDESY-22-153.", "Diabetic foot complications have multiple adverse effects in a person's quality of life. Yet, efficient monitoring schemes can mitigate or postpone any disorders, mainly by early detecting regions of interest. Nowadays, optical sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) tools can contribute efficiently to such monitoring processes. In this work, we provide information on the adopted imaging schemes and related optical sensors on this topic. The analysis considers both the physiology of the patients and the characteristics of the sensors. Currently, there are multiple approaches considering both visible and infrared bands (multiple ranges), most of them coupled with various AI tools. The source of the data (sensor type) can support different monitoring strategies and imposes restrictions on the AI tools that should be used with. This review provides a comprehensive literature review of AI-assisted DFU monitoring methods. The paper presents the outcomes of a large number of recently published scholarly articles. Furthermore, the paper discusses the highlights of these methods and the challenges for transferring these methods into a practical and trustworthy framework for sufficient remote management of the patients.", "Cognitive decline is a gradual neurodegenerative process that is affected by genetic and environmental factors. The doctor-patient relationship in the healthcare for cognitive decline is in a \"shallow\" medical world. With the development of data science, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and digital twin, the introduction of the concept of the metaverse in medicine has brought alternative and complementary strategies in the intervention of cognitive decline. This article technically analyzes the application scenarios and paradigms of the metaverse in medicine in the field of mental health, such as hospital management, diagnosis, prediction, prevention, rehabilitation, progression delay, assisting life, companionship, and supervision. The metaverse in medicine has made primary progress in education, immersive consultation, dental disease, and Parkinson's disease, bringing revolutionary prospects for non-pharmacological complementary treatment of cognitive decline and other mental problems. In particular, with the demand for non-face-to-face communication generated by the global COVID-19 epidemic, the needs for uncontactable healthcare service for the elderly have increased. The paradigm of self-monitoring, self-healing, and healthcare experienced by the elderly through the metaverse in medicine, especially from meta-platform, meta-community, and meta-hospital, will be generated, which will reconstruct the service modes for the elderly people. The future map of the metaverse in medicine is huge, which depends on the co-construction of community partners.", "Tumor vaccination is a promising approach for tumor immunotherapy because it presents high specificity and few side effects. However, tumor vaccines that contain only a single tumor antigen can allow immune system evasion by tumor variants. Tumor antigens are complex and heterogeneous, and identifying a single antigen that is uniformly expressed by tumor cells is challenging. Whole tumor cells can produce comprehensive antigens that trigger extensive tumor-specific immune responses. Therefore, tumor cells are an ideal source of antigens for tumor vaccines. A better understanding of tumor cell-derived vaccines and their characteristics, along with the development of new technologies for antigen delivery, can help improve vaccine design. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in tumor cell-derived vaccines in cancer immunotherapy and highlight the different types of engineered approaches, mechanisms, administration methods, and future perspectives. We discuss tumor cell-derived vaccines, including whole tumor cell components, extracellular vesicles, and cell membrane-encapsulated nanoparticles. Tumor cell-derived vaccines contain multiple tumor antigens and can induce extensive and potent tumor immune responses. However, they should be engineered to overcome limitations such as insufficient immunogenicity and weak targeting. The genetic and chemical engineering of tumor cell-derived vaccines can greatly enhance their targeting, intelligence, and functionality, thereby realizing stronger tumor immunotherapy effects. Further advances in materials science, biomedicine, and oncology can facilitate the clinical translation of tumor cell-derived vaccines.", "The potential for the use of artificial intelligence in developing lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) has received a good deal of attention from ethicists. Lines of argument in favor of and against developing and deploying LAWS have already become hardened. In this paper, I examine one strategy for skirting these familiar positions, namely to base an anti-LAWS argument not on claims that LAWS inevitably fail to respect human dignity, but on a different kind of respect, namely respect for public opinion and conventional attitudes (which Robert Sparrow claims are strongly anti-LAWS). My conclusion is that this sort of respect for conventional attitudes does provide some reason for actions and policies, but that it is actually a fairly weak form of respect, that is often override by more direct concerns about respect for humanity or dignity. By doing this, I explain the intuitive force of the claim that one should not disregard public attitudes, but also justify assigning a relatively weak role when other kinds of respect are involved.", "Consumers' inclinations towards materialism and compulsive buying are influenced by a variety of factors. Materialistic consumers face maladies that cause stress and lower subjective well-being and are unable to control their buying behaviour that in turn leads to social and financial issues. This paper aims to investigate the effect of emotional intelligence training on consumers' materialism and compulsive buying. The experimental design involves 36 respondents across both groups. Findings confirm the hypothesis that ability-based training programmes can help consumers improve their emotional intelligence whilst also lowering their levels of materialism and compulsive buying. In sum, the results extend the existing literature on consumer materialism by providing an explanation on how specific emotional ability-based training can diminish materialistic and excessive buying inclinations. The development of emotional intelligence skills-based training programmes contributes to more sustainable consumer behaviour, mitigating the vulnerability to materialism and related addictive behavioural consequences.", "Machine learning was a highly effective tool in model construction. We aim to establish a machine learning-based predictive model for predicting the cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC).\nWe obtained data on PTMC from the SEER database, including 10 demographic and clinicopathological characteristics. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression (LR) analyses were applied to screen the risk factors for cervical LNM in PTMC. Risk factors with P\u2009<\u20090.05 in multivariate LR analysis were used as modeling variables. Five different machine learning (ML) algorithms including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gaussian naive bayes (GNB) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and traditional regression analysis were used to construct the prediction model. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to compare the model performance.\nThrough univariate and multivariate LR analysis, we screened out 9 independent risk factors most closely associated with cervical LNM in PTMC, including age, sex, race, marital status, region, histology, tumor size, and extrathyroidal extension (ETE) and multifocality. We used these risk factors to build an ML prediction model, in which the AUROC value of the XGBoost algorithm was higher than the other 4 ML algorithms and was the best ML model. We optimized the XGBoost algorithm through 10-fold cross-validation, and its best performance on the training set (AUROC: 0.809, 95%CI 0.800-0.818) was better than traditional LR analysis (AUROC: 0.780, 95%CI 0.772-0.787).\nML algorithms have good predictive performance, especially the XGBoost algorithm. With the continuous development of artificial intelligence, ML algorithms have broad prospects in clinical prognosis prediction.", "The aim of this study was to investigate an eccentric distance (ED) zone analysis system for regional evaluation of the cephalic fixator tip based on the ED of the cephalic fixator tip referenced to the radius of its own femoral head to predict cut-out in intertrochanteric fractures (ITF) with internal fixation.\nFirst, we assumed all the femoral heads were regular spheres with the radius (R FD) of \"3\" for a complete match of the Cleveland zone system and calculated the ED of the cephalic fixator tip by measuring the distances from the cephalic fixator tip to the geometric central axis in the femoral neck and head on both anteroposterior (AP) view and lateral view radiographs. Second, we defined the maximum transverse section of the femoral head into three zones named ED Zone A with ED less than \"1,\" Zone B with ED ranging in \"1-2,\" and Zone C with ED ranging in \"2-3\" in turns by concentric circles (circles A, B, and C) with the radius of 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3 times of R FD, respectively. Third, we evaluated the ED zones according to the ED and location of the cephalic fixator tip in the eligible 123 ITF patients with single-screw cephalomedullary nail (SCMN) fixation and then analyzed the correlation between the cut-out rate and the ED zones.\nThe cut-out rates in ED Zones A, B, and C were 4.17%, 38.46%, and 100%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that ED Zone A had at least a 14 times lower rate of cut-out compared with ED Zone B. The cephalic fixator tip located in ED Zone A has a lower cut-out rate than that in Cleveland Zone 5. The cut-out rate in ED Zone A is significantly lower than that in the region inside Cleveland Zone 5 but outside ED Zone A.\nED zone analysis system is a reliable regional evaluation of the cephalic fixator tip position for predicting cut-out in geriatric ITF patients with SCMN fixations and potentially an artificial intelligence measurement during surgery. For decreasing the cut-out rate, the cephalic fixator tip should be located in ED Zone A.", "This paper proposes a new meta-heuristic algorithm, named wild geese migration optimization (GMO) algorithm. It is inspired by the social behavior of wild geese swarming in nature. They maintain a special formation for long-distance migration in small groups for survival and reproduction. The mathematical model is established based on these social behaviors to solve optimization problems. Meanwhile, the performance of the GMO algorithm is tested on the stable benchmark function of CEC2017, and its potential for dealing with practical problems is studied in five engineering design problems and the inverse kinematics solution of robot. The test results show that the GMO algorithm has excellent computational performance compared to other algorithms. The practical application results show that the GMO algorithm has strong applicability, more accurate optimization results, and more competitiveness in challenging problems with unknown search space, compared with well-known algorithms in the literature. The proposal of GMO algorithm enriches the team of swarm intelligence optimization algorithms and also provides a new solution for solving engineering design problems and inverse kinematics of robots.", "To implement an all-day artificial intelligence (AI)-based system to facilitate chest pain triage in the emergency department.\nThe AI-based triage system encompasses an AI model combining a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory to detect ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on electrocardiography (ECG) and a clinical risk score (ASAP) to prioritize patients for ECG examination. The AI model was developed on 2907 twelve-lead ECGs: 882 STEMI and 2025 non-STEMI ECGs.\nBetween November 1, 2019, and October 31, 2020, we enrolled 154 consecutive patients with STEMI: 68 during the AI-based triage period and 86 during the conventional triage period. The mean \u00b1 SD door-to-balloon (D2B) time was significantly shortened from 64.5\u00b135.3 minutes to 53.2\u00b112.7 minutes (P=.007), with 98.5% vs 87.2% (P=.009) of D2B times being less than 90 minutes in the AI group vs the conventional group. Among patients with an ASAP score of 3 or higher, the median door-to-ECG time decreased from 30 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 7-59 minutes) to 6 minutes (IQR, 4-30 minutes) (P<.001). The overall performances of the AI model in identifying STEMI from 21,035 ECGs assessed by accuracy, precision, recall, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, F1 score, and specificity were 0.997, 0.802, 0.977, 0.999, 0.881, and 0.998, respectively.\nImplementation of an all-day AI-based triage system significantly reduced the D2B time, with a corresponding increase in the percentage of D2B times less than 90 minutes in the emergency department. This system may help minimize preventable delays in D2B times for patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention.", "Sepsis is regarded as a risk factor for brain injury in preterm infants. We herein hypothesize that extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWI, birth weight <1,000 g) having survived recurrent blood culture-proven late-onset sepsis (LOS) episodes are more likely to have an adverse long-term neurologic outcome.\nIn a large multicenter observational study of ELBWI \u226428 6/7 weeks, we evaluated the impact of recurrent LOS (blood culture-proven, after day 7 of life) on development at 5-6 years. Neurodevelopment, behavior, and motor qualities were tested by blinded investigators. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed.\nThe cohort consisted of 1343 ELBWI including 1,080 infants without LOS, 186 infants with one LOS, and 77 with recurrent LOS, i.e., 55 infants with two and 22 infants with three LOS episodes. After Bonferroni-Holm correction, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed recurrent sepsis to be significantly associated with adverse motor development (critical MABC-2 testing: 3.3 [1.5-7.3], p = 0.003, pB = 0.012), whereas no significant impact of recurrent LOS was found on intelligence quotient and behavioral difficulties. Odds of having critical motor testing results for infants with recurrent LOS were 1.7 times (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.3) that of infants with one LOS.\nRecurrent sepsis in preterm infants is associated with adverse long-term motor development. However, infants with recurrent infections are also more likely to have preterm-related complications, and reasons for a worse neurodevelopmental outcome remain to be elucidated.", "The grade of hepatic steatosis is assessed semi-quantitatively and graded as a discrete value. However, the proton density fat fraction (PDFF) measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and FF measured by MR spectroscopy (FFMRS) are continuous values. Therefore, a quantitative histopathologic method may be needed. This study aimed to (I) provide a spectrum of values of MRI-PDFF, FFMRS, and FFs measured by two different histopathologic methods [artificial intelligence (AI) and pathologist], (II) to evaluate the correlation among them, and (III) to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRI-PDFF and MRS for grading hepatic steatosis.\nForty-seven patients who underwent liver biopsy and MRI for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) evaluation were included. The agreement between MRI-PDFF and MRS was evaluated through Bland-Altman analysis. Correlations among MRI-PDFF, MRS, and two different histopathologic methods were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The diagnostic performance of MRI-PDFF and MRS was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses and the area under the curve (AUC) were obtained.\nThe means\u00b1standard deviation of MRI-PDFF, FFMRS, FF measured by pathologist (FFpathologist), and FF measured by AI (FFAI) were 12.04\u00b16.37, 14.01\u00b16.16, 34.26\u00b119.69, and 6.79\u00b14.37 (%), respectively. Bland-Altman bias [mean of MRS - (MRI-PDFF) differences] was 2.06%. MRI-PDFF and MRS had a very strong correlation (r=0.983, P<0.001). The two different histopathologic methods also showed a very strong correlation (r=0.872, P<0.001). Both MRI-PDFF and MRS demonstrated a strong correlation with FFpathologist (r=0.701, P<0.001 and r=0.709, P<0.001, respectively) and with FFAI (r=0.700, P<0.001 and r=0.690, P<0.001, respectively). The AUCs of MRI-PDFF for grading \u2265S2 and \u2265S3 were 0.846 and 0.855, respectively. The AUCs of MRS for grading \u2265S2 and \u2265S3 were 0.860 and 0.878, respectively.\nSince MRS and MRI-PDFF demonstrated a strong correlation with each other and with the two different histopathologic methods, they can be used as an alternative noninvasive reference standard in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. However, these preliminary results should be interpreted with caution until they are validated in further studies.", "The PET scanners with long axial field of view (AFOV) having\u2009~\u200920 times higher sensitivity than conventional scanners provide new opportunities for enhanced parametric imaging but suffer from the dramatically increased volume and complexity of dynamic data. This study reconstructed a high-quality direct Patlak Ki image from five-frame sinograms without input function by a deep learning framework based on DeepPET to explore the potential of artificial intelligence reducing the acquisition time and the dependence of input function in parametric imaging.\nThis study was implemented on a large AFOV PET/CT scanner (Biograph Vision Quadra) and twenty patients were recruited with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) dynamic scans. During training and testing of the proposed deep learning framework, the last five-frame (25\u00a0min, 40-65\u00a0min post-injection) sinograms were set as input and the reconstructed Patlak Ki images by a nested EM algorithm on the vendor were set as ground truth. To evaluate the image quality of predicted Ki images, mean square error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) were calculated. Meanwhile, a linear regression process was applied between predicted and true Ki means on avid malignant lesions and tumor volume of interests (VOIs).\nIn the testing phase, the proposed method achieved excellent MSE of less than 0.03%, high SSIM, and PSNR of\u2009~\u20090.98 and\u2009~\u200938\u00a0dB, respectively. Moreover, there was a high correlation (DeepPET: [Formula: see text]= 0.73, self-attention DeepPET: [Formula: see text]=0.82) between predicted Ki and traditionally reconstructed Patlak Ki means over eleven lesions.\nThe results show that the deep learning-based method produced high-quality parametric images from small frames of projection data without input function. It has much potential to address the dilemma of the long scan time and dependency on input function that still hamper the clinical translation of dynamic PET.", "Existing public health emergencies due to fatal/infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and monkeypox have raised the paradigm of 5th generation portable intelligent and multifunctional biosensors embedded on a single chip. The state-of-the-art 5th generation biosensors are concerned with integrating advanced functional materials with controllable physicochemical attributes and optimal machine processability. In this direction, 2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes), owing to their enhanced effective surface area, tunable physicochemical properties, and rich surface functionalities, have shown promising performances in biosensing flatlands. Moreover, their hybridization with diversified nanomaterials caters to their associated challenges for the commercialization of stability due to restacking and oxidation. MXenes and its hybrid biosensors have demonstrated intelligent and lab-on-chip prospects for determining diverse biomarkers/pathogens related to fatal and infectious diseases. Recently, on-site detection has been clubbed with solution-on-chip MXenes by interfacing biosensors with modern-age technologies, including 5G communication, internet-of-medical-things (IoMT), artificial intelligence (AI), and data clouding to progress toward hospital-on-chip (HOC) modules. This review comprehensively summarizes the state-of-the-art MXene fabrication, advancements in physicochemical properties to architect biosensors, and the progress of MXene-based lab-on-chip biosensors toward HOC solutions. Besides, it discusses sustainable aspects, practical challenges and alternative solutions associated with these modules to develop personalized and remote healthcare solutions for every individual in the world.", "Gastric cancer is one of the common malignant tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, and surgery is currently an important treatment for progressive gastric cancer. With the development of technology, the simultaneous maturation of artificial intelligence (AI), fifth-generation (5G) telecommunication networks and the internet of things (IOT) has brought significant efficacy and new opportunities for the surgical treatment of gastric malignancies. The combination of 5G network and remote surgical robotic system is the future trend of radical gastric cancer surgery, and the \"unmanned\" treatment mode of fully automated robotic gastric cancer radical surgery will be realized soon.", "Audiovisual communication is greatly contributing to the emerging research field of affective computing. The use of audiovisual stimuli within immersive virtual reality environments is providing very intense emotional reactions, which provoke spontaneous physical and physiological changes that can be assimilated into real responses. In order to ensure high-quality recognition, the artificial intelligence (AI) system must be trained with adequate data sets, including not only those gathered by smart sensors but also the tags related to the elicited emotion. Currently, there are very few techniques available for the labeling of emotions. Among them, the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) devised by Lang is one of the most popular. This study shows experimentally that the graphic proposal for the original SAM labelling system, as devised by Lang, is not neutral to gender and contains gender biases in its design and representation. Therefore, a new graphic design has been proposed and tested according to the guidelines of expert judges. The results of the experiment show an overall improvement in the labeling of emotions in the pleasure-arousal-dominance (PAD) affective space, particularly, for women. This research proves the relevance of applying the gender perspective in the validation of tools used throughout the years.", "Current diagnosis and classification of thyroid nodules are susceptible to subjective factors. Despite widespread use of ultrasonography (USG) and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) to assess thyroid nodules, the interpretation of results is nuanced and requires specialist endocrine surgery input. Using readily available pre-operative data, the aims of this study were to develop artificial intelligence (AI) models to classify nodules into likely benign or malignant and to compare the diagnostic performance of the models.\nPatients undergoing surgery for thyroid nodules between 2010 and 2020 were recruited from our institution's database into training and testing groups. Demographics, serum TSH level, cytology, ultrasonography features and histopathology data were extracted. The training group USG images were re-reviewed by a study radiologist experienced in thyroid USG, who reported the relevant features and supplemented with data extracted from existing reports to reduce sampling bias. Testing group USG features were extracted solely from existing reports to reflect real-life practice of a non-thyroid specialist. We developed four AI models based on classification algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Na\u00efve Bayes) and evaluated their diagnostic performance of thyroid malignancy.\nIn the training group (n\u2009=\u2009857), 75% were female and 27% of cases were malignant. The testing group (n\u2009=\u2009198) consisted of 77% females and 17% malignant cases. Mean age was 54.7\u2009\u00b1\u200916.2\u00a0years for the training group and 50.1\u2009\u00b1\u200917.4\u00a0years for the testing group. Following validation with the testing group, support vector machine classifier was found to perform best in predicting final histopathology with an accuracy of 89%, sensitivity 89%, specificity 83%, F-score 94% and AUROC 0.86.\nWe have developed a first of its kind, pilot AI model that can accurately predict malignancy in thyroid nodules using USG features, FNAC, demographics and serum TSH. There is potential for a model like this to be used as a decision support tool in under-resourced areas as well as by non-thyroid specialists.", "The analytes qualified as biomarkers are potent tools to diagnose various diseases, monitor therapy responses, and design therapeutic interventions. The early assessment of the diverseness of human disease is essential for the speedy and cost-efficient implementation of personalized medicine. We developed g3mclass, the Gaussian mixture modeling software for molecular assay data classification. This software automates the validated multiclass classifier applicable to single analyte tests and multiplexing assays. The g3mclass achieves automation using the original semi-constrained expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that allows inference from the test, control, and query data that human experts cannot interpret. In this study, we used real-world clinical data and gene expression datasets (ERBB2, ESR1, PGR) to provide examples of how g3mclass may help overcome the problems of over-/underdiagnosis and equivocal results in diagnostic tests for breast cancer. We showed the g3mclass output's accuracy, robustness, scalability, and interpretability. The user-friendly interface and free dissemination of this multi-platform software aim to ease its use by research laboratories, biomedical pharma, companion diagnostic developers, and healthcare regulators. Furthermore, the g3mclass automatic extracting information through probabilistic modeling is adaptable for blending with machine learning and artificial intelligence.", "Bisphenol A (BPA), a typical endocrine disruptor and a contaminant of emerging concern (CECs), has detrimental impacts not only on the environment and ecosystems, but also on human health. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the degrading processes of BPA in order to diminish its persistent effects on ecological environmental safety. With this objective, the present study reports on the effectiveness of biotic/abiotic factors in optimizing BPA removal and evaluates the kinetic models of the biodegradation processes. The results showed that BPA affected chlorophyll a, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and photosystem intrinsic PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm) in the microalga Chlorella pyrenoidosa, which degraded 43.0 % of BPA (8.0 mg L-1) under general experimental conditions. The bacteria consortium AEF21 could remove 55.4 % of BPA (20 mg L-1) under orthogonal test optimization (temperature was 32 \u00b0C, pH was 8.0, inoculum was 6.0 %) and the prediction of artificial neural network (ANN) of machine learning (R2 equal to 0.99 in training, test, and validation phase). The microalgae-bacteria consortia have a high removal rate of 57.5 % of BPA (20.0 mg L-1). The kinetic study revealed that the removal processes of BPA by microalgae, bacteria, and microalgae-bacteria consortia all followed the Monod's kinetic model. This work provided a new perspective to apply artificial intelligence to predict the degradation of BPA and to understand the kinetic processes of BPA biodegradation by integrated biological approaches, as well as a novel research strategy to achieve environmental CECs elimination for long-term ecosystem health.", "COVID-19 infected millions of people and increased mortality worldwide. Patients with suspected COVID-19 utilised emergency medical services (EMS) and attended emergency departments, resulting in increased pressures and waiting times. Rapid and accurate decision-making is required to identify patients at high-risk of clinical deterioration following COVID-19 infection, whilst also avoiding unnecessary hospital admissions. Our study aimed to develop artificial intelligence models to predict adverse outcomes in suspected COVID-19 patients attended by EMS clinicians.\nLinked ambulance service data were obtained for 7,549 adult patients with suspected COVID-19 infection attended by EMS clinicians in the Yorkshire and Humber region (England) from 18-03-2020 to 29-06-2020. We used support vector machines (SVM), extreme gradient boosting, artificial neural network (ANN) models, ensemble learning methods and logistic regression to predict the primary outcome (death or need for organ support within 30 days). Models were compared with two baselines: the decision made by EMS clinicians to convey patients to hospital, and the PRIEST clinical severity score.\nOf the 7,549 patients attended by EMS clinicians, 1,330 (17.6%) experienced the primary outcome. Machine Learning methods showed slight improvements in sensitivity over baseline results. Further improvements were obtained using stacking ensemble methods, the best geometric mean (GM) results were obtained using SVM and ANN as base learners when maximising sensitivity and specificity.\nThese methods could potentially reduce the numbers of patients conveyed to hospital without a concomitant increase in adverse outcomes. Further work is required to test the models externally and develop an automated system for use in clinical settings.", "The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has grown in the past 10 years. Despite the crucial role of laboratory diagnostics in clinical decision-making, we found that the majority of AI studies focus on surgery, radiology, and oncology, and there is little attention given to AI integration into laboratory medicine.\nWe dedicated a session at the 3rd annual European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (EFLM) strategic conference in 2022 to the topic of AI in the laboratory of the future. The speakers collaborated on generating a concise summary of the content that is presented in this paper.\nThe five key messages are (1) Laboratory specialists and technicians will continue to improve the analytical portfolio, diagnostic quality and laboratory turnaround times; (2) The modularized nature of laboratory processes is amenable to AI solutions; (3) Laboratory sub-specialization continues and from test selection to interpretation, tasks increase in complexity; (4) Expertise in AI implementation and partnerships with industry will emerge as a professional competency and require novel educational strategies for broad implementation; and (5) regulatory frameworks and guidances have to be adopted to new computational paradigms.\nIn summary, the speakers opine that the ability to convert the value-proposition of AI in the laboratory will rely heavily on hands-on expertise and well designed quality improvement initiative from within laboratory for improved patient care.", "In knowledge transfer for educational purposes, most cancer hospital or center websites have existing information on cancer health. However, such information is usually a list of topics that are neither interactive nor customized to offer any personal touches to people facing dire health crisis and to attempt to understand the concerns of the users. Patients with cancer, their families, and the general public accessing the information are often in challenging, stressful situations, wanting to access accurate information as efficiently as possible. In addition, there is seldom any comprehensive information specifically on radiotherapy, despite the large number of older patients with cancer, to go through the treatment process. Therefore, having someone with professional knowledge who can listen to them and provide the medical information with good will and encouragement would help patients and families struggling with critical illness, particularly during the lingering pandemic.\nThis study created a novel virtual assistant, a chatbot that can explain the radiation treatment process to stakeholders comprehensively and accurately, in the absence of any similar software. This chatbot was created using the IBM Watson Assistant with artificial intelligence and machine learning features. The chatbot or bot was incorporated into a resource that can be easily accessed by the general public.\nThe radiation treatment process in a cancer hospital or center was described by the radiotherapy process: patient diagnosis, consultation, and prescription; patient positioning, immobilization, and simulation; 3D-imaging for treatment planning; target and organ contouring; radiation treatment planning; patient setup and plan verification; and treatment delivery. The bot was created using IBM Watson (IBM Corp) assistant. The natural language processing feature in the Watson platform allowed the bot to flow through a given conversation structure and recognize how the user responds based on recognition of similar given examples, referred to as intents during development. Therefore, the bot can be trained using the responses received, by recognizing similar responses from the user and analyzing using Watson natural language processing.\nThe bot is hosted on a website by the Watson application programming interface. It is capable of guiding the user through the conversation structure and can respond to simple questions and provide resources for requests for information that was not directly programmed into the bot. The bot was tested by potential users, and the overall averages of the identified metrics are excellent. The bot can also acquire users' feedback for further improvements in the routine update.\nAn artificial intelligence-assisted chatbot was created for knowledge transfer regarding radiation treatment process to the patients with cancer, their families, and the general public. The bot that is supported by machine learning was tested, and it was found that the bot can provide information about radiotherapy effectively.", "To examine the need for information and communication technology (ICT)-based nursing care in improving patient management during the pandemic.\nMaintaining traditional approaches to nursing in the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic predisposes health care systems to a risk of diminished quality of care. Using ICT (real-time videoconferencing, mobile robots and artificial intelligence) could reduce burnout and infection risks by minimizing face-to-face contact.\nQualitative descriptive design with content analysis.\nOverall, 24 participants (14 nurses, six medical/nursing informatics experts and four technology experts) were interviewed. Three main themes were extracted: emerging challenges for nurses due to COVID-19, impact of new technology on patient and nurse experiences and concerns with implementation of technology.\nA significant portion of nurses' work was unrelated to professional nursing, causing burnout. ICT could help reduce nurses' burden by facilitating environmental management and non-contact communication and providing emotional support for patients.\nEstablishing an ICT-based nursing care system that considers the physical environment and communication infrastructure of health care institutions, user's digital health literacy and user safety to effectively manage non-nursing care-related activities and undertake tasks that can be delegated may improve the quality of care for quarantined patients and reduce risk of cross-infection.", "To explore work readiness among newly graduated nurses transitioning to practice in Saudi Arabia.\nMany challenges encounter newly graduated nurses when transitioning to practice. Higher work readiness has been associated with smooth transitioning to practice. However, little is known about work readiness among newly graduated nurses in Saudi Arabia.\nCross-sectional convenience sample of 174 participants.\nThe mean score in work readiness was 338.8 (SD\u2009=\u200969.6). Weekly working hours correlated with organizational acumen (r\u00a0=\u20090.208, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), social intelligence (r\u00a0=\u20090. 217, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), work competence (r\u00a0=\u00a00.173, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) and the number of weeks since the start of internship training (r\u00a0=\u00a00.180, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). There were significant mean differences in a) personal work characteristics based on the country (t\u00a0=\u20095.582, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and university from which they graduated (f\u00a0=\u200915.618, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); b) organizational acumen based on having a second job (t\u00a0=\u2009-2.18, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), university from which they graduated (f\u00a0=\u20091.837, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and whether the hospital was the first-choice preference (t\u00a0=\u2009- 2.837, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and nursing was the first choice of study (t\u00a0=\u2009-2.879, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005); and c) work competence based on the university from which they graduated (f\u00a0=\u20095.267, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006).\nThe findings showed the work readiness of newly graduated nurses in Saudi Arabia's context.\nFindings have important implications for nurse managers to better design and implement a transition to practice programs for newly graduated nurses to improve their preparedness in their nursing careers.", "The ensuing pilot investigation sheds new light on characterizing tumoral and non-tumoral human skin mechanical properties that will not only assist the dermatologist's diagnosis but also could constitute the creation of an Artificial Intelligence database for upcoming research. A modern, non-invasive, and contact-free methodology-UNDERSKIN-was developed, and hinges upon Fourier transform computations that permit the analysis of surface wave dispersion with a specific skin inversion model and viscoelastic model. It yields a detailed look at how particle movements of the medium propagate throughout its near sub-surface, hence a novel knowledge of the mechanical responses of skin tumors. The research results display the tumors' viscoelastic responses alongside their respective healthy skin outcomes for each skin layer as well as the dermatologist's touch analysis. Although dermatologists are capable of sensing and having a fair overall assessment of what they are palpating, they are unable heretofore to quantify it and inform where the firmness or softness derives from, which it is necessary to be acquainted with so as to perform an accurate diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, future surgery, and teledermatology.", "In this paper, a bibliometric analysis of research on wearable technologies for cardiovascular diseases was conducted with Bibliometrix and based on 1675 papers collected in Scopus from 2000 to 2022, and interesting results were presented. The US and China stood out for their sustained productivity in the field of cardiovascular diseases. The examination of the authors' keywords revealed that between 2000-01 and 2009-12, \"Respiration\" and \"personalized applications\" were the most popular research topics, however from 2010-01 to 2019-12, attention was given to \"ECG,\" \"Wearable devices,\" \"Wearable sensors,\" and \"heart rate\". This study suggests that in the present decade, researchers should focus on topics related to artificial intelligence, hypertension, ECG, wearable sensors, and African countries must address their technological gap in the coming years.", "This perspective article draws a distinction between some of the well-known drug classification systems and a \"Chemistry Classification System\" (CCS). Rather than have drug classification based on some simple properties like solubility and permeability or route of systemic elimination, a CCS results in more than four or five classes and each class has distinct properties that impact formulation development. This perspective provides and outline of 13 classes, but a CCS is a flexible system that introduces a thought process for classification. The number of classes is not rigid, and chemists are encouraged to adapt these methods to their own situations. A CCS utilizes machine-learning models and artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate physicochemical properties that result in unique, frequently observed dissolution, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) properties to guide formulation development.", "Equity is widely held to be fundamental to the ethics of healthcare. In the context of clinical decision-making, it rests on the comparative fidelity of the intelligence - evidence-based or intuitive - guiding the management of each individual patient. Though brought to recent attention by the individuating power of contemporary machine learning, such epistemic equity arises in the context of any decision guidance, whether traditional or innovative. Yet no general framework for its quantification, let alone assurance, currently exists. Here we formulate epistemic equity in terms of model fidelity evaluated over learnt multidimensional representations of identity crafted to maximise the captured diversity of the population, introducing a comprehensive framework for Representational Ethical Model Calibration. We demonstrate the use of the framework on large-scale multimodal data from UK Biobank to derive diverse representations of the population, quantify model performance, and institute responsive remediation. We offer our approach as a principled solution to quantifying and assuring epistemic equity in healthcare, with applications across the research, clinical, and regulatory domains.", "To evaluate the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology literacy course on participants from nine radiology residency programs in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic United States.\nA week-long AI in radiology course was developed and included participants from nine radiology residency programs in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic United States. Ten 30 minutes lectures utilizing a remote learning format covered basic AI terms and methods, clinical applications of AI in radiology by four different subspecialties, and special topics lectures on the economics of AI, ethics of AI, algorithm bias, and medicolegal implications of AI in medicine. A proctored hands-on clinical AI session allowed participants to directly use an FDA cleared AI-assisted viewer and reporting system for advanced cancer. Pre- and post-course electronic surveys were distributed to assess participants' knowledge of AI terminology and applications and interest in AI education.\nThere were an average of 75 participants each day of the course (range: 50-120). Nearly all participants reported a lack of sufficient exposure to AI in their radiology training (96.7%, 90/93). Mean participant score on the pre-course AI knowledge evaluation was 8.3/15, with a statistically significant increase to 10.1/15 on the post-course evaluation (p= 0.04). A majority of participants reported an interest in continued AI in radiology education in the future (78.6%, 22/28).\nA multi-institutional AI in radiology literacy course successfully improved AI education of participants, with the majority of participants reporting a continued interest in AI in radiology education in the future.", "Accurate risk assessment and insight into which factors are associated with recidivism are essential for forensic correctional practice. Therefore, we investigated whether the Historical, Clinical, and Future-Revised (HKT-R [Historisch Klinisch Toekomst-Revised]) risk assessment instrument could predict violent recidivism over a 2-year follow-up period in forensic psychiatric patients with intelligence quotient (IQ) < 80. We refer to these patients as intellectually disabled (ID) and patients with IQ \u2265 80 as non-ID. Additionally, the associations of the 14 clinical HKT-R factors with ID versus non-ID group membership were investigated, as well as a possible moderating role of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) in these associations. The final sample encompassed 748 forensic psychiatric patients (15.9% were patients with ID) who were unconditionally released from highly secured Dutch forensic psychiatric institutions between 2004 and 2014. The results showed that the HKT-R total score (AUC = 0.705, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.527, 0.882]) and the clinical domain (AUC = 0.733, 95% CI [0.579, 0.886]) had a large effect size for predictive validity for 2-year violent recidivism, while the future domain (AUC = 0.653, 95% CI [0.524, 0.781]) and the historical domain (AUC = 0.585, 95% CI [0.397, 0.772]) had a medium effect size for predictive validity for 2-year violent recidivism in ID patients. It was also found that lower levels of self-reliance and social skills were associated with ID, indicating that treatment should prioritize these skills. However, ACE was not associated with ID, nor did it moderate the associations of the clinical HKT-R factors with ID. This study contributes to the understanding of both risk assessment and treatment of forensic psychiatric patients with ID.", "Spleen is the most vulnerable organ in abdominal trauma. Ultrasound (US) has become an important examination method for splenic trauma. However, the sensitivity of routine US in the diagnosis of splenic trauma is low. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can improve the sensitivity, but it also has some limitations. This study sought to explore the application value of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted US in the classification of splenic trauma.\nThe splenic injuries of Bama miniature pigs were established. A large number of ultrasonic images were collected. Then, 3-fold cross validation (CV) was used to establish the animal models. Next, clinical ultrasonic images were collected at multiple centers. All injuries were diagnosed by CEUS, enhanced CT or surgery. We used animal models to fine tune a small amount of human data, and then established the final AI splenic trauma recognition model. The whole model was constructed by averaging the prediction ability of the 3 fine-tuned models. Finally, 2 doctors' recognition US results of splenic trauma were compared to the AI recognition results. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance in diagnosis of spleen trauma.\n(I) Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the test cohort 1 (AUC =0.90) and 2 (AUC =0.84) had a similar performance. Based on the decision curve analysis (DCA) curves, while threshold smaller than 0.8, the proposed model had better performance on test cohort 1 than test cohort 2. Test cohort 1 had higher sensitivity (0.82 vs. 0.71, P<0.01) and higher specificity (0.88 vs. 0.81, P<0.01) than test cohort 2. (II) The diagnostic accuracy of the AI model was higher than that of doctor 1 (0.82 vs. 0.62, P<0.001) and doctor 2 (0.82 vs. 0.66, P<0.001), and its specificity was higher than that of doctor (0.88 vs. 0.78, P=0.001).\nAI-assisted US diagnosis of splenic trauma can significantly improve the ultrasonic diagnosis rate. We still need to increase the number of samples to further improve the diagnostic efficiency of the model.", "In the field of cancer detection, technologies to analyze tumors using biomarkers circulating in fluids such as blood have developed rapidly based on liquid biopsy. A proactive approach to early cancer detection can lead to more effective treatments with minimal side effects and better long-term patient survival. However, early detection of cancer is hindered by the existing limitations of conventional cancer diagnostic methods. To enable early diagnosis and regular monitoring and improve automation, the development of integrated point-of-care (POC) and biosensors is needed. This is expected to fundamentally change the diagnosis, management, and monitoring of response to treatment of cancer. POC-based techniques will provide a way to avoid complications that occur after invasive tissue biopsy, such as bleeding, infection, and pain. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive view of biosensors and their clinical relevance in oncology for the detection of biomarkers with liquid biopsies of proteins, miRNA, ctDNA, exosomes, and cancer cells. The preceding discussion also illustrates the changing landscape of liquid biopsy-based cancer diagnosis through nanomaterials, machine learning, artificial intelligence, wearable devices, and sensors, many of which apply POC design principles. With the advent of sensitive, selective, and timely detection of cancer, we see the field of POC technology for cancer detection and treatment undergoing a positive paradigm shift in the foreseeable future.", "Virtual Assistants, also known as conversational artificial intelligence, are transforming the reality around us. These virtual assistants have challenged our daily lives by assisting us in the different dimensions of our lives, such as health, entertainment, home, and education, among others. The main purpose of this study is to develop and empirically test a model to predict factors that affect users' behavioral intentions when they use intelligent virtual assistants. As a theoretical basis for investigating behavioral intention of using virtual assistants from the consumers' perspective, researchers employed the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2). For this research paper, seven variables were analyzed: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, hedonic motivation, habit, and price/value. In order to improve consumer behavior prediction, three additional factors were included in the study: perceived privacy risk, trust, and personal innovativeness. Researchers carried out an online survey with 304 responses. The obtained sample was analyzed with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) through IBM SPSS V. 27.0 and AMOS V 27.0. The main study results reveal that factors, such as habit, trust, and personal innovation, have a significant impact on the adoption of virtual assistants. However, on the other side, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, hedonic motivation, price/value, and perceived privacy risk were not significant factors in the users' intention to adopt this service. This research paper examines the effect of personal innovation, security, and trust variables in relation to the use of virtual assistants. It contributes to a more holistic understanding of the adoption of these intelligent devices and tries to fill the knowledge gap on this topic, as it is an emerging technology. This investigation also provides relevant information on how to successfully implement these technologies.", "Air pollution is increasing for many reasons, such as the crowding of cities, the failure of planning to consider the benefit of society and nature, and the non-implementation of environmental legislation. In the recent era, the impacts of air pollution on human health and the ecosystem have become a primary global concern. Thus, the prediction of air pollution is a crucial issue. ANFIS is an artificial intelligence technique consisting of artificial neural networks and fuzzy inference systems, and it is widely used in estimating studies. To obtain effective results with ANFIS, the training process, which includes optimizing its premise and consequent parameters, is very important. In this study, ANFIS training has been performed using three popular metaheuristic methods: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Differential Evolution (DE) for modeling air pollution. Various air pollution parameters which are particular matters: PM2.5 and PM10, sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and several meteorological parameters such as wind speed, wind gust, temperature, pressure, and humidity were utilized. Daily air pollution predictions in Istanbul were obtained using these particular matters and parameters via trained ANFIS approaches with metaheuristics. The prediction results from GA, PSO, and DE-trained ANFIS were compared with classical ANFIS results. In conclusion, it can be said that the trained ANFIS approaches are more successful than classical ANFIS for modeling and predicting air pollution.", "Objective To build a prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction model based on common clinical indicators to provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of PCa and to evaluate the value of artificial intelligence (AI) technology under healthcare data platforms. Methods After preprocessing of the data from Population Health Data Archive, smuothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) was used to select features. Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BP), and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to predict the risk of PCa, among which BP and CNN were used on the enhanced data by SMOTE. The performances of models were compared using area under the curve (AUC) of the receiving operating characteristic curve. After the optimal model was selected, we used the Shiny to develop an online calculator for PCa risk prediction based on predictive indicators. Results Inorganic phosphorus, triglycerides, and calcium were closely related to PCa in addition to the volume of fragmented tissue and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Among the four models, RF had the best performance in predicting PCa (accuracy: 96.80%; AUC: 0.975, 95% CI: 0.964-0.986). Followed by BP (accuracy: 85.36%; AUC: 0.892, 95% CI: 0.849-0.934) and SVM (accuracy: 82.67%; AUC: 0.824, 95% CI: 0.805-0.844). CNN performed worse (accuracy: 72.37%; AUC: 0.724, 95% CI: 0.670-0.779). An online platform for PCa risk prediction was developed based on the RF model and the predictive indicators. Conclusions This study revealed the application value of traditional machine learning and deep learning models in disease risk prediction under healthcare data platform, proposed new ideas for PCa risk prediction in patients suspected for PCa and had undergone core needle biopsy. Besides, the online calculation may enhance the practicability of AI prediction technology and facilitate medical diagnosis.", "Rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep neural networks has resulted in artificial systems such as generative pre-trained transformer 3 (GPT-3), which can generate human-like language. Such a system may provide a novel platform for studying how human perception is related to knowledge and the ability of language generation. We compared the frequency distribution of basic color terms in the answers of human subjects and GPT-3 when both were asked similar questions regarding color names associated with the letters of the alphabet. We found that GPT-3 generated basic color terms at a frequency very similar to that of human non-synaesthetes. A similar frequency was observed when color names associated with numerals were tested indicating that simple co-occurrence of alphabet and color word in the trained dataset cannot explain the results. We suggest that the proposed experimental framework using the latest AI models has the potential to explore the mechanisms of human perception.", "Kidney organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) contain multilineage nephrogenic progenitor cells and can recapitulate the development of the kidney. Kidney organoids derived from hPSCs have the potential to be applied in regenerative medicine as well as renal disease modeling, drug screening, and nephrotoxicity testing. Despite biotechnological advances, individual differences in morphological and growth characteristics among kidney organoids need to be addressed before clinical and commercial application. In this study, we hypothesized that an automated noninvasive method based on deep learning of bright-field images of kidney organoids can predict their differentiation status.\nBright-field images of kidney organoids were collected on day 18 after differentiation. To train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we utilized a transfer learning approach. CNNs were trained to predict the differentiation of kidney organoids on bright-field images based on the messenger RNA expression of renal tubular epithelial cells as well as podocytes.\nThe best prediction model was DenseNet121 with a total Pearson correlation coefficient score of 0.783 on a test dataset. W classified the kidney organoids into two categories: organoids with above-average gene expression (Positive) and those with below-average gene expression (Negative). Comparing the best-performing CNN with human-based classifiers, the CNN algorithm had a receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.85, while the experts had an AUC score of 0.48.\nThese results confirmed our original hypothesis and demonstrated that our artificial intelligence algorithm can successfully recognize the differentiation status of kidney organoids.", "In the present work, we prepared MgO-La2O3-mixed-metal oxides (MMO) as efficient photocatalysts for degradation of organic pollutants. First, a series of MgAl-%La-CO3-layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors with different contents of La (5, 10, and 20 wt%) were synthesized by the co-precipitation process and then calcined at 600\u00a0\u00b0C. The prepared materials were characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX, FTIR, TGA, ICP, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. XRD indicated that MgO, La2O3, and MgAl2O4 phases were found to coexist in the calcined materials. Also, XRD confirms the orthorhombic-tetragonal phases of MgO-La2O3. The samples exhibited a small band gap of 3.0-3.22\u00a0eV based on DRS. The photocatalytic activity of the catalysts was assessed for the degradation of two dyes, namely, tartrazine (TZ) and patent blue (PB) as model organic pollutants in aqueous mediums under UV-visible light. Detailed photocatalytic tests that focused on the impacts of dopant amount of La, catalyst dose, initial pH of the solution, irradiation time, dye concentration, and reuse were carried out and discussed in this research. The experimental findings reveal that the highest photocatalytic activity was achieved with the MgO-La2O3-10% MMO with photocatalysts with a degradation efficiency of 97.4% and 93.87% for TZ and PB, respectively, within 150\u00a0min of irradiation. The addition of La to the sample was responsible for its highest photocatalytic activity. Response surface methodology (RSM) and gradient boosting regressor (GBR), as artificial intelligence techniques, were employed to assess individual and interactive influences of initial dye concentration, catalyst dose, initial pH, and irradiation time on the degradation performance. The GBR technique predicts the degradation efficiency results with R2\u2009=\u20090.98 for both TZ and PB. Moreover, ANOVA analysis employing CCD-RSM reveals a high agreement between the quadratic model predictions and the experimental results for TZ and PB (R2\u2009=\u20090.9327 and Adj-R2\u2009=\u20090.8699, R2\u2009=\u20090.9574 and Adj-R2\u2009=\u20090.8704, respectively). Optimization outcomes indicated that maximum degradation efficiency was attained under the following optimum conditions: catalyst dose 0.3\u00a0g/L, initial dye concentration 20\u00a0mg/L, pH 4, and reaction time 150\u00a0min. On the whole, this study confirms that the proposed artificial intelligence (AI) techniques constituted reliable and robust computer techniques for monitoring and modeling the photodegradation of organic pollutants from aqueous mediums by MgO-La2O3-MMO heterostructure catalysts.", "To analyse various corneal nerve parameters using confocal microscopy along with systemic and orthoptic parameters in patients presenting with ocular surface pain using a random forest artificial intelligence (AI) model.\nObservational, cross-sectional.\nTwo hundred forty eyes of 120 patients with primary symptom of ocular surface pain or discomfort and control group of 60 eyes of 31 patients with no symptoms of ocular pain were analysed. A detailed ocular examination included visual acuity, refraction, slit-lamp and fundus. All eyes underwent laser scanning confocal microscopy (Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) and their nerve parameters were evaluated. The presence or absence of orthoptic issues and connective tissue disorders were included in the AI. The eyes were grouped as those (Group 1) with symptom grade higher than signs, (Group 2) with similar grades of symptoms and signs, (Group3) without symptoms but with signs, (Group 4) without symptoms and signs. The area under curve (AUC), accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score were evaluated.\nOver all, the AI achieved an AUC of 0.736, accuracy of 86%, F1-score of 85.9%, precision of 85.6% and recall of 86.3%. The accuracy was the highest for Group 2 and least for Group 3 eyes. The top 6 parameters used for classification by the AI were microneuromas, immature and mature dendritic cells, presence of orthoptic issues and nerve fractal dimension parameter.\nThis study demonstrated that various corneal nerve parameters, presence or absence of systemic and orthoptic issues coupled with AI can be a useful technique to understand and correlate the various clinical and imaging parameters of ocular surface pain.", "Psychologists have studied the ancient concept of wisdom for 3 decades. Nevertheless, apparent discrepancies in theories and empirical findings have left the nomological network of the construct unclear. Using multilevel meta-analyses, we summarized wisdom's correlations with age, intelligence, the Big Five personality traits, narcissism, self-esteem, social desirability, and well-being. We furthermore examined whether these correlations were moderated by the general approach to conceptualizing and measuring wisdom (i.e., phenomenological wisdom as indexed by self-report vs. performative wisdom as indexed by performance ratings), by specific wisdom measures, and by variable-specific factors (e.g., age range, type of intelligence measures, and well-being type). Although phenomenological and performative approaches to conceptualizing and measuring wisdom had some unique correlates, both were correlated with openness, hedonic well-being, and eudaimonic well-being, especially the growth aspect of eudaimonic well-being. Differences between phenomenological and performative wisdom are discussed in terms of the differences between typical and maximal performance, self-ratings and observer ratings, and global and state wisdom. This article will help move the scientific study of wisdom forward by elucidating reliable wisdom correlates and by offering concrete suggestions for future empirical research based on the meta-analytic findings.", "The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of a web-based artificial intelligence program for the detection of interproximal caries in bitewing radiographs. Three hundred bitewing radiographs of patients were subjected to the evaluation of a convolutional neural network. First, the images were visually evaluated by a previously trained and calibrated operator with radiodiagnosis experience. Then, ground truth was established and was clinically validated. For enamel caries, clinical assessment included a combination of clinical-visual and radiography evaluations. For dentin caries, clinical validation was performed by instrumentally accessing the cavity. Second, the images were uploaded and analyzed by the web-based software. Four different models were established to analyze its evaluations according to the confidence threshold (0-100%) offered by the program: model 1 (values >0% were considered positive and values of 0% were considered negative), model 2 (values \u226525% were considered positive and values <25% were considered negative), model 3 (values \u226550% were considered positive and values <50% were considered negative), and model 4 (values \u226575% were considered positive and values <75% were considered negative). The accuracy rate (A), sensitivity (S), specificity (E), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated for the four models of agreement with the software. Models showed the following results respectively: A = 70.8%, 82%, 85.6%, 86.1%; S = 87%, 69.8%, 57%, 41.6%; E = 66.3%, 85.4%, 93.7%, 98.5%; PPV = 42%, 57.2%, 71.6%, 88.6%; NPV = 94.8%, 91%, 88.6%, 85.8%; PLR = 2.58, 4.78, 9.05, 27.73; NLR = 0.2, 0.35, 0.46, 0.59; AUC = 0.767, 0.777, 0.753, 0.701. Findings in the present study suggest that the artificial intelligence web-based software provides a good diagnostic reliability on the detection of dental caries. Our study highlighted model 2 for showing the best results to differentiate between healthy teeth and decayed teeth.", "Endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease have been shown to play an important role in the development and progression of heart failure (HF). Retinal imaging provides a unique opportunity to noninvasively assess vascular structure and function, vessel features, and microcirculation within the retina. Accumulating evidence suggests that retinal vessel caliber, microvascular features, and vascular characteristics extracted from various imaging modalities are associated with alterations in left ventricular structure and function in stage B HF, as well as incident development of symptomatic HF in the general population. Moreover, dynamic retinal vessel analysis has been shown to differentiate HF patients based on their phenotypes. Given the increasing availability of rapid image acquisition devices (eg, nonmydriatic widefield systems and smartphone-based retinal cameras) and the integration of artificial intelligence-based interrogation/assessment techniques, retinal imaging is a promising noninvasive tool, in conjunction with cardiac imaging and biomarkers, to prevent HF and risk stratify those at risk of developing HF. This review focuses on the current evidence on retinal microvasculature changes, and potential clinical relevance and promising utility of retinal imaging in HF.", "The rapid increase of interest in, and use of, artificial intelligence (AI) in computer applications has raised a parallel concern about its ability (or lack thereof) to provide understandable, or explainable, output to users. This concern is especially legitimate in biomedical contexts, where patient safety is of paramount importance. This position paper brings together seven researchers working in the field with different roles and perspectives, to explore in depth the concept of explainable AI, or XAI, offering a functional definition and conceptual framework or model that can be used when considering XAI. This is followed by a series of desiderata for attaining explainability in AI, each of which touches upon a key domain in biomedicine.", "To estimate central 10-degree visual field (VF) map from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) measurements in glaucoma with artificial intelligence.\nArtificial intelligence (convolutional neural networks) study.\nThis study included 5352 SD-OCT scans and 10-2 VF pairs from 1365 eyes of 724 healthy patients, patients with suspected glaucoma, and patients with glaucoma. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed to estimate the 68 individual sensitivity thresholds of 10-2 VF map using all-sectors (CNNA) and temporal-sectors (CNNT) RNFL thickness information of the SD-OCT circle scan (768 thickness points). 10-2 indices including pointwise total deviation (TD) values, mean deviation (MD), and pattern standard deviation (PSD) were generated using the CNN-estimated sensitivity thresholds at individual test locations. Linear regression (LR) models with the same input were used for comparison.\nThe CNNA model achieved an average pointwise mean absolute error of 4.04 dB (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.76-4.35) and correlation coefficient (r) of 0.59 (95% CI 0.52-0.64) over 10-2 map and the mean absolute error and r of 2.88 dB (95% CI 2.63-3.15) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.80) for MD, and 2.31 dB (95% CI 2.03-2.61) and 0.59 (95% CI 0.51-0.65) for PSD estimations, respectively, significantly outperforming the LRA model.\nThe proposed CNNA model improved the estimation of 10-2 VF map based on circumpapillary SD-OCT RNFL thickness measurements. These artificial intelligence methods using SD-OCT structural data show promise to individualize the frequency of central VF assessment in patients with glaucoma and would enable the reallocation of resources from patients at lowest risk to those at highest risk of central VF damage.", "There is growing enthusiasm for the application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to clinical research and practice. However, instructions on how to develop robust high-quality ML and AI in medicine are scarce. In this paper, we provide a practical example of techniques that facilitate the development of high-quality ML systems including data pre-processing, hyperparameter tuning, and model comparison using open-source software and data.\nWe used open-source software and a publicly available dataset to train and validate multiple ML models to classify breast masses into benign or malignant using mammography image features and patient age. We compared algorithm predictions to the ground truth of histopathologic evaluation. We provide step-by-step instructions with accompanying code lines.\nPerformance of the five algorithms at classifying breast masses as benign or malignant based on mammography image features and patient age was statistically equivalent (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) for the logistic regression with elastic net penalty was 0.89 (95% CI 0.85 - 0.94), for the Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree 0.88 (95% CI 0.83 - 0.93), for the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline algorithm 0.88 (95% CI 0.83 - 0.93), for the Support Vector Machine 0.89 (95% CI 0.84 - 0.93), and for the neural network 0.89 (95% CI 0.84 - 0.93).\nOur paper allows clinicians and medical researchers who are interested in using ML algorithms to understand and recreate the elements of a comprehensive ML analysis. Following our instructions may help to improve model generalizability and reproducibility in medical ML studies.", "Recently, Artificial Intelligence namely Deep Learning methods have revolutionized a wide range of domains and applications. Besides, Digital Pathology has so far played a major role in the diagnosis and the prognosis of tumors. However, the characteristics of the Whole Slide Images namely the gigapixel size, high resolution and the shortage of richly labeled samples have hindered the efficiency of classical Machine Learning methods. That goes without saying that traditional methods are poor in generalization to different tasks and data contents. Regarding the success of Deep learning when dealing with Large Scale applications, we have resorted to the use of such models for histopathological image segmentation tasks. First, we review and compare the classical UNet\u00a0and Att-UNet\u00a0models for colon cancer WSI segmentation in a sparsely annotated data scenario. Then, we introduce novel enhanced models of the Att-UNet\u00a0where different schemes are proposed for the skip connections and spatial attention gates positions in the network. In fact, spatial attention gates assist the training process and enable the model to avoid irrelevant feature learning. Alternating the presence of such modules namely in our Alter-AttUNet\u00a0model adds robustness and ensures better image segmentation results. In order to cope with the lack of richly annotated data in our AiCOLO\u00a0colon cancer dataset, we suggest the use of a multi-step training strategy that also deals with the WSI sparse annotations and unbalanced class issues. All proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches but Alter-AttUNet\u00a0generates the best compromise between accurate results and light network. The model achieves 95.88% accuracy with our sparse AiCOLO\u00a0colon cancer datasets. Finally, to evaluate and validate our proposed architectures we resort to publicly available WSI data: the NCT-CRC-HE-100K, the CRC-5000\u00a0and the Warwick\u00a0colon cancer histopathological dataset. Respective accuracies of 99.65%, 99.73% and 79.03% were reached. A comparison with state-of-art approaches is established to view and compare the key solutions for histopathological image segmentation.", "The use of biologic adjuvants (orthobiologics) is becoming commonplace in orthopaedic surgery. Among other applications, biologics are often added to enhance fusion rates in spinal surgery and to promote bone healing in complex fracture patterns. Generally, orthopaedic surgeons use only one biomolecular agent (ie allograft with embedded bone morphogenic protein-2) rather than several agents acting in concert. Bone fusion, however, is a highly multifactorial process and it likely could be more effectively enhanced using biologic factors in combination, acting synergistically. We used artificial neural networks, trained via machine learning on experimental data on orthobiologic interventions and their outcomes, to identify combinations of orthobiologic factors that potentially would be more effective than single agents. This use of machine learning applied to orthobiologic interventions is unprecedented.\nAvailable data on the outcomes associated with various orthopaedic biologic agents, electrical stimulation, and pulsed ultrasound were curated from the literature and assembled into a form suitable for machine learning. The best among many different types of neural networks was chosen for its ability to generalize over this dataset, and that network was used to make predictions concerning the expected efficacy of 2400 medically feasible combinations of 9 different agents and treatments.\nThe most effective combinations were high in the bone-morphogenic proteins (BMP) 2 and 7 (BMP2, 15mg; BMP7, 5mg), and in osteogenin (150ug). In some of the most effective combinations, electrical stimulation could substitute for osteogenin. Some other effective combinations also included bone marrow aspirate concentrate. BMP2 and BMP7 appear to have the strongest pairwise linkage of the factors analyzed in this study.\nArtificial neural networks are powerful forms of artificial intelligence that can be applied readily in the orthopaedic domain, but neural network predictions improve along with the amount of data available to train them. This study provides a starting point from which networks trained on future, expanded datasets can be developed. Yet even this initial model makes specific predictions concerning potentially effective combinatorial therapeutics that should be verified experimentally. Furthermore, our analysis provides an avenue for further research into the basic science of bone healing by demonstrating agents that appear to be linked in function.", "Generalizability, external validity, and reproducibility are high priorities for artificial intelligence applications in healthcare. Traditional approaches to addressing these elements involve sharing patient data between institutions or practice settings, which can compromise data privacy (individuals' right to prevent the sharing and disclosure of information about themselves) and data security (simultaneously preserving confidentiality, accuracy, fidelity, and availability of data). This article describes insights from real-world implementation of federated learning techniques that offer opportunities to maintain both data privacy and availability via collaborative machine learning that shares knowledge, not data. Local models are trained separately on local data. As they train, they send local model updates (e.g. coefficients or gradients) for consolidation into a global model. In some use cases, global models outperform local models on new, previously unseen local datasets, suggesting that collaborative learning from a greater number of examples, including a greater number of rare cases, may improve predictive performance. Even when sharing model updates rather than data, privacy leakage can occur when adversaries perform property or membership inference attacks which can be used to ascertain information about the training set. Emerging techniques mitigate risk from adversarial attacks, allowing investigators to maintain both data privacy and availability in collaborative healthcare research. When data heterogeneity between participating centers is high, personalized algorithms may offer greater generalizability by improving performance on data from centers with proportionately smaller training sample sizes. Properly applied, federated learning has the potential to optimize the reproducibility and performance of collaborative learning while preserving data security and privacy.", "The explosion of interest in exploiting machine learning techniques in healthcare has brought the issue of inferring causation from observational data to centre stage. In our work in supporting the health decisions of the individual person/patient-as-person at the point of care, we cannot avoid making decisions about which options are to be included or excluded in a decision support tool. Should the researcher's routine injunction to use their findings 'with caution', because of methodological limitations, lead to inclusion or exclusion? The task is one of deciding, first on causal plausibility, and then on causality. Like all decisions these are both sensitive to error preferences (trade-offs). We engage selectively with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) literature on the causality challenge and on the closely associated issue of the 'explainability' now demanded of 'black box' AI. Our commitment to embracing 'lifestyle' as well as 'medical' options for the individual person, leads us to highlight the key issue as that of who is to make the preference- sensitive decisions on causal plausibility and causality.", "The way in which research impact is evaluated and assessed has long been under debate. In recent years the focus is moving away from the use of numerical indicators, towards an emphasis on narratives. The Dutch university medical centres (UMCs) have a long-standing tradition of using bibliometric indicators. Because of the declining interest in indicators alone, this study was designed to repurpose bibliometrics to answer specific strategic questions. In this article we discuss the strategic and policy-based questions, the methodology we used in uncovering relevant information and conclusions we draw from the analyses we performed. The aim of this article is to inform a broader audience about the potential applications of bibliometric information to support a new form of research intelligence.\nIn this study we used a curated set of publications from the UMCs. We performed different bibliometric analyses and used bibliometric visualization tools to shed light on research focus, open science practices, collaboration, societal impact and scientific impact.\nThe analyses allowed us to visualize and contextualize the research focus of the UMCs as a whole, but also to show specific focus areas of each UMC. The UMCs are active in the full spectrum of biomedical research, and at the same time are very complementary to each other. Furthermore, we were able to show the development of open access of UMC publications over time, to support the national mission. Visualizing collaboration is a powerful way of showing both the international orientation and the regional and national engine function of UMCs in research. We were able to assess societal impact by looking at the different channels in which publications find their way to societally relevant sources such as news media, policy documents and guidelines. Finally, we assessed scientific impact and put this into an international perspective.\nResearch intelligence is able to transform bibliometric information by interpretation and annotation into highly relevant insights that can be used for several different strategic purposes and for research impact assessment in general.", "Tauopathies are a category of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of abnormal tau protein-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). NFTs are universally observed in aging, occurring with or without the concomitant accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (A\u03b2) in plaques that typifies Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common tauopathy. Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is an A\u03b2-independent process that affects the medial temporal lobe in both cognitively normal and impaired subjects. Determinants of symptomology in subjects with PART are poorly understood and require clinicopathologic correlation; however, classical approaches to staging tau pathology have limited quantitative reproducibility. As such, there is a critical need for unbiased methods to quantitatively analyze tau pathology on the histological level. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generate highly accurate and precise computer vision assessments of digitized pathology slides, yielding novel histology metrics at scale. Here, we performed a retrospective autopsy study of a large cohort (n\u2009=\u2009706) of human post-mortem brain tissues from normal and cognitively impaired elderly individuals with mild or no A\u03b2 plaques (average age of death of 83.1\u00a0yr, range 55-110). We utilized a CNN trained to segment NFTs on hippocampus sections immunohistochemically stained with antisera recognizing abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), which yielded metrics of regional NFT counts, NFT positive pixel density, as well as a novel graph-theory based metric measuring the spatial distribution of NFTs. We found that several AI-derived NFT metrics significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment in both the hippocampus proper and entorhinal cortex (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). When controlling for age, AI-derived NFT counts still significantly predicted the presence of cognitive impairment (p\u2009=\u20090.04 in the entorhinal cortex; p\u2009=\u20090.04 overall). In contrast, Braak stage did not predict cognitive impairment in either age-adjusted or unadjusted models. These findings support the hypothesis that NFT burden correlates with cognitive impairment in PART. Furthermore, our analysis strongly suggests that AI-derived metrics of tau pathology provide a powerful tool that can deepen our understanding of the role of neurofibrillary degeneration in cognitive impairment.", "Early detection of tooth-related diseases in patients plays a key role in maintaining their dental health and preventing future complications. Since dentists are not overly attentive to tooth-related diseases that may be difficult to judge visually, many patients miss timely treatment. The 5 representative tooth-related diseases, that is, coronal caries or defect, proximal caries, cervical caries or abrasion, periapical radiolucency, and residual root can be detected on panoramic images. In this study, a web service was constructed for the detection of these diseases on panoramic images in real time, which helped shorten the treatment planning time and reduce the probability of misdiagnosis.\nThis study designed a model to assess tooth-related diseases in panoramic images by using artificial intelligence in real time. This model can perform an auxiliary role in the diagnosis of tooth-related diseases by dentists and reduce the treatment planning time spent through telemedicine.\nFor learning the 5 tooth-related diseases, 10,000 panoramic images were modeled: 4206 coronal caries or defects, 4478 proximal caries, 6920 cervical caries or abrasion, 8290 periapical radiolucencies, and 1446 residual roots. To learn the model, the fast region-based convolutional network (Fast R-CNN), residual neural network (ResNet), and inception models were used. Learning about the 5 tooth-related diseases completely did not provide accurate information on the diseases because of indistinct features present in the panoramic pictures. Therefore, 1 detection model was applied to each tooth-related disease, and the models for each of the diseases were integrated to increase accuracy.\nThe Fast R-CNN model showed the highest accuracy, with an accuracy of over 90%, in diagnosing the 5 tooth-related diseases. Thus, Fast R-CNN was selected as the final judgment model as it facilitated the real-time diagnosis of dental diseases that are difficult to judge visually from radiographs and images, thereby assisting the dentists in their treatment plans.\nThe Fast R-CNN model showed the highest accuracy in the real-time diagnosis of dental diseases and can therefore play an auxiliary role in shortening the treatment planning time after the dentists diagnose the tooth-related disease. In addition, by updating the captured panoramic images of patients on the web service developed in this study, we are looking forward to increasing the accuracy of diagnosing these 5 tooth-related diseases. The dental diagnosis system in this study takes 2 minutes for diagnosing 5 diseases in 1 panoramic image. Therefore, this system plays an effective role in setting a dental treatment schedule.", "Quantum computing promises to enhance machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, recent theoretical works show that, similar to traditional classifiers based on deep classical neural networks, quantum classifiers would suffer from adversarial perturbations as well. Here we report an experimental demonstration of quantum adversarial learning with programmable superconducting qubits. We train quantum classifiers, which are built on variational quantum circuits consisting of ten transmon qubits featuring average lifetimes of 150\u2009\u03bcs, and average fidelities of simultaneous single- and two-qubit gates above 99.94% and 99.4%, respectively, with both real-life images (for example, medical magnetic resonance imaging scans) and quantum data. We demonstrate that these well-trained classifiers (with testing accuracy up to 99%) can be practically deceived by small adversarial perturbations, whereas an adversarial training process would substantially enhance their robustness to such perturbations.", "To identify change management (CM) strategies for implementing novel artificial intelligence and similar novel technologies in operating rooms and create a new CM model for future trials and applications inspired by the abovementioned strategies and established models.\nKey phases of technology implementation were defined, and strategies for transformational CM were created and applied in a recent CM experience at our institution between October 15, 2020 and October 15, 2021. We appraised existing CM models and propose the newly created model.\nThe key phases of the technology implementation were as follows: (1) team assembly; (2) committee approvals; (3) CM; and (4) system installation and go-live. Key strategies were (1) assemble team with necessary expertise; (2) anticipate potential institutional cultural and regulatory hurdles; (3) add agility to project planning and execution; (4) accommodate institutional culture and regulations; (5) early clinical partner buy-in and stakeholder engagement; and (6) consistent communication, all of which contributed to the new CM model creation.\nKey CM strategies and a new CM model addressing the unique needs and characteristics of operating room novel technology implementation were identified and created. The new model may be customized and tested for individual institution and project's needs and characteristics.", "In this article, existing research investigating how school performance relates to cognitive, self-awareness, language, and personality processes is reviewed. We outline the architecture of the mind, involving a general factor, g, that underlies distinct mental processes (i.e., executive, reasoning, language, cognizance, and personality processes). From preschool to adolescence, g shifts from executive to reasoning and cognizance processes; personality also changes, consolidating in adolescence. There are three major trends in the existing literature: (a) All processes are highly predictive of school achievement if measured alone, each accounting for \u223c20% of its variance; (b) when measured together, cognitive processes (executive functions and representational awareness in preschool and fluid intelligence after late primary school) dominate as predictors (over \u223c50%), drastically absorbing self-concepts and personality dispositions that drop to \u223c3%-5%; and (c) predictive power changes according to the processes forming g at successive levels: attention control and representational awareness in preschool (\u223c85%); fluid intelligence, language, and working memory in primary school (\u223c53%); fluid intelligence, language, self-evaluation, and school-specific self-concepts in secondary school (\u223c70%). Stability and plasticity of personality emerge as predictors in secondary school. A theory of educational priorities is proposed, arguing that (a) executive and awareness processes; (b) information management; and (c) reasoning, self-evaluation, and flexibility in knowledge building must dominate in preschool, primary, and secondary school, respectively.

The capacity to exert self-control has been linked to intelligence in humans, chimpanzees and most recently cuttlefish. Here, we presented 10 Eurasian jays, Garrulus glandarius, with a delayed maintenance task, which measured the ability to choose a preferred outcome as well as the ability to sustain the delay prior to that outcome. Jays were able to wait for better possibilities, but maximum wait times varied across the subjects. We also presented them with five cognitive tasks that assessed spatial memory, spatial relationships and learning capacity. These tasks are commonly used as measures of general intelligence within an ecological context. Individual performance was correlated across the cognitive tasks, which suggests that there was a general intelligence factor underlying their performance. Performance in these tasks was correlated significantly with the jays' capacity to wait for better possibilities. This study demonstrates that self-control and intelligence are correlated in jays. The fact that this correlation exists in diverse species suggests that self-control is a fundamental feature of cognition. Our results are discussed in the context of convergent evolution. This article is part of the theme issue 'Thinking about possibilities: mechanisms, ontogeny, functions and phylogeny'.", "In this work, we argue that the search for Artificial General Intelligence should start from a much lower level than human-level intelligence. The circumstances of intelligent behavior in nature resulted from an organism interacting with its surrounding environment, which could change over time and exert pressure on the organism to allow for learning of new behaviors or environment models. Our hypothesis is that learning occurs through interpreting sensory feedback when an agent acts in an environment. For that to happen, a body and a reactive environment are needed. We evaluate a method to evolve a biologically-inspired artificial neural network that learns from environment reactions named Neuroevolution of Artificial General Intelligence, a framework for low-level artificial general intelligence. This method allows the evolutionary complexification of a randomly-initialized spiking neural network with adaptive synapses, which controls agents instantiated in mutable environments. Such a configuration allows us to benchmark the adaptivity and generality of the controllers. The chosen tasks in the mutable environments are food foraging, emulation of logic gates, and cart-pole balancing. The three tasks are successfully solved with rather small network topologies and therefore it opens up the possibility of experimenting with more complex tasks and scenarios where curriculum learning is beneficial.", "Here we report the design and fabrication of an array-based sensor, containing functionalized Carbon Dots, Bodipy's and Naphthalimide probes, that shows high fluorescence emissions and sensitivity in the presence of low amounts of TNT explosive. In particular, we have fabricated the first sensor device based on an optical array for the detection of TNT in real samples by using a smartphone as detector. The possibility to use a common smartphone as detector leads to a prototype that can be also used in a real-life field application. The key benefit lies in the possibility of even a nonspecialist operator in the field to simply collect and send data (photos) to the trained artificial intelligence server for rapid diagnosis but also directly to the bomb disposal unit for expert evaluation. This new array sensor contains seven different fluorescent probes that are able to interact via noncovalent interactions with TNT. The interaction of each probe with TNT has been tested in solution by fluorescence titrations. The solid device has been tested in terms of selectivity and linearity toward TNT concentration. Tests performed with other explosives and other nitrogen-based analytes demonstrate the high selectivity for TNT molecules, thus supporting the reliability of this sensor. In addition, TNT can be detected in the range of 98 ng\u223c985 \u03bcg, with a clear different response of each probe to the different amounts of TNT.", "The recognition of anatomical variants is essential in preoperative planning for lung cancer surgery. Although three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction provided an intuitive demonstration of the anatomical structure, the recognition process remains fully manual. To render a semiautomated approach for surgery planning, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chest CT semantic segmentation algorithm that recognizes pulmonary vessels on lobular or segmental levels. Hereby, we present a retrospective validation of the algorithm comparing surgeons' performance.\nThe semantic segmentation algorithm to be validated was trained on non-contrast CT scans from a single center. A retrospective pilot study was performed. An independent validation dataset was constituted by an arbitrary selection from patients who underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy in three institutions during Apr. 2020 to Jun. 2021. The golden standard of anatomical variants of each enrolled case was obtained via expert surgeons' judgments based on chest CT, 3-D reconstruction, and surgical observation. The performance of the algorithm is compared against the performance of two junior thoracic surgery attendings based on chest CT.\nA total of 27 cases were included in this study. The overall case-wise accuracy of the AI model was 82.8% in pulmonary vessels compared to 78.8% and 77.0% for the two surgeons, respectively. Segmental artery accuracy was 79.7%, 73.6%, and 72.7%; lobular vein accuracy was 96.3%, 96.3%, and 92.6% by the AI model and two surgeons, respectively. No statistical significance was found. In subgroup analysis, the anatomic structure-wise analysis of the AI algorithm showed a significant difference in accuracies between different lobes (p = 0.012). Higher AI accuracy in the right-upper lobe (RUL) and left-lower lobe (LLL) arteries was shown. A trend of better performance in non-contrast CT was also detected. Most recognition errors by the algorithm were the misclassification of LA1+2 and LA3. Radiological parameters did not exhibit a significant impact on the performance of both AI and surgeons.\nThe semantic segmentation algorithm achieves the recognition of the segmental pulmonary artery and the lobular pulmonary vein. The performance of the model approximates that of junior thoracic surgery attendings. Our work provides a novel semiautomated surgery planning approach that is potentially beneficial to lung cancer patients.", "This study aimed to examine a theory-driven model to explain how language learner's trait emotional intelligence (TEI) and effort as two learner character strengths predict learner enjoyment as a positive emotion and anxiety and boredom as two negative classroom emotions, and how these variables, collectively, predict resilience in language learning. The underlying relationship between these variables was tested via a comprehensive model within a positive psychology perspective using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. The paths in the final structural model indicated that L2 learner TEI did not significantly explain their resilience directly but rather completely indirectly through the mediation of learner negative and positive emotions. Learner effort, directly and indirectly, predicted L2 resilience and its predictive power in it was much larger than that of TEI. In addition, enjoyment and boredom directly influenced L2 resilience and also mediated the relationship between learner character strengths and resilience. Anxiety did not significantly predict learner L2 resilience directly since its influence was rather dependent on the role of enjoyment and boredom in L2 resilience. These findings widely support the claims within positive psychology domain that recognize the vital role of character strengths and learner emotions in enhancing L2 learner resilience.", "We analyze visual processing capabilities of a large-scale model for area V1 that arguably provides the most comprehensive accumulation of anatomical and neurophysiological data to date. We find that this brain-like neural network model can reproduce a number of characteristic visual processing capabilities of the brain, in particular the capability to solve diverse visual processing tasks, also on temporally dispersed visual information, with remarkable robustness to noise. This V1 model, whose architecture and neurons markedly differ from those of deep neural networks used in current artificial intelligence (AI), such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), also reproduces a number of characteristic neural coding properties of the brain, which provides explanations for its superior noise robustness. Because visual processing is substantially more energy efficient in the brain compared with CNNs in AI, such brain-like neural networks are likely to have an impact on future technology: as blueprints for visual processing in more energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.", "The aim of this review was to investigate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in maxillofacial computer-assisted surgical planning (CASP) workflows with the discussion of limitations and possible future directions.\nAn in-depth search of the literature was undertaken to review articles concerned with the application of AI for segmentation, multimodal image registration, virtual surgical planning (VSP), and three-dimensional (3D) printing steps of the maxillofacial CASP workflows.\nThe existing AI models were trained to address individual steps of CASP, and no single intelligent workflow was found encompassing all steps of the planning process. Segmentation of dentomaxillofacial tissue from computed tomography (CT)/cone-beam CT imaging was the most commonly explored area which could be applicable in a clinical setting. Nevertheless, a lack of generalizability was the main issue, as the majority of models were trained with the data derived from a single device and imaging protocol which might not offer similar performance when considering other devices. In relation to registration, VSP and 3D printing, the presence of inadequate heterogeneous data limits the automatization of these tasks.\nThe synergy between AI and CASP workflows has the potential to improve the planning precision and efficacy. However, there is a need for future studies with big data before the emergent technology finds application in a real clinical setting.\nThe implementation of AI models in maxillofacial CASP workflows could minimize a surgeon's workload and increase efficiency and consistency of the planning process, meanwhile enhancing the patient-specific predictability.", "Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE) is a model that decomposes multiple datasets obtained on the same subjects into shared structure, structure unique to each dataset, and noise. JIVE is an important tool for multimodal data integration in neuroimaging. The two most common algorithms are R.JIVE, an iterative approach, and AJIVE, which uses principal angle analysis. The joint structure in JIVE is defined by shared subspaces, but interpreting these subspaces can be challenging. In this paper, we reinterpret AJIVE as a canonical correlation analysis of principal component scores. This reformulation, which we call CJIVE, (1) provides an intuitive view of AJIVE; (2) uses a permutation test for the number of joint components; (3) can be used to predict subject scores for out-of-sample observations; and (4) is computationally fast. We conduct simulation studies that show CJIVE and AJIVE are accurate when the total signal ranks are correctly specified but, generally inaccurate when the total ranks are too large. CJIVE and AJIVE can still extract joint signal even when the joint signal variance is relatively small. JIVE methods are applied to integrate functional connectivity (resting-state fMRI) and structural connectivity (diffusion MRI) from the Human Connectome Project. Surprisingly, the edges with largest loadings in the joint component in functional connectivity do not coincide with the same edges in the structural connectivity, indicating more complex patterns than assumed in spatial priors. Using these loadings, we accurately predict joint subject scores in new participants. We also find joint scores are associated with fluid intelligence, highlighting the potential for JIVE to reveal important shared structure.", "This chapter analyses the various applications of artificial intelligence (AI) developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and examines the range of ethical questions that their multi-level deployment may raise. Within this frame, the author sheds light on the challenges posed by the fast-tracking authorization of some of the AI systems and pays particular attention to the form and shape that \u2018emergency response\u2019 in the field of ethics has taken in order to cope with these extraordinary challenges and the ethical practices that have been developed thus far. The chapter will also provide a detailed set of policy suggestions to overcome these challenges with a special focus on the need to develop an emergency ethics framework that will allow policy-makers to authorize the deployment of AI-powered tools in a responsible and trustworthy manner.", "Severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and young adults has shown to be associated with abnormal brain development, which may contribute to neurocognitive impairments. We aimed to investigate risk factors for neurocognitive impairment and investigate the relation with structural brain abnormalities in young severe CKD patients.\nThis cross-sectional study includes 28 patients with severe CKD (eGFR\u2009<\u200930), aged 8-30\u00a0years (median 18.5\u00a0years), on different treatment modalities (pre-dialysis [n\u2009=\u20098], dialysis [n\u2009=\u20098], transplanted [n\u2009=\u200912]). We assessed neurocognitive functioning using a comprehensive test battery and brain structure by magnetic resonance imaging metrics of brain volume and white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD] measured with diffusion tensor imaging). Multivariate regression and mediation analyses were performed between clinical CKD parameters, brain structure, and neurocognitive outcome.\nA combination of risk factors (e.g., longer time since kidney transplantation, longer dialysis duration and late CKD onset) was significantly associated with lower intelligence and/or worse processing speed and working memory. Lower FA in a cluster of white matter tracts was associated with lower intelligence and mediated the relation between clinical risk factors and lower intelligence.\nYoung severe CKD patients with a prolonged duration of kidney replacement therapy, either dialysis or transplantation are at particular risk for impairments in intelligence, processing speed, and working memory. Disrupted white matter integrity may importantly contribute to these neurocognitive impairments. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in CKD and treatment that affect white matter integrity and neurocognitive outcome in young patients. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information.", "Many artificial intelligence (AI) studies have focused on development of AI models, novel techniques, and reporting guidelines. However, little is understood about clinicians' perspectives of AI applications in medical fields including ophthalmology, particularly in light of recent regulatory guidelines. The aim for this study was to evaluate the perspectives of ophthalmologists regarding AI in 4 major eye conditions: diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract.\nThis was a multi-national survey of ophthalmologists between March 1st, 2020 to February 29th, 2021 disseminated via the major global ophthalmology societies. The survey was designed based on microsystem, mesosystem and macrosystem questions, and the software as a medical device (SaMD) regulatory framework chaired by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Factors associated with AI adoption for ophthalmology analyzed with multivariable logistic regression random forest machine learning.\nOne thousand one hundred seventy-six ophthalmologists from 70 countries participated with a response rate ranging from 78.8 to 85.8% per question. Ophthalmologists were more willing to use AI as clinical assistive tools (88.1%, n = 890/1,010) especially those with over 20 years' experience (OR 3.70, 95% CI: 1.10-12.5, p = 0.035), as compared to clinical decision support tools (78.8%, n = 796/1,010) or diagnostic tools (64.5%, n = 651). A majority of Ophthalmologists felt that AI is most relevant to DR (78.2%), followed by glaucoma (70.7%), AMD (66.8%), and cataract (51.4%) detection. Many participants were confident their roles will not be replaced (68.2%, n = 632/927), and felt COVID-19 catalyzed willingness to adopt AI (80.9%, n = 750/927). Common barriers to implementation include medical liability from errors (72.5%, n = 672/927) whereas enablers include improving access (94.5%, n = 876/927). Machine learning modeling predicted acceptance from participant demographics with moderate to high accuracy, and area under the receiver operating curves of 0.63-0.83.\nOphthalmologists are receptive to adopting AI as assistive tools for DR, glaucoma, and AMD. Furthermore, ML is a useful method that can be applied to evaluate predictive factors on clinical qualitative questionnaires. This study outlines actionable insights for future research and facilitation interventions to drive adoption and operationalization of AI tools for Ophthalmology.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have revolutionized and redefined the landscape of data analysis in business, healthcare, and technology. These methods have innovated the applied mathematics, computer science, and engineering fields and are showing considerable potential for risk science, especially in the disaster risk domain. The disaster risk field has yet to define itself as a necessary application domain for AI implementation by defining how to responsibly balance AI and disaster risk. (1) How is AI being used for disaster risk applications; and how are these applications addressing the principles and assumptions of risk science, (2) What are the benefits of AI being used for risk applications; and what are the benefits of applying risk principles and assumptions for AI-based applications, (3) What are the synergies between AI and risk science applications, and (4) What are the characteristics of effective use of fundamental risk principles and assumptions for AI-based applications? This study develops and disseminates an online survey questionnaire that leverages expertise from risk and AI professionals to identify the most important characteristics related to AI and risk, then presents a framework for gauging how AI and disaster risk can be balanced. This study is the first to develop a classification system for applying risk principles for AI-based applications. This classification contributes to understanding of AI and risk by exploring how AI can be used to manage risk, how AI methods introduce new or additional risk, and whether fundamental risk principles and assumptions are sufficient for AI-based applications.", "Holistic health care (HHC) is a synonym for complete patient care, and as such an efficient clinical decision support system (CDSS) for HHC is critical to support the judgement of physician's decision in response of patient's physical, emotional, social, economic, and spiritual needs. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved considerably in the past decades and many AI applications have been deployed in various contexts. Therefore, this study aims to propose an AI-assisted CDSS model that predicts patients in need of HHC and applies an improved recurrent neural network (RNN) model, long short-term memory (LSTM) for the prediction. The data sources include in-patient's comorbidity status and daily vital sign attributes such as blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen prescription, etc. A two-year dataset consisting of 121 thousand anonymized patient cases with 890 thousand physiological medical records was obtained from a medical center in Taiwan for system evaluation. Comparing with the rule-based expert system, the proposed AI-assisted CDSS improves sensitivity from 26.44% to 80.84% and specificity from 99.23% to 99.95%. The experimental results demonstrate that an AI-assisted CDSS could efficiently predict HHC patients.", "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly seen liver disease. Most of HCC patients are diagnosed as Hepatitis B related cirrhosis simultaneously, especially in Asian countries. HCC is the fifth most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the World. HCC incidence rates have been rising in the past 3 decades, and it is expected to be doubled by 2030, if there is no effective means for its early diagnosis and management. The improvement of patient's care, research, and policy is significantly based on accurate medical diagnosis, especially for malignant tumor patients. However, sometimes it is really difficult to get access to advanced and expensive diagnostic tools such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET-CT)., especially for people who resides in poverty-stricken area. Therefore, experts are searching for a framework for predicting of early liver diseases based on basic and simple examinations such as biochemical and routine blood tests, which are easily accessible all around the World. Disease identification and classification has been significantly enhanced by using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in conjunction with clinical data. The goal of this research is to extract the most significant risk factors or clinical parameters for liver diseases in 525 patients based on clinical experience using machine learning algorithms, such as regularized regression (RR), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results showed that RF classier had the best performance (accuracy = 0.762, recall = 0.843, F1-score = 0.775, and AUC = 0.999) among the five ML algorithms. And the important orders of 14 significant risk factors are as follows: Total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), direct bilirubin, hemoglobin, age, platelet, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholesterol, albumin, urea nitrogen, and white blood cells. ML classifiers might aid medical organizations in the early detection and classification of liver disease, which would be beneficial in low-income regions, and the relevance of risk factors would be helpful in the prevention and treatment of liver disease patients.", "According to the US Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, health care systems have been experiencing blood transfusion overuse. To minimize the overuse of blood product transfusions, a proprietary artificial intelligence (AI)-based blood utilization calculator (BUC) was developed and integrated into a US hospital's electronic health record. Despite the promising performance of the BUC, this technology remains underused in the clinical setting.\nThis study aims to explore how clinicians perceived this AI-based decision support system and, consequently, understand the factors hindering BUC use.\nWe interviewed 10 clinicians (BUC users) until the data saturation point was reached. The interviews were conducted over a web-based platform and were recorded. The audiovisual recordings were then anonymously transcribed verbatim. We used an inductive-deductive thematic analysis to analyze the transcripts, which involved applying predetermined themes to the data (deductive) and consecutively identifying new themes as they emerged in the data (inductive).\nWe identified the following two themes: (1) workload and usability and (2) clinical decision-making. Clinicians acknowledged the ease of use and usefulness of the BUC for the general inpatient population. The clinicians also found the BUC to be useful in making decisions related to blood transfusion. However, some clinicians found the technology to be confusing due to inconsistent automation across different blood work processes.\nThis study highlights that analytical efficacy alone does not ensure technology use or acceptance. The overall system's design, user perception, and users' knowledge of the technology are equally important and necessary (limitations, functionality, purpose, and scope). Therefore, the effective integration of AI-based decision support systems, such as the BUC, mandates multidisciplinary engagement, ensuring the adequate initial and recurrent training of AI users while maintaining high analytical efficacy and validity. As a final takeaway, the design of AI systems that are made to perform specific tasks must be self-explanatory, so that the users can easily understand how and when to use the technology. Using any technology on a population for whom it was not initially designed will hinder user perception and the technology's use.", "Findings from St Jude Total Therapy Study 16 (Total 16) showed early intensification of triple intrathecal therapy (ITT) improved CNS disease control for children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at the greatest risk of CNS relapse. We examined the impact of this treatment on end-of-therapy neurocognitive outcomes.\nBetween 2007 and 2017, 400 (83.5%) of 479 eligible patients treated with Total 16 risk-directed chemotherapy completed protocol-directed neurocognitive testing at the end of therapy. Intensified ITT was defined as \u2265 21 cumulative doses for patients with low-risk ALL (n = 70/194) and \u2265 27 doses for those with standard-to-high risk ALL (n = 81/206).\nCompared with age-normative expectations, the overall group had significantly lower estimated intelligence quotient (P < .0001), attention (P = .0051), working memory (P = .0001), processing speed (P = .0002), fine motor speed (P = .0001), and math (P = .0087). Caregiver ratings of patient functioning showed elevated risk for problems in attention (P = .0173), executive function (P = .0001), and adaptive skills (P = .0001). Among the low-risk treatment group, there were no significant differences between patients treated with or without intensified ITT (all P's >.10). Among patients with standard-to-high risk ALL, those treated with intensified ITT had poorer working memory (P = .0328) and fine motor speed (P = .0403), and elevated ratings of inattention (P = .0189) and executive dysfunction (P = .0245). In the standard-to-high risk group, females treated with intensified ITT had lower working memory scores. Public insurance status was associated with worse neurocognitive outcomes in both treatment groups.\nStandard-to-high risk patients treated with intensified ITT are at moderately increased risk for neurocognitive problems. The findings suggest a threshold effect for ITT exposure, which can inform the design of future clinical trials and approaches to neurocognitive monitoring and intervention.", "Nowadays Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental component of healthcare applications, both clinical and remote, but the best performing AI systems are often too complex to be self-explaining. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are defined to unveil the reasoning behind the system's predictions and decisions, and they become even more critical when dealing with sensitive and personal health data. It is worth noting that XAI has not gathered the same attention across different research areas and data types, especially in healthcare. In particular, many clinical and remote health applications are based on tabular and time series data, respectively, and XAI is not commonly analysed on these data types, while computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are the reference applications. To provide an overview of XAI methods that are most suitable for tabular and time series data in the healthcare domain, this paper provides a review of the literature in the last 5 years, illustrating the type of generated explanations and the efforts provided to evaluate their relevance and quality. Specifically, we identify clinical validation, consistency assessment, objective and standardised quality evaluation, and human-centered quality assessment as key features to ensure effective explanations for the end users. Finally, we highlight the main research challenges in the field as well as the limitations of existing XAI methods.", "Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have resulted in recent breakthroughs in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) across many different domains. An emerging landscape of development environments is making powerful RL techniques more accessible for a growing community of researchers. However, most existing frameworks do not directly address the problem of learning in complex operating environments, such as dense urban settings or defense-related scenarios, that incorporate distributed, heterogeneous teams of agents. To help enable AI research for this important class of applications, we introduce the AI Arena: a scalable framework with flexible abstractions for associating agents with policies and policies with learning algorithms. Our results highlight the strengths of our approach, illustrate the importance of curriculum design, and measure the impact of multi-agent learning paradigms on the emergence of cooperation.", "To implement an all-day online artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted detection of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by prehospital 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) to facilitate patient triage for timely reperfusion therapy.\nThe proposed AI model combines a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) to predict STEMI on prehospital 12-lead ECGs obtained from mini-12-lead ECG devices equipped in ambulance vehicles in Central Taiwan. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) from the 14 AI-implemented fire stations performed the on-site 12-lead ECG examinations using the mini portable device. The 12-lead ECG signals were transmitted to the AI center of China Medical University Hospital to classify the recordings as \"STEMI\" or \"Not STEMI\". In 11 non-AI fire stations, the ECG data were transmitted to a secure network and read by available on-line emergency physicians. The response time was defined as the time interval between the ECG transmission and ECG interpretation feedback.\nBetween July 17, 2021, and March 26, 2022, the AI model classified 362 prehospital 12-lead ECGs obtained from 275 consecutive patients who had called the 119 dispatch centers of fire stations in Central Taiwan for symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath. The AI's response time to the EMTs in ambulance vehicles was 37.2 \u00b1 11.3 s, which was shorter than the online physicians' response time from 11 other fire stations with no AI implementation (113.2 \u00b1 369.4 s, P < 0.001) after analyzing another set of 335 prehospital 12-lead ECGs. The evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and F1 score to assess the overall AI performance in the remote detection of STEMI were 0.992, 0.889, 0.994, 0.941, 0.997, and 0.914, respectively. During the study period, the AI model promptly identified 10 STEMI patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) with a median contact-to-door time of 18.5 (IQR: 16-20.8) minutes.\nImplementation of an all-day real-time AI-assisted remote detection of STEMI on prehospital 12-lead ECGs in the field is feasible with a high diagnostic accuracy rate. This approach may help minimize preventable delays in contact-to-treatment times for STEMI patients who require PPCI.", "In this study, the characteristics of the Covid-19 pandemic in Turkey are examined in terms of the number of cases and deaths, and a characteristic prediction is made with an approach that employs artificial intelligence. The number of cases and deaths are estimated using the number of tests, the numbers of seriously ill and recovered patients as parameters. The machine learning methods used are linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression with different kernel functions, decision tree and artificial neural networks. The obtained results are compared by calculating the coefficient of determination (R 2), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values. When R 2 and MAPE values are compared, it is seen that the optimal results for cases in Turkey are obtained with the decision tree, for deaths with polynomial regression method. The results reached for the United States of America and Russia are similar and the optimal results are obtained by polynomial regression. However, while the optimal results are obtained by neural networks in the Indian data, linear regression for the cases in the Brazilian data, neural network for the deaths, decision tree for the cases in France, polynomial regression for the deaths, neural network for the cases in the UK data and decision tree for the deaths are the methods that produced the optimal results. These results also give an idea about the similarities and differences of country characteristics.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often accompanied by intellectual disability (ID). Despite extensive studies, however, the genetic basis for this comorbidity is still not clear. In this study, we tried to develop an analyzing pipeline for de novo mutations and possible pathways related to ID phenotype in ASD. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to screen de novo mutations and candidate genes in 79 ASD children together with their parents (trios). The de novo altering genes and relative pathways which were associated with ID phenotype were analyzed. The connection nodes (genes) of above pathways were selected, and the diagnostic value of these selected genes for ID phenotype in the study population was also evaluated.\nWe identified 89 de novo mutant genes, of which 34 genes were previously reported to be associated with ASD, including double hits in the EGF repeats of NOTCH1 gene (p.V999M and p.S1027L). Interestingly, of these 34 genes, 22 may directly affect intelligence quotient (IQ). Further analyses revealed that these IQ-related genes were enriched in protein synthesis, energy metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, and at least 9 genes (CACNA1A, ALG9, PALM2, MGAT4A, PCK2, PLEKHA1, PSME3, ADI1, and TLE3) were involved in all these three pathways. Seven patients who harbored these gene mutations showed a high prevalence of a low IQ score (&lt;\u200970), a non-verbal language, and an early diagnostic age (&lt;\u20094\u00a0years). Furthermore, our panel of these 9 genes reached a 10.2% diagnostic rate (5/49) in early diagnostic patients with a low IQ score and also reached a 10% diagnostic yield in those with both a low IQ score and non-verbal language (4/40).\nWe found some new genetic disposition for ASD accompanied with intellectual disability in this study. Our results may be helpful for etiologic research and early diagnoses of intellectual disability in ASD. Larger population studies and further mechanism studies are warranted.", "Before and after the fandom, the pattern of education has difficulty in accepting the requirements of the MZ generation with very intense changes. Individual differences between students and different educational environments have more difficulties with the addition of practical subjects than general students. In this study of the purpose, after coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), the change in demand was described for the factors that influence the motivation necessary in current beauty education for diversity in education methods of MZ generation.\nThese thesis studies are literature reviews, and for this purpose, a narrative review approach was used. A total of 200-300 references were selected and reviewed, and a total of papers were finally selected as of 2010-2022 using the\u00a0PRISMA flow diagram.\nWith the emergence of diversity in education, online education is showing its power. In beauty education, the need for education of practical subjects has emerged and is the basis for providing more skilled skills in the field. This review paper conducted a comprehensive study on the motivational factors that will be the basis for the improved academic achievement of the MZ generation on the changes in education after COVID-19.\nThis literature review revealed the needs of the subjects of K-education to be seen after the post-COVID era and the factors of learning motivation required in the beauty distance education of the MZ generation. In addition, the global status of K-beauty workers has confirmed that new changes with beauty and intelligence are being born as well as simple technical, and it is expected to be used as an important material for beauty distance education.", "Data-driven discovery of image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) from large-scale multimodal brain imaging data has enormous potential for neuroscientific and clinical research by linking IDPs to subjects' demographic, behavioural, clinical and cognitive measures (i.e., non-imaging derived phenotypes or nIDPs). However, current approaches are primarily based on unsupervised approaches, without the use of information in nIDPs. In this paper, we proposed a semi-supervised, multimodal, and multi-task fusion approach, termed SuperBigFLICA, for IDP discovery, which simultaneously integrates information from multiple imaging modalities as well as multiple nIDPs. SuperBigFLICA is computationally efficient and largely avoids the need for parameter tuning. Using the UK Biobank brain imaging dataset with around 40,000 subjects and 47 modalities, along with more than 17,000 nIDPs, we showed that SuperBigFLICA enhances the prediction power of nIDPs, benchmarked against IDPs derived by conventional expert-knowledge and unsupervised-learning approaches (with average nIDP prediction accuracy improvements of up to 46%). It also enables the learning of generic imaging features that can predict new nIDPs. Further empirical analysis of the SuperBigFLICA algorithm demonstrates its robustness in different prediction tasks and the ability to derive biologically meaningful IDPs in predicting health outcomes and cognitive nIDPs, such as fluid intelligence and hypertension.", "Recent developments in artificial intelligence technologies have come to a point where machine learning algorithms can infer mental status based on someone's photos and texts posted on social media. More than that, these algorithms are able to predict, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, future mental illness. They potentially represent an important advance in mental health care for preventive and early diagnosis initiatives, and for aiding professionals in the follow-up and prognosis of their patients. However, important issues call for major caution in the use of such technologies, namely, privacy and the stigma related to mental disorders. In this paper, we discuss the bioethical implications of using such technologies to diagnose and predict future mental illness, given the current scenario of swiftly growing technologies that analyze human language and the online availability of personal information given by social media. We also suggest future directions to be taken to minimize the misuse of such important technologies.", "Personalised medicine (PM) presents a great opportunity to improve the future of individualised healthcare. Recent advances in -omics technologies have led to unprecedented efforts characterising the biology and molecular mechanisms that underlie the development and progression of a wide array of complex human diseases, supporting further development of PM. This article reflects the outcome of the 2021 EATRIS-Plus Multi-omics Stakeholder Group workshop organised to 1) outline a global overview of common promises and challenges that key European stakeholders are facing in the field of multi-omics research, 2) assess the potential of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), and 3) establish an initial dialogue between key initiatives in this space. Our focus is on the alignment of agendas of European initiatives in multi-omics research and the centrality of patients in designing solutions that have the potential to advance PM in long-term healthcare strategies.", "The widespread application of artificial intelligence in health research is currently hampered by limitations in data availability. Distributed learning methods such as federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are introduced to solve this problem as well as data management and ownership issues with their different strengths and weaknesses. The recent proposal of federated split task-agnostic (F eSTA) learning tries to reconcile the distinct merits of FL and SL by enabling the multi-task collaboration between participants through Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, but they suffer from higher communication overhead. To address this, here we present a multi-task distributed learning using ViT with random patch permutation, dubbed p -F eSTA. Instead of using a CNN-based head as in F eSTA, p -F eSTA adopts a simple patch embedder with random permutation, improving the multi-task learning performance without sacrificing privacy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method significantly enhances the benefit of multi-task collaboration, communication efficiency, and privacy preservation, shedding light on practical multi-task distributed learning in the field of medical imaging.", "People differ in intelligence, cognitive ability, personality traits, motivation, and similar valued and, to a large degree, inherited characteristics that determine success and achievements. When does individual heterogeneity lead to a fair distribution of rewards and outcomes? Here, we develop this question theoretically and then test it experimentally for a set of structural conditions in a specific interaction situation. We first catalogue the functional relationship between individual endowments and outcomes to distinguish between fairness concepts such as meritocracy, equality of opportunity, equality of outcomes, and Rawl's theory of justice. We then use an online experiment to study which of these fairness patterns emerge when differently endowed individuals can share their resources with others, depending on whether information about others' endowments and outcomes is available. We find that while visible outcomes lessen inequality by decreasing the statistical dispersion of outcomes across the group, endowments need to be visible for better equality of opportunity for the most disadvantaged.", "Diabetes is a deadly chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is not able to produce ample insulin or when the body cannot use insulin effectively. If undetected, it may lead to a host of health complications. Hence, accurate and explainable early-stage detection of diabetes is essential for the proper administration of treatment options in leading a healthy and productive life. For this, we developed an interpretable TabNet model tuned via Bayesian optimization (BO). To achieve model-specific interpretability, the attention mechanism of TabNet architecture was used, which offered the local and global model explanations on the influence of the attributes on the outcomes. The model was further explained locally and globally using more robust model-agnostic LIME and SHAP eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools. The proposed model outperformed all benchmarked models by obtaining high accuracy of 92.2% and 99.4% using the Pima Indians diabetes dataset (PIDD) and the early-stage diabetes risk prediction dataset (ESDRPD), respectively. Based on the XAI results, it was clear that the most influential attribute for diabetes classification using PIDD and ESDRPD were Insulin and Polyuria, respectively. The feature importance values registered for insulin was 0.301 (PIDD) and for polyuria 0.206 was registered (ESDRPD). The high accuracy and ancillary interpretability of our objective model is expected to increase end-users trust and confidence in early-stage detection of diabetes.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen as one of the major disrupting forces in the future healthcare system. However, the assessment of the value of these new technologies is still unclear, and no agreed international health technology assessment-based guideline exists. This study provides an overview of the available literature in the value assessment of AI in the field of medical imaging.\nWe performed a systematic scoping review of published studies between January 2016 and September 2020 using 10 databases (Medline, Scopus, ProQuest, Google Scholar, and six related databases of grey literature). Information about the context (country, clinical area, and type of study) and mentioned domains with specific outcomes and items were extracted. An existing domain classification, from a European assessment framework, was used as a point of departure, and extracted data were grouped into domains and content analysis of data was performed covering predetermined themes.\nSeventy-nine studies were included out of 5890 identified articles. An additional seven studies were identified by searching reference lists, and the analysis was performed on 86 included studies. Eleven domains were identified: (1) health problem and current use of technology, (2) technology aspects, (3) safety assessment, (4) clinical effectiveness, (5) economics, (6) ethical analysis, (7) organisational aspects, (8) patients and social aspects, (9) legal aspects, (10) development of AI algorithm, performance metrics and validation, and (11) other aspects. The frequency of mentioning a domain varied from 20 to 78% within the included papers. Only 15/86 studies were actual assessments of AI technologies. The majority of data were statements from reviews or papers voicing future needs or challenges of AI research, i.e. not actual outcomes of evaluations.\nThis review regarding value assessment of AI in medical imaging yielded 86 studies including 11 identified domains. The domain classification based on European assessment framework proved useful and current analysis added one new domain. Included studies had a broad range of essential domains about addressing AI technologies highlighting the importance of domains related to legal and ethical aspects.", "Maximum Probability Framework, powered by Maximum Probability Theorem, is a recent theoretical development in artificial intelligence, aiming to formally define probabilistic models, guiding development of objective functions, and regularization of probabilistic models. MPT uses the probability distribution that the models assume on random variables to provide an upper bound on the probability of the model. We apply MPT to challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problems in computer vision by incorporating MPT as a regularization scheme in the training of CNNs and their energy-based variants. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on 1080 trained models, with varying hyperparameters, and conclude that the MPT-based regularization strategy stabilizes and improves the generalization and robustness of base models in addition to enhanced OOD performance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and MNIST datasets.", "Static and dynamic bone histomorphometry and identification of bone cells in culture are labor-intensive and highly repetitive tasks. Several computer-assisted methods have been proposed to ease these tasks and to take advantage of the increased computational power available today. The present review aimed to provide an overview of contemporary methods utilizing specialized computer software to perform bone histomorphometry or identification of bone cells in culture. In addition, a brief historical perspective on bone histomorphometry is included. We identified ten publications using five different computer-assisted approaches (1) ImageJ and BoneJ; (2) Histomorph: OsteoidHisto, CalceinHisto, and TrapHisto; (3) Fiji/ImageJ2 and Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS); (4) Visiopharm and artificial intelligence (AI); and (5) Osteoclast identification using deep learning with Single Shot Detection (SSD) architecture, Darknet and You Only Look Once (YOLO), or watershed algorithm (OC_Finder). The review also highlighted a substantial need for more validation studies that evaluate the accuracy of the new computational methods to the manual and conventional analyses of histological bone specimens and cells in culture using microscopy. However, a substantial evolution has occurred during the last decade to identify and separate bone cells and structures of interest. Most early studies have used simple image segmentation to separate structures of interest, whereas the most recent studies have utilized AI and deep learning. AI has been proposed to substantially decrease the amount of time needed for analyses and enable unbiased assessments. Despite the clear advantages of highly sophisticated computational methods, the limited nature of existing validation studies, particularly those that assess the accuracy of the third-generation methods compared to the second-generation methods, appears to be an important reason that these techniques have failed to gain wide acceptance.", "Approximately 44% of U.S. workers are low-wage workers. Recent years have witnessed a raging debate about whether to raise their minimum wages. Why do some decision-makers support raising wages and others do not? Ten studies (four preregistered) examined people's beliefs about the malleability of intelligence as a key antecedent. The more U.S. human resource managers (Study 1) and Indian business owners (Study 2) believed that people's intelligence can grow (i.e., had a growth mindset), the more they supported increasing low-wage workers' compensation. In key U.S. swing states (Study 3a), and a nationally representative sample (Study 3b), residents with a more growth mindset were more willing to support ballot propositions increasing the minimum wage and other compensation. Study 4 provided causal evidence. The next two studies confirmed the specificity of the predictor. People's beliefs about the malleability of intelligence, but not personality (Study 5a) or effort (Study 5b), predicted their support for increasing low-wage workers' compensation. Study 6 examined multiple potential mechanisms, including empathy, attributions for poverty, and environmental affordances. The relationship between growth mindset and support for raising low-wage workers' wages was explained by more situational rather than dispositional attributions for poverty. Finally, Studies 7a and 7b replicated the effect of growth mindset on support for increasing low-wage workers' compensation and provided confirmatory evidence for the mediator-situational, rather than dispositional, attributions of poverty. These findings suggest that growth mindsets about intelligence promote support for increasing low-wage workers' wages; we discuss the theoretical and practical implications.

The following models were trained: logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbours, decision tree, random forest, artificial neural network, gradient boosting, and naive Bayes. In addition, different models were aggregated by means of the ensembled stacking method. The primary outcome of the study was related to the prediction of overall molar loss (MLO) in patients after active periodontal treatment.\nThe general performance in the external validation settings (aggregating three cohorts) revealed that the ensembled model, which combined neural network and logistic regression, showed the best performance among the different models for the prediction of MLO with an area under the curve (AUC)\u00a0=\u00a00.726. The neural network model showed the best AUC of 0.724 for the prediction of periodontitis-related molar loss. In addition, the ensembled model showed the best calibration performance.\nThrough a multi-centre collaboration, both prognostic models for the prediction of molar loss were developed and externally validated. The ensembled model showed the best performance in terms of both discrimination and validation, and it is made freely available to clinicians for widespread use in clinical practice.", "Since U.S. President Barack Obama announced the Precision Medicine Initiative in his New Year's State of the Union address in 2015, the establishment of a precision medicine system has been emphasized worldwide, particularly in the field of oncology. With the advent of next-generation sequencers specifically, genome analysis technology has made remarkable progress, and there are active efforts to apply genome information to diagnosis and treatment. Generally, in the process of feeding back the results of next-generation sequencing analysis to patients, a molecular tumor board (MTB), consisting of experts in clinical oncology, genetic medicine, etc., is established to discuss the results. On the other hand, an MTB currently involves a large amount of work, with humans searching through vast databases and literature, selecting the best drug candidates, and manually confirming the status of available clinical trials. In addition, as personalized medicine advances, the burden on MTB members is expected to increase in the future. Under these circumstances, introducing cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technology and information and communication technology to MTBs while reducing the burden on MTB members and building a platform that enables more accurate and personalized medical care would be of great benefit to patients. In this review, we introduced the latest status of elemental technologies that have potential for AI utilization in MTB, and discussed issues that may arise in the future as we progress with AI implementation.", "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) models with magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) in predicting pathological complete response(pCR) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in patients with rectal cancer. Furthermore, assessed the methodological quality of the models.\nWe searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science for studies published before 21 June 2022, without any language restrictions. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) tools were used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. We calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity using random-effects models, I2 values were used to measure heterogeneity, and subgroup analyses to explore potential sources of heterogeneity.\nWe selected 21 papers for inclusion in the meta-analysis from 1562 retrieved publications, with a total of 1873 people in the validation groups. The meta-analysis showed that AI models based on MRI predicted pCR to nCRT in patients with rectal cancer: a pooled area under the curve (AUC) 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88-0.93), sensitivity of 0.82(95% CI,0.71-0.90), pooled specificity 0.86(95% CI,0.80-0.91). In the subgroup analysis, the pooled AUC of the deep learning(DL) model was 0.97, the pooled AUC of the radiomics model was 0.85; the pooled AUC of the combined model with clinical factors was 0.92, and the pooled AUC of the radiomics model alone was 0.87. The mean RQS score of the included studies was 10.95, accounting for 30.4% of the total score.\nRadiomics is a promising noninvasive method with high value in predicting pathological response to nCRT in patients with rectal cancer. DL models have higher predictive accuracy than radiomics models, and combined models incorporating clinical factors have higher diagnostic accuracy than radiomics models alone. In the future, prospective, large-scale, multicenter investigations using radiomics approaches will strengthen the diagnostic power of pCR.\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42021285630.", "Osteoporosis (OP) is characterized by diminished bone mass and deteriorating bone structure that increases the chance of fractures in the spine, hips, and wrists. In this paper, a novel data processing method of artificial intelligence (AI) is used for evaluating, predicting, and classifying OP risk factors in clinical data of men and women separately. Additionally, artificial intelligence was used to suggest the most appropriate sports programs for treatment. Data was obtained from dual-energy x-ray absorption scanning center of Ayatollah Kashani, Milad, and Khatam al-Anbia hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The subjects included 1224 men and women. Models were developed using decision tree, random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, gradient boosting (GB), Extra trees, Ada Boost (AB), and artificial neural network multilayer perceptron analysis to predict osteoporosis and to recommend sports programs. Data was divided into training (80%) and test dataset (20%). The results were obtained on a 20% test dataset. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to compare the performance of the models. To predict healthy individuals, osteopenia and osteoporosis, the FR algorithm with AUROC 0.91 performed best in men and the GB algorithm with AUROC 0.95 performed best in women compared to other classification algorithms. Prediction of RF algorithm in women and men with AUROC 0.96 and 0.99, respectively, showed the highest performance in diagnosing the type of exercise for healthy individuals and those with osteopenia and OP. Eight AI algorithms were developed and compared to accurately predict osteoporosis risk factors and classify individuals into three categories: healthy, osteopenia, and OP. In addition, the AI algorithms were developed to recommend the most appropriate sports programs as part of treatment. Applying the AI algorithms in a clinical setting could help primary care providers classify patients with osteoporosis and improve treatment by recommending appropriate exercise programs.", "This systematic review focuses on using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect COVID-19 infection with the help of X-ray images. Methodology: In January 2022, the authors searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus using specific medical subject headings terms and filters. All articles were independently reviewed by two reviewers. All conflicts resulting from a misunderstanding were resolved by a third independent researcher. After assessing abstracts and article usefulness, eliminating repetitions and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, six studies were found to be qualified for this study. Results: The findings from individual studies differed due to the various approaches of the authors. Sensitivity was 72.59%-100%, specificity was 79%-99.9%, precision was 74.74%-98.7%, accuracy was 76.18%-99.81%, and the area under the curve was 95.24%-97.7%. Conclusion: AI computational models used to assess chest X-rays in the process of diagnosing COVID-19 should achieve sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity. Their results and performance should be repeatable to make them dependable for clinicians. Moreover, these additional diagnostic tools should be more affordable and faster than the currently available procedures. The performance and calculations of AI-based systems should take clinical data into account.", "Although breast cancer screening can benefit from Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is still unknown whether, to which extent or under which conditions, the use of AI is going to be accepted by the general population. The aim of our study is to evaluate what the females who are eligible for breast cancer screening know about AI and how they perceive such innovation.\nWe used a prospective survey consisting of a 11-multiple-choice questionnaire evaluating statistical associations with Chi-Square-test or Fisher-exact-test. Multinomial-logistic-regression was performed on items with more than two response categories. Odds ratio (OR) with 95%\u2009CI were computed to estimate the probability of a specific response according to patient's characteristics.\nIn the 800 analysed questionnaires, 51% of respondents confirmed to have knowledge of AI. Of these, 88% expressed a positive opinion about its use in medicine. Non-Italian respondents were associated with the belief of having a deep awareness about AI more often than Italian respondents (OR = 1.91;95%\u2009CI[1.10-3.33]). Higher education level was associated with better opinions on the use of AI in medicine (OR = 4.69;95%\u2009CI[1.36-16.12]). According to 94% of respondents, the radiologists should always produce their own report on mammograms, whilst 77% agreed that AI should be used as a second reader. Most respondents (52%) considered that both the software developer and the radiologist should be held accountable for AI errors.\nMost of the females undergoing screening in our Institute approve the introduction of AI, although only as a support to radiologist, and not in substitution thereof. Yet, accountability in case of AI errors is still unsolved. advances in knowledge:This survey may be considered as a pilot-study for the development of large-scale studies to understand females's demands and concerns about AI applications in breast cancer screening.", "Colon Capsule Endoscopy (CCE) is a minimally invasive procedure which is increasingly being used as an alternative to conventional colonoscopy. Videos recorded by the capsule cameras are long and require one or more experts' time to review and identify polyps or other potential intestinal problems that can lead to major health issues. We developed and tested a multi-platform web application, AI-Tool, which embeds a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to help CCE reviewers. With the help of artificial intelligence, AI-Tool is able to detect images with high probability of containing a polyp and prioritize them during the reviewing process. With the collaboration of 3 experts that reviewed 18 videos, we compared the classical linear review method using RAPID Reader Software v9.0 and the new software we present. Applying the new strategy, reviewing time was reduced by a factor of 6 and polyp detection sensitivity was increased from 81.08 to 87.80%.", "To generate and evaluate post-therapeutic optical coherence tomography (OCT) images based on pre-therapeutic images with generative adversarial network (GAN) to predict the short-term response of patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. Real-world imaging data were retrospectively collected from 1 May 2017, to 1 June 2021. A total of 515 pairs of pre-and post-therapeutic OCT images of patients with RVO were included in the training set, while 68 pre-and post-therapeutic OCT images were included in the validation set. A pix2pixHD method was adopted to predict post-therapeutic OCT images in RVO patients after anti-VEGF therapy. The quality and similarity of synthetic OCT images were evaluated by screening and evaluation experiments. We quantitatively and qualitatively assessed the prognostic accuracy of the synthetic post-therapeutic OCT images. The post-therapeutic OCT images generated by the pix2pixHD algorithm were comparable to the actual images in edema resorption response. Retinal specialists found most synthetic images (62/68) difficult to differentiate from the real ones. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the central macular thickness (CMT) between the synthetic and real OCT images was 26.33 \u00b1 15.81\u00a0\u03bcm. There was no statistical difference in CMT between the synthetic and the real images. In this retrospective study, the application of the pix2pixHD algorithm objectively predicted the short-term response of each patient to anti-VEGF therapy based on OCT images with high accuracy, suggestive of its clinical value, especially for screening patients with relatively poor prognosis and potentially guiding clinical treatment. Importantly, our artificial intelligence-based prediction approach's non-invasiveness, repeatability, and cost-effectiveness can improve compliance and follow-up management of this patient population.", "Human visual processing involves the extraction of both global and local information from a visual stimulus. Such processing may be related to cognitive abilities, which is likely going to change over time as we age. We aimed to investigate the impact of healthy aging on the association between visual global vs local processing and intelligence. In this context, we collected behavioral data during a visual search task in 103 adults (50 younger/53 older). We extracted three metrics reflecting global advantage (faster global than local processing), and visual interference in detecting either local or global features (based on interfering visual distractors). We found that older, but not younger, adults with higher levels of fluid and crystallized intelligence showed stronger signs of global advantage and interference effects during local processing, respectively. The present findings also provide promising clues regarding how participants consider and process their visual world in healthy aging.", "Due to the growing need to provide better global healthcare, computer-based and robotic healthcare equipment that depend on artificial intelligence has seen an increase in development. In order to evaluate artificial intelligence (AI) in computer technology, the Turing test was created. For evaluating the future generation of medical diagnostics and medical robots, it remains an essential qualitative instrument. We propose a novel methodology to assess AI-based healthcare technology that provided verifiable diagnostic accuracy and statistical robustness. In order to run our test, we used a state-of-the-art AI model and compared it to radiologists for checking how generalized the model is and if any biases are prevalent. We achieved results that can evaluate the performance of our chosen model for this study in a clinical setting and we also applied a quantifiable method for evaluating our modified Turing test results using a meta-analytical evaluation framework. His test provides a translational standard for upcoming AI modalities. Our modified Turing test is a notably strong standard to measure the actual performance of the AI model on a variety of edge cases and normal cases and also helps in detecting if the algorithm is biased towards any one type of case. This method extends the flexibility to detect any prevalent biases and also classify the type of bias.", "Modern models for estimating canopy photosynthetic rates (Ac) can be broadly classified into two categories, namely, process-based mechanistic models and artificial intelligence (AI) models, each category having unique strengths (i.e., process-based models have generalizability to a wide range of situations, and AI models can reproduce a complex process using data without prior knowledge about the underlying mechanism). To exploit the strengths of both categories of models, a novel \"hybrid\" canopy photosynthesis model that combines process-based models with an AI model was proposed. In the proposed hybrid model, process-based models for single-leaf photosynthesis and image analysis first transform raw inputs (environmental data and canopy images) into the single-leaf photosynthetic rate (AL) and effective leaf area index (Lc)), after which AL and Lc are fed into an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict Ac. The hybrid model successfully predicted the diurnal cycles of Ac of an eggplant canopy even with a small training dataset and successfully reproduced a typical Ac response to changes in the CO2 concentration outside the range of the training data. The proposed hybrid AI model can provide an effective means to estimate Ac in actual crop fields, where obtaining a large amount of training data is difficult.", "Hematology and bone marrow analysis is central to our understanding of the hematopoietic system and how it responds to insults, and this session presented during the 2022 STP symposium provided a review of current and novel approaches for the evaluation of the hematopoietic system in the context of nonclinical investigations. This publication summarizes the information presented on novel approaches for evaluation of the hematopoietic system using automated hematology analyzers, including details around the quantitative assessment of bone marrow cell suspensions as well as introducing several newly available hematology parameters. It was followed by a discussion on intravital microscopy and live cell imaging and how these methods can assist with de-risking hematopoiesis-associated safety concerns, and a review of recent assays using artificial intelligence for the evaluation of bone marrow.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning and convolutional neuron networks (CNN) is rapidly becoming a realistic prospect in dermatology. Non-melanoma skin cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Dermoscopy has improved physicians' diagnostic accuracy for skin cancer recognition but unfortunately it remains comparatively low. AI could provide invaluable aid in the early evaluation and diagnosis of skin cancer. In the last decade, there has been a breakthrough in new research and publications in the field of AI. Studies have shown that CNN algorithms can classify skin lesions from dermoscopic images with superior or at least equivalent performance compared to clinicians. Even though AI algorithms have shown very promising results for the diagnosis of skin cancer in reader studies, their generalizability and applicability in everyday clinical practice remain elusive. Herein we attempted to summarize the potential pitfalls and challenges of AI that were underlined in reader studies and pinpoint strategies to overcome limitations in future studies. Finally, we tried to analyze the advantages and opportunities that lay ahead for a better future for dermatology and patients, with the potential use of AI in our practices.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and translation between languages. The research on the use of AI in dermatology includes the ability of a machine to correctly classify a skin lesion. Skin cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. All skin cancers have a better prognosis when detected early in their development, hence their early detection is of paramount importance. Dermatologists use a dermatoscope\u2014a specialized magnifying lens to improve their diagnostic capacity. However, even with the use of the dermatoscope, their ability to recognize skin cancer is far from perfect. AI has the ability to learn from dermoscopic images and subsequently provide an image-based diagnosis. Several studies compared the performance of machines and humans in classifying skin lesions from these images and showed that machines can classify skin lesions as good (and sometimes better) than humans. However, the application of AI in everyday clinical practice remains a challenge. In this article, we attempt to summarize the limitations and challenges that researchers found in their studies, and we provide strategies to improve the design of future studies. Finally, we describe the advantages and opportunities that could lay ahead for a better future for dermatology and patients.", "(GPCR)The receptor for TSH receptor (TSHR), a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), is of particular interest as the primary antigen in autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) caused by stimulating TSHR antibodies. To date, only one domain of the extracellular region of the TSHR has been crystallized. We have run a 1000 ns molecular dynamic simulation on a model of the entire TSHR generated by merging the extracellular region of the receptor, obtained using artificial intelligence, with our recent homology model of the transmembrane domain, embedded it in a lipid membrane and solvated it with water and counterions. The simulations showed that the structure of the transmembrane and leucine-rich domains were remarkably constant while the linker region (LR), known more commonly as the 'hinge region,' showed significant flexibility, forming several transient secondary structural elements. Furthermore, the relative orientation of the leucine-rich domain with the rest of the receptor was also seen to be variable. These data suggest that this LR is an intrinsically disordered protein. Furthermore, preliminary data simulating the full TSHR model complexed with its ligand (TSH) showed that (a) there is a strong affinity between the LR and TSH ligand and (b) the association of the LR and the TSH ligand reduces the structural fluctuations in the LR. This full-length model illustrates the importance of the LR in responding to ligand binding and lays the foundation for studies of pathologic TSHR autoantibodies complexed with the TSHR to give further insight into their interaction with the flexible LR.", "An intersemiotic translation is any form of translation that involves at least two different semiotic codes; for example, the translation from words to images, to numerical code, or to non-verbal sounds. One of the most widespread examples of intersemiotic translation in the contemporary world is transposing natural language into machine language in digital environments. In this case, if the source text is a legal text, we encounter a particular type of intersemiotic translation, namely an intersemiotic legal translation in a digital environment. This paper will focus on the intersemiotic legal translation of contracts in digital environments, and is divided into two parts. In the first part (Section Ways of intersemiotically translating a contract using digital tools), we will analyze four possible uses of the intersemiotic translation of contracts in a digital context. In particular, we will highlight the technical characteristics of intersemiotic translation, its limitations, and its potential in different phases of contract management, namely the drafting of the document, the agreement, the archiving of the document, and the execution of contractual clauses. We will examine different digital tools that exploit intersemiotic translation, such as contract drafting tools and online platforms that allow for the conclusion of electronic contracts, document archiving in blockchains, and building smart contracts. When analyzing these uses of intersemiotic translation in the digital environment, we will highlight four types of output that can represent the product of intersemiotic translation in the digital environment: epistemic effects, legal effects, digital effects, and economic effects. In the second part (Section A tool for translating the contract intersemiotically), we will describe a hypothetical prototype that, in light of the four potential uses of intersemiotic translation, could represent a support tool to simplify the communication between professionals and clients through the drafting of legal documents with the aid of dynamic forms and, eventually, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Beyond facilitating the dialogue between legal professionals and their clients, we use interfaces to allow clients to create their own drafts of their documents and the lawyer to work on the drafts drawn up by the customer, correct them, and structure them in order to guarantee the validity of the document. The system can also be designed to archive legal documents and private deeds securely and entrust them to a professional by using blockchain technology and automating the execution of some contractual clauses via smart contract protocols.", "As we have seen throughout history, people and indeed companies can catalyze dramatic changes through invention and innovations. They can create new fields of science that did not exist before. In doing so, new technologies can reshape cities and create unintended consequences. We are now in a different era in which the development of artificial intelligence (AI) is both being rapidly applied in many areas of science and creating ethical challenges that need to be considered. AI may autonomously suggest innovations leading to a revolution in science and health care. What follows is a provocative brief opinion that looks at the future of how new technologies are developed through AI with all its attendant challenges.", "The outbreak of coronavirus in the year 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) prompted widespread illness, death, and extended economic devastation worldwide. In response, numerous countries, including Botswana and South Africa, instituted various clinical public health (CPH) strategies to mitigate and control the disease. However, the emergence of variants of concern (VOC), vaccine hesitancy, morbidity, inadequate and inequitable vaccine supply, and ineffective vaccine roll-out strategies caused continuous disruption of essential services. Based on Botswana and South Africa hospitalization and mortality data, we studied the impact of age and gender on disease severity. Comparative analysis was performed between the two countries to establish a vaccination strategy that could complement the existing CPH strategies. To optimize the vaccination roll-out strategy, artificial intelligence was used to identify the population groups in need of insufficient vaccines. We found that COVID-19 was associated with several comorbidities. However, hypertension and diabetes were more severe and common in both countries. The elderly population aged \u226560 years had 70% of major COVID-19 comorbidities; thus, they should be prioritized for vaccination. Moreover, we found that the Botswana and South Africa populations had similar COVID-19 mortality rates. Hence, our findings should be extended to the rest of Southern African countries since the population in this region have similar demographic and disease characteristics.", "Bimetals are widely used as a thermal tripping mechanism inside the miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) products when an overload current passes through the circuit for a certain period. Experimental, numerical, and, recently artificial intelligence methods are widely used in designing electric components. However, developing the bimetal for MCB products somewhat differs from developing other conductor items since they are strongly related to the electrical, mechanical, and thermal performance of the MCB. The conventional experimental and numerical approaches are time-consuming processes that cannot be easily utilized in optimizing the product's performance within the development lead time. In this study, a simple, fast, robust, and accurate novel methodology has been introduced to predict the temperature rise of the bimetal and other related performance characteristics. The numerical model has been built on the time-based finite difference method to frame the theoretical thermal model of the bimetal. Then, the numerical model has been consolidated by the machine learning (ML) model to take advantage of the experiments to provide an accurate, fast and reliable model finally. The novel model agrees well with the experimental tests, where the maximum error does not exceed 8%. The model has been used to redesign the bimetal of a 32 A MCB product and significantly reduce the maximum temperature by 24 \u00b0C. The novel model is promising since it considerably reduces the required design time, provides accurate predictions, and helps to optimize the performance of the circuit breaker products.", "Background: Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common neurodegenerative disease, while mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be happened in the early stage of AD or PD. Blood biomarkers are considered to be less invasive, less cost and more convenient, and there is tremendous potential for the diagnosis and prediction of neurodegenerative diseases. As a recently mentioned field, artificial intelligence (AI) is often applied in biology and shows excellent results. In this article, we use AI to model PD, AD, MCI data and analyze the possible connections between them. Method: Human blood protein microarray profiles including 156 CT, 50 MCI, 132 PD, 50 AD samples are collected from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). First, we used bioinformatics methods and feature engineering in machine learning to screen important features, constructed artificial neural network (ANN) classifier models based on these features to distinguish samples, and evaluated the model's performance with classification accuracy and Area Under Curve (AUC). Second, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) methods to analyse the pathways and functions in early stage and late stage samples of different diseases, and potential targets for drug intervention by predicting upstream regulators. Result: We used different classifier to construct the model and finally found that ANN model would outperform the traditional machine learning model. In summary, three different classifiers were constructed to be used in different application scenarios, First, we incorporated 6 indicators, including EPHA2, MRPL19, SGK2, to build a diagnostic model for AD with a test set accuracy of up to 98.07%. Secondly, incorporated 15 indicators such as ERO1LB, FAM73B, IL1RN to build a diagnostic model for PD, with a test set accuracy of 97.05%. Then, 15 indicators such as XG, FGFR3 and CDC37 were incorporated to establish a four-category diagnostic model for both AD and PD, with a test set accuracy of 98.71%. All classifier models have an auc value greater than 0.95. Then, we verified that the constructed feature engineering filtered out fewer important features but contained more information, which helped to build a better model. In addition, by classifying the disease types more carefully into early and late stages of AD, MCI, and PD, respectively, we found that early PD may occur earlier than early MCI. Finally, there are 24 proteins that are both differentially expressed proteins and upstream regulators in the disease group versus the normal group, and these proteins may serve as potential therapeutic targets and targets for subsequent studies. Conclusion: The feature engineering we build allows better extraction of information while reducing the number of features, which may help in subsequent applications. Building a classifier based on blood protein profiles using deep learning methods can achieve better classification performance, and it can help us to diagnose the disease early. Overall, it is important for us to study neurodegenerative diseases from both diagnostic and interventional aspects.", "Recent technological advancements in Artificial Intelligence make it easy to create deepfakes and hyper-realistic videos, in which images and video clips are processed to create fake videos that appear authentic. Many of them are based on swapping faces without the consent of the person whose appearance and voice are used. As emotions are inherent in human communication, studying how deepfakes transfer emotional expressions from original to fakes is relevant. In this work, we conduct an in-depth study on facial emotional expression in deepfakes using a well-known face swap-based deepfake database. Firstly, we extracted the photograms from their videos. Then, we analyzed the emotional expression in the original and faked versions of video recordings for all performers in the database. Results show that emotional expressions are not adequately transferred between original recordings and the deepfakes created from them. High variability in emotions and performers detected between original and fake recordings indicates that performer emotion expressiveness should be considered for better deepfake generation or detection.", "Digitalization of healthcare led to the optimization of monitoring, diagnostics, and treatment of the range of disorders. Taking into account recent situation with COVID-19 pandemics, digital technologies allowed to improve management of viral infections via remote monitoring and diagnostics of infected patients. Up to date, various mobile health applications (apps) have been proposed, including apps for the patients diagnosed with cardiovascular pathologies.\nThe presented review aimed at the analyses of a range of mHealth solutions used to improve primary cardiac care. In addition, we studied the factors driving and hindering the wide introduction of mHealth services in the clinics.\nThe work was based on the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The publication search was carried out using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Studies published during the period from 2014 until January 2022 were selected for the analysis. The evaluation of risk of bias for the included studies was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool.\nAn overall 5513 studies were assessed for eligibility after which 39 studies were included.. The main trend in the mobile health for cardiological applications is the use of different types of wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence-platforms. In fact, mobile technology allows remotely to monitor, interpret, and analyze biomedical data collected from the patient.\nThe results of this literature search demonstrated that patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders can potentially benefit from the application of mHealth in cardiology. However, despite the proven advantages of mHealth for cardiology, there are many challenges and concerns regarding effectiveness, safety, reliability and the lack of official regulation and guidelines from official organizations. Such issues require solutions and further work towards a wide implementation of mHealth technologies in cardiac practice.", "Intelligence is often discussed in terms of neural networks in the cerebral cortex, whose evolution has presumably been influenced by Darwinian selection. Here we present molecular evidence that one of the many kinesin motors, KIF14, has evolved to exhibit a special feature in its amino acid sequence that could improve neural networks. The improvement is quantified by comparison of NIF14 sequences for 12 species. The special feature is level sets of synchronized hydrophobic extrema in water wave profiles based on several hydropathic scales. The most effective scale is a new one based on fractals indicative of approach of globular curvatures to self-organized criticality, which summarizes evolutionary trends based on intelligent design.", "An increasing array of tools is being developed using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for cancer imaging. The development of an optimal tool requires multidisciplinary engagement to ensure that the appropriate use case is met, as well as to undertake robust development and testing prior to its adoption into healthcare systems. This multidisciplinary review highlights key developments in the field. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of AI and ML in cancer imaging; considerations for the development of algorithms into tools that can be widely used and disseminated; and the development of the ecosystem needed to promote growth of AI and ML in cancer imaging.", "Accurate assessment of the quality of academic journals is of great significance. While Journal Impact Factor (JIF), calculated by Clarivate and based upon the Web of Science literature database, and CiteScore (CS), developed by Elseiver and based upon the Scopus database, have enjoyed high uptake worldwide, efforts continue towards creation of other scientometric indexes that will provide ever-greater qualitative insights into journal impact. Such efforts have yielded the newly-launched Journal Article Influence Index (JAII), which is based on the Reference Citation Analysis (RCA) database, an open multidisciplinary citation analysis database based on artificial intelligence technology.\nTo evaluate and summarize the similarities and differences between JAII and JIF/CS as journal evaluation indicators, and provide an intuitive method for visual representation of the related data.\nWe searched the Journal Citation Reports to obtain the 2021 JIF list, downloaded the CS list updated in July on the Scopus website, and collected the comprehensive list of 2022 JAIIs from the RCA database (www.referencecitationanalysis.com).\nOur research results revealed that by breaking through the time limit of mainstream journal evaluation methods, the JAII is able to perform well in data reliability, establishing its benefit as a complementary scientometric index to JIF and CS.\nJAII provides comprehensive assessment of the quality and performance of journals.", "Non-invasive diagnostic tools that facilitate visualization of potentially malignant oral lesions and cancers have been introduced. Oral lesions detected by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were compared to reference results based on histological findings. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), along with summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC), area under SROC, sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values, were the outcomes. The DOR of OCT was 86.9190 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.7435, 194.9985), and the area under SROC was 0.951. OCT showed good sensitivity (0.9138; 95% CI: 0.8758, 0.9409) and specificity (0.9110; 95% CI: 0.8568, 0.9460), and a high negative predictive value (0.9225; 95% CI: 0.8863, 0.9478). Diagnostic sensitivity was higher when using artificial intelligence and automated algorithms compared to diagnoses made by clinicians. OCT is non-invasive, provides rapid results without radiation exposure, and can aid in the diagnosis and follow-up of oral cancer and oral precancerous lesions.", "Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) may need to be performed immediately after colonoscopy without additional bowel preparation if active small bowel diseases are suspected. However, it is unclear whether the small bowel cleanliness is adequately maintained even after SBCE is performed immediately after colonoscopy. We compared the small bowel cleanliness scores of the study group (SBCE immediately after colonoscopy) and control group (SBCE alone) using a validated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm (cut-off score\u2009>\u20093.25 for adequate). Cases of SBCE in which polyethylene glycol was used were included retrospectively. Among 85 enrolled cases, 50 cases (58.8%) were the study group. The mean time from the last dose of purgative administration to SBCE was 6.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.94\u00a0h in the study group and 3.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18\u00a0h in the control group. Seventy-five cases (88.2%) were adequate small bowel cleanliness, which was not different between the two groups. The mean small bowel cleanliness score for the study group was 3.970\u2009\u00b1\u20090.603, and for the control group was 3.937\u2009\u00b1\u20090.428. In the study group, better colon preparation resulted in a higher small bowel cleanliness score (p\u2009=\u20090.015). Small bowel cleanliness was also adequately maintained in SBCE immediately after colonoscopy. There was no difference between the time and volume of purgative administration and small bowel cleanliness.", "While clinical Artificial Intelligence (cAI) mortality prediction models and relevant studies have increased, limitations including the lack of external validation studies and inadequate model calibration leading to decreased overall accuracy have been observed. To combat this, we developed and evaluated a novel deep neural network (DNN) and a validation framework to promote transparent cAI development.\nData from Japan's largest ICU database was used to develop the DNN model, predicting in-hospital mortality including ICU and post-ICU mortality by days since ICU discharge. The most important variables to the model were extracted with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to examine the DNN's efficacy as well as develop models that were also externally validated.\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting ICU mortality was 0.94 [0.93-0.95], and 0.91 [0.90-0.92] for in-hospital mortality, ranging between 0.91-0.95 throughout one year since ICU discharge. An external validation using only the top 20 variables resulted with higher AUCs than traditional severity scores.\nOur DNN model consistently generated AUCs between 0.91-0.95 regardless of days since ICU discharge. The 20 most important variables to our DNN, also generated higher AUCs than traditional severity scores regardless of days since ICU discharge. To our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts ICU and in-hospital mortality using cAI by post-ICU discharge days up to over a year. This finding could contribute to increased transparency on cAI applications.", "Background: Cardiac fibrosis has been identified as a major factor in conduction alterations leading to atrial arrhythmias and modification of drug treatment response. Objective: To perform an in silico proof-of-concept study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) ability to identify susceptibility for conduction blocks in simulations on a population of models with diffused fibrotic atrial tissue and anti-arrhythmic drugs. Methods: Activity in 2D cardiac tissue planes were simulated on a population of variable electrophysiological and anatomical profiles using the Koivumaki model for the atrial cardiomyocytes and the Maleckar model for the diffused fibroblasts (0%, 5% and 10% fibrosis area). Tissue sheets were of 2\u00a0cm side and the effect of amiodarone, dofetilide and sotalol was simulated to assess the conduction of the electrical impulse across the planes. Four different AI algorithms (Quadratic Support Vector Machine, QSVM, Cubic Support Vector Machine, CSVM, decision trees, DT, and K-Nearest Neighbors, KNN) were evaluated in predicting conduction of a stimulated electrical impulse. Results: Overall, fibrosis implementation lowered conduction velocity (CV) for the conducting profiles (0% fibrosis: 67.52 \u00b1 7.3\u00a0cm/s; 5%: 58.81 \u00b1 14.04\u00a0cm/s; 10%: 57.56 \u00b1 14.78\u00a0cm/s; p < 0.001) in combination with a reduced 90% action potential duration (0% fibrosis: 187.77 \u00b1 37.62\u00a0ms; 5%: 93.29 \u00b1 82.69\u00a0ms; 10%: 106.37 \u00b1 85.15\u00a0ms; p < 0.001) and peak membrane potential (0% fibrosis: 89.16 \u00b1 16.01 mV; 5%: 70.06 \u00b1 17.08 mV; 10%: 82.21 \u00b1 19.90 mV; p < 0.001). When the antiarrhythmic drugs were present, a total block was observed in most of the profiles. In those profiles in which electrical conduction was preserved, a decrease in CV was observed when simulations were performed in the 0% fibrosis tissue patch (Amiodarone \u0394CV: -3.59 \u00b1 1.52\u00a0cm/s; Dofetilide \u0394CV: -13.43 \u00b1 4.07\u00a0cm/s; Sotalol \u0394CV: -0.023 \u00b1 0.24\u00a0cm/s). This effect was preserved for amiodarone in the 5% fibrosis patch (Amiodarone \u0394CV: -4.96 \u00b1 2.15\u00a0cm/s; Dofetilide \u0394CV: 0.14 \u00b1 1.87\u00a0cm/s; Sotalol \u0394CV: 0.30 \u00b1 4.69\u00a0cm/s). 10% fibrosis simulations showed that part of the profiles increased CV while others showed a decrease in this variable (Amiodarone \u0394CV: 0.62 \u00b1 9.56\u00a0cm/s; Dofetilide \u0394CV: 0.05 \u00b1 1.16\u00a0cm/s; Sotalol \u0394CV: 0.22 \u00b1 1.39\u00a0cm/s). Finally, when the AI algorithms were tested for predicting conduction on input of variables from the population of modelled, Cubic SVM showed the best performance with AUC = 0.95. Conclusion: In silico proof-of-concept study demonstrates that fibrosis can alter the expected behavior of antiarrhythmic drugs in a minority of atrial population models and AI can assist in revealing the profiles that will respond differently.", "Coronavirus continues to spread worldwide, causing various health and economic disruptions. One of the most important approaches to controlling the spread of this disease is to use an artificial intelligence (AI)-based technological intervention, such as a chatbot system. Chatbots can aid in the fight against the spread of COVID-19.\nThis paper introduces COVID-Bot, an intelligent interactive system that can help screen students and confirm their COVID-19 vaccination status.\nThe design and development of COVID-Bot followed the principles of the design science research (DSR) process, which is a research method for creating a new scientific artifact. COVID-Bot was developed and implemented using the SnatchBot chatbot application programming interface (API) and its predefined tools, which are driven by various natural language processing algorithms.\nAn evaluation was carried out through a survey that involved 106 university students in determining the functionality, compatibility, reliability, and usability of COVID-Bot. The findings indicated that 92 (86.8%) of the participants agreed that the chatbot functions well, 85 (80.2%) agreed that it fits well with their mobile devices and their lifestyle, 86 (81.1%) agreed that it has the potential to produce accurate and consistent responses, and 85 (80.2%) agreed that it is easy to use. The average obtained \u03b1 was .87, indicating satisfactory reliability.\nThis study demonstrates that incorporating chatbot technology into the educational system can combat the spread of COVID-19 among university students. The intelligent system does this by interacting with students to determine their vaccination status.", "Endoscopic screening is the widely accepted screening strategy for esophageal squmaous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, massive endoscopic screening is expensive and not cost-efficient, and novel pre-endoscopy detection used as a preliminary screening method arouses new concerns. We are planning to launch an artificial intelligence (AI) assisted sponge cytology for detecting esophageal squmaous high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and above lesions. The aim of this trail is to investigate the efficiency of AI-assisted sponge cytology in population-based screening of early esophageal squmaous epithelial lesions.\nThe study will be prospectively conducted in five regions with a high prevalence of ESCC. AI-assisted sponge cytology and endoscopic examination will be sequentially performed. Based on our previous data, at least 864 patients with esophageal HGIN and above lesions are needed to achieve enough statistical power. And, a calculated 112,500 individuals with high risks of ESCC will be recruited. In the first stage, each 24,000 participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited on a voluntary basis. Setting pathological results as standard reference, diagnostic threshold and according performance of AI-assisted detection will be evaluated. A prediction model will be constructed by co-analyzing cytological results and relevant risk factors. Then, an external validation cohort will be used for validation of the model efficiency. Also, cost-efficiency analysis will be performed. This study protocol was registered on chineseclinicaltrial.gov (ChiCTR1900028524).\nOur study will determine whether this AI-assisted sponge cytology can be used as an effective pre-endoscopy detection tool for large-scale screening for ESCC in high-risk areas.", "As the energy and hardware investments necessary for conventional high-precision digital computing continue to explode in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), a change in paradigm that can trade precision for energy and resource efficiency is being sought for many computing applications. Stochastic computing (SC) is an attractive alternative since, unlike digital computers, which require many logic gates and a high transistor volume to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, sorting, etc., SC can implement the same using simple logic gates. While it is possible to accelerate SC using traditional silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, the need for extensive hardware investment to generate stochastic bits (s-bits), the fundamental computing primitive for SC, makes it less attractive. Memristor and spin-based devices offer natural randomness but depend on hybrid designs involving CMOS peripherals for accelerating SC, which increases area and energy burden. Here, the limitations of existing and emerging technologies are overcome, and a standalone SC architecture embedded in memory and based on 2D\u00a0memtransistors is experimentally demonstrated. The monolithic and non-von-Neumann SC architecture occupies a small hardware footprint and consumes a miniscule amount of energy (<1\u00a0nJ) for both s-bit generation and arithmetic operations, highlighting the benefits of SC.", "Self-determination theory (SDT) considers motivation as a multidimensional phenomenon, with different levels of intensity, purposes, intentions, wills and autonomies. It distinguishes between intrinsic motivation (IM), extrinsic motivation (EM) and amotivation (AM). In this paper, we are going to focus on extrinsic motivation, which is related to those tasks that the subject performs without having a purpose in themselves, and which is composed of identified regulation, introjected regulation and external regulation. The aim of this research is to analyse the relationship between them and emotional intelligence in 165 students with university degrees related to Physical Activity and Sport Sciences. The main findings of this work lie mainly in the demonstration of the fact that emotional intelligence is a predictor of identified regulation, introjected regulation and external regulation.", "Exposure to urban birth, childhood trauma, and lower Intelligence Quotient (IQ) were the most well-established risk factors for schizophrenia in developed countries. In developing countries, whether urban birth is a risk factor for schizophrenia and how these factors are related to one another remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether IQ mediates the relationship between urban birth or childhood trauma and first-episode schizophrenia (FES) in China. Birthplace, childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ), and IQ were collected from 144 patients with FES and 256 healthy controls (HCs). Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the associations between birthplace, childhood trauma, IQ, and FES. Furthermore, mediation analysis was used to explore the mediation of IQ in the relationship between birthplace or childhood trauma and FES. After adjusting for age, sex and educational attainment, the final model identified urban birth (odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20093.15, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.54, 6.44) and childhood trauma (OR\u2009=\u20092.79, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.92, 4.06) were associated an elevated risk for FES. The 52.94% total effect of birthplace on the risk of FES could be offset by IQ (indirect effect/direct effect). The association between childhood trauma and FES could be partly explained by IQ (22.5%). In total, the mediation model explained 70.5% of the total variance in FES. Our study provides evidence that urban birth and childhood trauma are associated with an increased risk of FES. Furthermore, IQ mediates the relationship between urban birth or childhood trauma and FES.", "Insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) are indicated for long-term monitoring of patients with unexplained syncope or who are at risk for cardiac arrhythmias. The volume of ICM-transmitted information may result in long data review times to identify true and clinically relevant arrhythmias.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate whether artificial intelligence (AI) may improve ICM detection accuracy.\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients implanted with the Confirm RxTM ICM (Abbott) and followed in a prospective observational study. This device continuously monitors subcutaneous electrocardiograms (SECGs) and transmits to clinicians information about detected arrhythmias and patient-activated symptomatic episodes. All SECGs were classified by expert electrophysiologists and by the WillemTM AI algorithm (IDOVEN).\nDuring mean follow-up of 23 months, of 20 ICM patients (mean age 68 \u00b1 12 years; 50% women), 19 had 2261 SECGs recordings associated with cardiac arrhythmia detections or patient symptoms. True arrhythmias occurred in 11 patients: asystoles in 2, bradycardias in 3, ventricular tachycardias in 4, and atrial tachyarrhythmias (atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation [AT/AF]) in 10; with 6 patients having >1 arrhythmia type. AI algorithm overall accuracy for arrhythmia classification was 95.4%, with 97.19% sensitivity, 94.52% specificity, 89.74% positive predictive value, and 98.55% negative predictive value. Application of AI would have reduced the number of false-positive results by 98.0% overall: 94.0% for AT/AF, 87.5% for ventricular tachycardia, 99.5% for bradycardia, and 98.8% for asystole.\nApplication of AI to ICM-detected episodes is associated with high classification accuracy and may significantly reduce health care staff workload by triaging ICM data.", "Breast density (BD) and breast arterial calcifications (BAC) can expand the role of mammography. In premenopause, BD is related to body fat composition: breast adipose tissue and total volume are potential indicators of fat storage in visceral depots, associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Women with fatty breast have an increased likelihood of hypercholesterolemia. Women without cardiometabolic diseases with higher BD have a lower risk of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chest pain, and peripheral vascular disease, while those with lower BD are at increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. BAC, the expression of Monckeberg sclerosis, are associated with CVD risk. Their prevalence, 13\u00a0% overall, rises after menopause and is reduced in women aged over 65 receiving hormonal replacement therapy. Due to their distinct pathogenesis, BAC are associated with hypertension but not with other cardiovascular risk factors. Women with BAC have an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and CVD death; furthermore, moderate to severe BAC load is associated with coronary artery disease. The clinical use of BAC assessment is limited by their time-consuming manual/visual quantification, an issue possibly solved by artificial intelligence-based approaches addressing BAC complex topology as well as their large spectrum of extent and x-ray attenuations. A link between BD, BAC, and osteoporosis has been reported, but data are still inconclusive. Systematic, standardised reporting of BD and BAC should be encouraged.", "Accurate and reliable forecasting of emerging dominant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants enables policymakers and vaccine makers to get prepared for future waves of infections. The last three waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by dominant variants Omicron (BA.1), BA.2, and BA.4/BA.5 were accurately foretold by our artificial intelligence (AI) models built with biophysics, genotyping of viral genomes, experimental data, algebraic topology, and deep learning. Based on newly available experimental data, we analyzed the impacts of all possible viral spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Our analysis sheds light on viral evolutionary mechanisms, i.e., natural selection through infectivity strengthening and antibody resistance. We forecast that BA.2.10.4, BA.2.75, BQ.1.1, and particularly, BA.2.75+R346T, have high potential to become new dominant variants to drive the next surge.", "The role of clinical practice guidelines has changed dramatically the past 50 years. Both beneficial, as also having some disadvantageous effects. Considering the international developments, such as a growing body of evidence and evolving methodologies, some limits might be in reach or already been reached. The solution thereof is part nationally and part internationally. Internationally because of new methodologies and technologies, such as use of artificial intelligence, and nationally in a more coherent approach. Coherent not only in medical disciplines, but also in policies of government, regulators, and health insurers. This calls for a renewed, integral and an all-encompassing vision.", "In light of pending capacity crunch in information era, orbital-angular-momenta-carrying vortex beams are gaining traction thanks to enlarged transmission capability. However, high-order beams are confronted with fundamental limits of nontrivial divergence or distortion, which consequently intensifies research on new optical states like low-order fractional vortex beams. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an alternative mean to increase the capacity by simultaneously utilizing multiple non-orthogonal states of structured light, challenging a prevailing view of using orthogonal states as information carriers. Specifically, six categories of beams are jointly recognized with accuracy of >99% by harnessing an adapted deep neural network, thus providing the targeted wide bandwidth. We then manifest the efficiency by sending/receiving a grayscale image in 256-ary mode encoding and shift keying schemes, respectively. Moreover, the well-trained model is able to realize high fidelity recognition (accuracy >0.8) onto structured beams under unknown turbulence and restricted receiver aperture size. To gain insights of the framework, we further interpret the network by revealing the contributions of intensity signals from different positions. This work holds potential in intelligence-assisted large-capacity and secure communications, meeting ever growing demand of daily information bandwidth.", "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a complete ecosystem encompassing various communication technologies, sensors, hardware, and software. IoT cutting-edge technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enhanced the traditional healthcare system considerably. The conventional healthcare system faces many challenges, including avoidable long wait times, high costs, a conventional method of payment, unnecessary long travel to medical centers, and mandatory periodic doctor visits. A Smart healthcare system, Internet of Things (IoT), and AI are arguably the best-suited tailor-made solutions for all the flaws related to traditional healthcare systems. The primary goal of this study is to determine the impact of IoT, AI, various communication technologies, sensor networks, and disease detection/diagnosis in Cardiac healthcare through a systematic analysis of scholarly articles. Hence, a total of 104 fundamental studies are analyzed for the research questions purposefully defined for this systematic study. The review results show that deep learning emerges as a promising technology along with the combination of IoT in the domain of E-Cardiac care with enhanced accuracy and real-time clinical monitoring. This study also pins down the key benefits and significant challenges for E-Cardiology in the domains of IoT and AI. It further identifies the gaps and future research directions related to E-Cardiology, monitoring various Cardiac parameters, and diagnosis patterns.", "Bipolar disorder is a highly heritable neuropsychiatric condition affecting more than 1% of the human population. Lithium salts are commonly prescribed as a mood stabilizer for individuals with bipolar disorder. Lithium is clinically effective in approximately half of treated individuals, and their genetic backgrounds are known to influence treatment outcomes. While the mechanism of lithium's therapeutic action is unclear, it stimulates adult neural progenitor cell proliferation, similar to some antidepressant drugs.\nTo identify common genetic variants that modulate lithium-induced proliferation, we conducted an EdU incorporation assay in a library of 80 genotyped human neural progenitor cells treated with lithium. These data were used to perform a genome-wide association study to identify common genetic variants that influence lithium-induced neural progenitor cell proliferation. We manipulated the expression of a putatively causal gene using CRISPRi/a (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference/activation) constructs to experimentally verify lithium-induced proliferation effects.\nWe identified a locus on chr3p21.1 associated with lithium-induced proliferation. This locus is also associated with bipolar disorder risk, schizophrenia risk, and interindividual differences in intelligence. We identified a single gene, GNL3, whose expression temporally increased in an allele-specific fashion following lithium treatment. Experimentally increasing the expression of GNL3 led to increased proliferation under baseline conditions, while experimentally decreasing GNL3 expression suppressed lithium-induced proliferation.\nOur experiments reveal that common genetic variation modulates lithium-induced neural progenitor proliferation and that GNL3 expression is necessary for the full proliferation-stimulating effects of lithium. These results suggest that performing genome-wide associations in genetically diverse human cell lines is a useful approach to discover context-specific pharmacogenomic effects.", "Home blood pressure (BP) monitoring is recommended for people with hypertension; however, meta-analyses have demonstrated that BP improvements are related to additional coaching support in combination with self-monitoring, with little or no effect of self-monitoring alone. High-contact coaching requires substantial resources and may be difficult to deliver via human coaching models.\nThis observational study assessed changes in BP and body weight following participation in a fully digital program called Lark Hypertension Care with coaching powered by artificial intelligence (AI).\nParticipants (N=864) had a baseline systolic BP (SBP) \u2265120 mm Hg, provided their baseline body weight, and had reached at least their third month in the program. The primary outcome was the change in SBP at 3 and 6 months, with secondary outcomes of change in body weight and associations of changes in SBP and body weight with participant demographics, characteristics, and program engagement.\nBy month 3, there was a significant drop of -5.4 mm Hg (95% CI -6.5 to -4.3; P<.001) in mean SBP from baseline. BP did not change significantly (ie, the SBP drop maintained) from 3 to 6 months for participants who provided readings at both time points (P=.49). Half of the participants achieved a clinically meaningful drop of \u22655 mm Hg by month 3 (178/349, 51.0%) and month 6 (98/199, 49.2%). The magnitude of the drop depended on starting SBP. Participants classified as hypertension stage 2 had the largest mean drop in SBP of -12.4 mm Hg (SE 1.2 mm Hg) by month 3 and -13.0 mm Hg (SE 1.6 mm Hg) by month 6; participants classified as hypertension stage 1 lowered by -5.2 mm Hg (SE 0.8) mm Hg by month 3 and -7.3 mm Hg (SE 1.3 mm Hg) by month 6; participants classified as elevated lowered by -1.1 mm Hg (SE 0.7 mm Hg) by month 3 but did not drop by month 6. Starting SBP (\u03b2=.11; P<.001), percent weight change (\u03b2=-.36; P=.02), and initial BMI (\u03b2=-.56; P<.001) were significantly associated with the likelihood of lowering SBP \u22655 mm Hg by month 3. Percent weight change acted as a mediator of the relationship between program engagement and drop in SBP. The bootstrapped unstandardized indirect effect was -0.0024 (95% CI -0.0052 to 0; P=.002).\nA hypertension care program with coaching powered by AI was associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in SBP following 3 and 6 months of program participation. Percent weight change was significantly associated with the likelihood of achieving a \u22655 mm Hg drop in SBP. An AI-powered solution may offer a scalable approach to helping individuals with hypertension achieve clinically meaningful reductions in their BP and associated risk of cardiovascular disease and other serious adverse outcomes via healthy lifestyle changes such as weight loss.", "Xephilio OCT-S1 can capture single-acquisition 23\u2009\u00d7\u200920-mm wide-field swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) images and high-resolution images using artificial intelligence. We aimed to evaluate the ability of wide-field SS-OCTA in the detection of retinal neovascularizations (NVs) in eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).\nThis retrospective study included 64 eyes of 36 patients (age, 57\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u00a0years; 10 female, 26 male) with PDR. All patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmological examination, including fluorescein angiography (FA), as well as fovea- and disc-centered 23\u2009\u00d7\u200920-mm OCTA imaging (A-scan/B-scan, 928/807). We compared and examined the number of NV sites identified using conventional methods (merging the findings from biomicroscopy/color fundus photography, FA) and the number of NV sites identified using vitreoretinal interface and superficial retinal slabs of wide-field SS-OCTA images, including the position of NVs (nasal upper, nasal lower, temporal upper, temporal lower, or disc).\nWe identified 168 NVs (32/40/45/35/16, in the abovementioned order) using the conventional method. Fovea-centered 23\u2009\u00d7\u200920-mm OCTA images revealed 162 (96%) NVs (27/39/45/35/16). This method tended to miss nasal NV. In contrast, disc-centered 23\u2009\u00d7\u200920-mm OCTA images identified nearly all NVs, detecting 166 (99%) NVs (32/40/44/34/16) in total. All NVs could be visualized using two wide-field OCTA images: fovea- and disc-centered.\nWide-field (23\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u00a0mm) SS-OCTA-especially disc-centered-using Xephilio OCT-S1 identified nearly all NVs in eyes with PDR, with a single acquisition, thereby demonstrating its potential clinical application.", "Recent advances and accomplishments of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep generative models have established their usefulness in medicinal applications, especially in drug discovery and development. To correctly apply AI, the developer and user face questions such as which protocols to consider, which factors to scrutinize, and how the deep generative models can integrate the relevant disciplines. This review summarizes classical and newly developed AI approaches, providing an updated and accessible guide to the broad computational drug discovery and development community. We introduce deep generative models from different standpoints and describe the theoretical frameworks for representing chemical and biological structures and their applications. We discuss the data and technical challenges and highlight future directions of multimodal deep generative models for accelerating drug discovery.", "For patients using basal-bolus insulin therapy, it is widespread clinical practice to aim for a 50-50 ratio between basal and total daily bolus. However, this practice was based on a small study of individuals without diabetes. To assess the rule in real-world practice, we retrospectively analyzed patients on basal-bolus therapy that was adjusted at least weekly by an artificial intelligence-driven titration within the d-Nav\u00ae Insulin Management Technology.\nWe obtained de-identified data from the Diabetes Centre of Ulster Hospital for patients with four inclusion criteria: type 2 Diabetes (T2D), on d-Nav >6 months, on basal-bolus insulin therapy >80% of the time (based on insulin analogs), and no gap in data >3 months.\nWe assembled a cohort of 306 patients, followed by the d-Nav service for 3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8\u2009years (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD), corresponding to about 180 autonomous insulin dose titrations and about 5000 autonomous individual dose recommendations per patient. After an initial run-in period, mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values in the cohort were maintained close to 7%. Surprisingly, in just over three-quarters of the cohort, the average basal insulin fraction was <50%; in half of the cohort average basal insulin fraction <41.2%; and in one-quarter the basal insulin fraction was <33.6%. Further, the basal insulin fraction did not remain static over time. In half of the patients, the basal insulin fraction varied by \u22651.9\u00d7; and, in 25% of the patients, \u22652.5\u00d7.\nOur data show that a 50-50 ratio of basal-to-bolus insulin does not generally apply to patients with T2D who successfully maintain stable glycemia. Therefore, the 50-50 ratio should not serve as an ongoing treatment guide. Moreover, our results emphasize the importance of at least weekly insulin titrations.", "AgeTech involves the use of emerging technologies to support the health, well-being and independent living of older adults. In this paper we focus on how AgeTech based on artificial intelligence (AI) may better support older adults to remain in their own living environment for longer, provide social connectedness, support wellbeing and mental health, and enable social participation. In order to assess and better understand the positive as well as negative outcomes of AI-based AgeTech, a critical analysis of ethical design, digital equity, and policy pathways is required. A crucial question is how AI-based AgeTech may drive practical, equitable, and inclusive multilevel solutions to support healthy, active ageing.In our paper, we aim to show that a focus on equity is key for AI-based AgeTech if it is to realize its full potential. We propose that equity should not just be an extra benefit or minimum requirement, but the explicit aim of designing AI-based health tech. This means that social determinants that affect the use of or access to these technologies have to be addressed. We will explore how complexity management as a crucial element of AI-based AgeTech may potentially create and exacerbate social inequities by marginalising or ignoring social determinants. We identify bias, standardization, and access as main ethical issues in this context and subsequently, make recommendations as to how inequities that stem form AI-based AgeTech can be addressed.", "Perinatal markers of prenatal development are associated with offspring psychiatric symptoms. However, there is little research investigating the specificity of perinatal markers for the development of specific disorders. This study aimed to explore if perinatal markers are specifically associated with adolescent substance use disorder (SUDs).\nAdolescent participants from two study centers, one for SUD patients (n\u2009=\u2009196) and one for general psychopathology (n\u2009=\u2009307), were recruited for participation. Since the SUD participants presented with a number of comorbid disorders, we performed a 1-on-1 matching procedure, based on age, gender, and specific pattern of comorbid disorders. This procedure resulted in n\u2009=\u200951 participants from each group. From all participants and their mothers we recorded perinatal markers (mode of birth, weeks of completed pregnancy, birth weight, Apgar score after 5\u00a0min) as well as intelligence quotient (IQ). The SUD sample additionally filled out the Youth Safe Report (YSR) as well as the PQ-16 and the DUDIT. We aimed to distinguish the two groups (SUD sample vs. general psychiatric sample) based on the perinatal variables via a logistic regression analysis. Additionally, linear regressions were performed for the total group and the subgroups to assess the relationship between perinatal variables and IQ, YSR, DUDIT and PQ-16.\nThe perinatal variables were not able to predict group membership (X2 [4]\u2009=\u20094.77, p\u2009=\u2009.312, Cox & Snell R\u00b2 = 0.053). Odds ratios indicated a small increase in probability to belonging to the general psychiatric sample instead of the SUD sample if birth was completed via C-section. After Bonferroni-correction, the linear regression models showed no relation between perinatal markers and IQ (p\u2009=\u2009.60, R\u00b2 = 0.068), YSR (p\u2009=\u2009.09, R\u00b2 = 0.121), DUDIT (p\u2009=\u2009.65, R\u00b2 = 0.020), and PQ-16 (p\u2009=\u2009.73, R\u00b2 =0.021).\nPerinatal markers were not able to distinguish SUD patients from patients with diverse psychopathologies. This pattern contradicts previous findings, perhaps because our chosen markers reflect general processes instead of specific mechanistic explanations. Future studies should take care to investigate specific prenatal markers and associate them with psychopathology on the symptom level.", "Electronically powered drug delivery devices enable a controlled drug release route for a more convenient and painless way with reduced side effects. The current advances in microfabrication and microelectronics have facilitated miniaturization and intelligence with the integration of sensors and wireless communication modules. These devices have become an essential component of commercialized on-demand drug delivery.\nThis review aims to provide a concise overview of current progress in electronically powered drug devices, focusing on delivery strategies, manufacturing techniques, and control circuit design with specific examples.\nThe application of electronically powered drug delivery systems is now considered a feasible therapeutic approach with improved drug release efficiency and increased patient comfort. It is anticipated that these technologies will gradually fulfill clinical needs and resolve commercialization challenges in the future. This review discusses the current advances in electronic drug delivery devices, especially focusing on designing strategies to achieve an effective drug release, as well as the perspectives and challenges for future applications in clinical therapy.", "The number of stomach cancer (SC) patients is increasing sharply every year, and gastroscope is a common method to check stomach-related diseases. A bulging lesion in the stomach is encountered during a gastroscopy. Due to the change in eating habits, the enhancement of health awareness, and the wide application of gastroscopy, the detection rate and cure rate of tumors have been significantly improved. This has certain clinical value for the early diagnosis and treatment of early SC. In this paper, based on the background of artificial intelligence, image segmentation technology is used to analyze and process the detection results of SC, so as to judge the effect of drug treatment. A total of 1408 gastric bulge lesions were investigated in 11023 patients during the one-year period 2019-2020. It also analyzed the age, lesion location, size, pathological type, and tumor detection results of 1408 patients. The experiment showed that among the 289 cases of submucosal bulging lesions, the detection rates of the young group, middle-aged group, and elderly group were 14.9% (43/289), 67.5% (195/289), and 17.6% (51/289), respectively. Among them, middle-aged people aged 41-65 have the highest detection rate. The incidence of gastric polyps was similar between different age groups. But with age, the rate of fundic gland polyps increases. The incidence of SC is not related to the age of the patient, but to its pathological type. The incidence of SC in middle-aged and elderly people is significantly higher than that in young people. SC is more common in the cardia, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors are most common with submucosal protrusion.", "Lately, Augmented Analytics (AA) has increasingly been introduced as a tool for transforming data into valuable insights for decision-making, and it has gained attention as one of the most advanced methods to facilitate modern analytics for different types of users. AA can be defined as a combination of Business Intelligence (BI) and the advanced features of Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the massive growth in data diversity, the traditional approach to BI has become less useful and requires additional work to obtain timely results. However, the power of AA that uses AI can be leveraged in BI platforms with the use of Machine Learning (ML) and natural language comprehension to automate the cycle of business analytics. Despite the various benefits for businesses and end users in converting from BI to AA, research on this trend has been limited. This study presents a comparison of the capabilities of the traditional BI and its augmented version in the business analytics cycle. Our findings show that AA enhances analysis, reduces time, and supports data preparation, visualization, modelling, and generation of insights. However, AI-driven analytics cannot fully replace human decision-making, as most business problems cannot be solved purely by machines. Human interaction and perspectives are essential, and decision-makers still play an important role in sharing and operationalizing findings.", "Artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, is gaining extensive attention for its excellent performance in medical image analysis. It can automatically make a quantitative assessment of complex medical images and help doctors to make more accurate diagnoses. In recent years, AI based on ultrasound has been shown to be very helpful in diffuse liver diseases and focal liver lesions, such as analyzing the severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver and the stage of liver fibrosis, identifying benign and malignant liver lesions, predicting the microvascular invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma, curative transarterial chemoembolization effect, and prognoses after thermal ablation. Moreover, AI based on endoscopic ultrasonography has been applied in some gastrointestinal diseases, such as distinguishing gastric mesenchymal tumors, detection of pancreatic cancer and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and predicting the preoperative tumor deposits in rectal cancer. This review focused on the basic technical knowledge about AI and the clinical application of AI in ultrasound of liver and gastroenterology diseases. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future perspectives of AI.", "Attention mechanisms are one of the most frequently used architectures in the development of artificial intelligence because they can process contextual information efficiently. Various artificial intelligence architectures, such as Transformer for processing natural language, image data, etc., include the Attention. Various improvements have been made to enhance its performance since Attention is a powerful component to realize artificial intelligence. The time complexity of Attention depends on the square of the input sequence length. Developing methods to improve the time complexity of Attention is one of the most popular research topics. Attention is a mechanism that conveys contextual information of input sequences to downstream networks. Thus, if one wants to improve the performance of processing contextual information, the focus should not be confined only on improving Attention but also on devising other similar mechanisms as possible alternatives. In this study, we devised an alternative mechanism called \"Relation\" that can understand the context information of sequential data. Relation is easy to implement, and its time complexity depends only on the length of the sequences; a comparison of the performance of Relation and Attention on several benchmark datasets showed that the context processing capability of Relation is comparable to that of Attention but with less computation time. Processing contextual information at high speeds would be useful because natural language processing and biological sequence processing sometimes deal with very long sequences. Hence, Relation is an ideal option for processing context information.", "Imaging plays a pivotal role in the noninvasive assessment of cystic fibrosis (CF)-related lung damage, which remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in children with CF. The development of new imaging techniques has significantly changed clinical practice, and advances in therapies have posed diagnostic and monitoring challenges. The authors summarise these challenges and offer new perspectives in the use of imaging for children with CF for both clinicians and radiologists. This article focuses on chest radiography and CT, which are the two main radiologic techniques used in most cystic fibrosis centres. Advantages and disadvantages of radiography and CT for imaging in CF are described, with attention to new developments in these techniques, such as the use of artificial intelligence (AI) image analysis strategies to improve the sensitivity of radiography and CT and the introduction of the photon-counting detector CT scanner to increase spatial resolution at no dose expense.", "Big Data, and the derived analysis techniques, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, have been considered a revolution in the modern practice of medicine. Big Data comes from multiple sources, encompassing electronic health records, clinical studies, imaging data, registries, administrative databases, patient-reported outcomes and OMICS profiles. The main objective of such analyses is to unveil hidden associations and patterns. In cardiac surgery, the main targets for the use of Big Data are the construction of predictive models to recognize patterns or associations better representing the individual risk or prognosis compared to classical surgical risk scores. The results of these studies contributed to kindle the interest for personalized medicine and contributed to\u00a0recognize the limitations of randomized controlled trials in representing the real world. However, the main sources of evidence for guidelines and recommendations remain RCTs and meta-analysis. The extent of the revolution of Big Data and new analytical models in cardiac surgery is yet to be determined.", "The whole healthcare system is evolving fast due to environmental pressure related to pandemics, climate change, personnel shortages, and financial limitations, to name but a few. Nurses are central actors in the sustainability of healthcare systems. Rapid technological development can support innovative means for holistic and applied critical thinking to improve healthcare delivery based on the uniqueness of nursing. Nurses need to develop adaptive and scientific skills regarding technologies and develop and apply these for better use of \"smart\" systems in care delivery. The paradigm shift in nursing roles will impact all levels of care, from primary to specialized care, all age groups, from newborn to elderly care, as well as all domains, such as preventive, reparative, rehabilitation, and palliative care. The impact of technologies on human behavior addresses human- factors interaction, computer interaction, and other effects of technologies on wellbeing, including but not limited to robots and artificial intelligence -based assisting nursing deliveries. Nursing competencies need to be developed at all levels of education to prepare a mindset and culture of the healthcare workforce in a digital health system. Gamification and simulation as educational tools help prepare educators to educate healthcare clinicians and researchers who become key mediators between technologies and practice.", "COVID-19 has infected millions of people worldwide over the past few years. The main technique used for COVID-19 detection is reverse transcription, which is expensive, sensitive, and requires medical expertise. X-ray imaging is an alternative and more accessible technique. This study aimed to improve detection accuracy to create a computer-aided diagnostic tool. Combining other artificial intelligence applications techniques with radiological imaging can help detect different diseases. This study proposes a technique for the automatic detection of COVID-19 and other chest-related diseases using digital chest X-ray images of suspected patients by applying transfer learning (TL) algorithms. For this purpose, two balanced datasets, Dataset-1 and Dataset-2, were created by combining four public databases and collecting images from recently published articles. Dataset-1 consisted of 6000 chest X-ray images with 1500 for each class. Dataset-2 consisted of 7200 images with 1200 for each class. To train and test the model, TL with nine pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was used with augmentation as a preprocessing method. The network was trained to classify using five classifiers: two-class classifier (normal and COVID-19); three-class classifier (normal, COVID-19, and viral pneumonia), four-class classifier (normal, viral pneumonia, COVID-19, and tuberculosis (Tb)), five-class classifier (normal, bacterial pneumonia, COVID-19, Tb, and pneumothorax), and six-class classifier (normal, bacterial pneumonia, COVID-19, viral pneumonia, Tb, and pneumothorax). For two, three, four, five, and six classes, our model achieved a maximum accuracy of 99.83, 98.11, 97.00, 94.66, and 87.29%, respectively.", "Wielding modern technology in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) or deep learning (DL) can utilize the best possible latest computer application in intricate decision-making and enigmatic problem-solving. It has been recommended in many fields. However, it is a long way from achieving an ambitious genuine intention when it comes to understanding and identifying any headache condition or classification, and using it error-free. No studies hitherto formalized any headache AI models to accurately\u00a0classify\u00a0headaches.\u00a0 A machine's job can be arduous when incorporating an emotional dimension in decision making, re-challenging its own diagnosis by keeping a differential\u00a0at all times, where even experienced neurologists or headache experts sometimes find it demanding to make a precise analysis and formulate a methodical plan. This could be because of spanning clinical presentation at a given moment of time or a change in clinical pattern over time which apparently could be due to intercrossing multiple pathophysiologies. We did a short literature review on the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in headache classification. This brings forth a minuscule insight into the vastness of headaches and the perpetual effort and exploration headache may demand from AI when trying to scrutinize its classification. Undoubtedly, AI or DL could better be utilized in identifying the red flags of headache, as it might help our patients at home or the primary care physicians/practicing doctors/non- neurologists in their clinic to triage the headache patients if they need an imperative higher center referral to a neurologist for advanced evaluation. This outlook can limit the burden on a handful of headache specialists by minimizing the referrals to a tertiary care setting.", "To keep pace with global energy efficiency trends and, in particular, emission reduction targets in the maritime sector, both onshore and maritime power distribution systems need to be adapted to the relevant new technologies and concepts. As an important link in the distribution chain, medium-voltage switchgear (MV) is expected to be stable and reliable while operating as efficiently as possible. Failures of MV equipment, while rare because the equipment must be safe to handle and use, have far-reaching consequences. The consequences of such failures, whether to the shore or marine power system, present risks to the entire power plant, so an accurate assessment of equipment condition is required to identify potential failures early. The solution is an emerging concept of digital switchgear, where the implementation of sensor technology and communication protocols enables effective condition monitoring, and the creation of a database that, when combined with machine learning algorithms, enables predictive maintenance and/or fault detection. This paper presents, step by step, the previous challenges, the current research (divided into predictive maintenance, condition monitoring, and fault detection categories), and the future directions in this field. The use of artificial intelligence is discussed to eliminate the disadvantage of manually interpreting operational data, and recommendations for future work are formulated, such as the need to standardize test procedures and data sets to train and compare different algorithms before they are used in practice.", "Understanding the structure of a protein complex is crucial in determining its function. However, retrieving accurate 3D structures from microscopy images is highly challenging, particularly as many imaging modalities are two-dimensional. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have been applied to this problem, primarily using voxel based approaches to analyse sets of electron microscopy images. Here we present a deep learning solution for reconstructing the protein complexes from a number of 2D single molecule localization microscopy images, with the solution being completely unconstrained. Our convolutional neural network coupled with a differentiable renderer predicts pose and derives a single structure. After training, the network is discarded, with the output of this method being a structural model which fits the data-set. We demonstrate the performance of our system on two protein complexes: CEP152 (which comprises part of the proximal toroid of the centriole) and centrioles.", "Three-dimensional surgical simulation, already in use for hepatic surgery, can be used in pancreatic surgery. However, some problems still need to be overcome to achieve more precise pancreatic surgical simulation. The present study evaluates the performance of SYNAPSE VINCENT\u00ae (version 6.6, Fujifilm Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in the semiautomated surgical simulation of the pancreatic parenchyma, pancreatic ducts, and peripancreatic vessels using an artificial intelligence (AI) engine designed with deep learning algorithms. One-hundred pancreatic cancer patients and a control group of 100 nonpancreatic cancer patients were enrolled. The evaluation methods for visualizing the extraction were compared using the Dice coefficient (DC). In the pancreatic cancer patients, tumor size, position, and stagewise correlations with the pancreatic parenchymal DC were analyzed. The relationship between the pancreatic duct diameter and the DC, and between the manually and AI-measured diameters of the pancreatic duct were analyzed. In the pancreatic cancer/control groups, the pancreatic parenchymal DC and pancreatic duct extraction were 0.83/0.86 and 0.84/0.77. The DC of the arteries (portal veins/veins) and associated sensitivity and specificity were 0.89/0.88 (0.89/0.88), 0.85/0.83 (0.85/0.82), and 0.82/0.81 (0.84/0.81), respectively. No correlations were observed between pancreatic parenchymal DC and tumor size, position, or stage. No correlation was observed between the pancreatic duct diameter and the DC. A positive correlation (r = 0.61, p<0.001) was observed between the manually and AI-measured diameters of the pancreatic duct. Extraction of the pancreatic parenchyma, pancreatic duct, and surrounding vessels with the SYNAPSE VINCENT\u00ae AI engine assumed to be useful as surgical simulation.", "The expansion of the availability of advanced imaging methods needs more time, expertise, and resources which is in contrast to the primary goal of the imaging techniques. To overcome most of these difficulties, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used. A number of studies used AI models for multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and reported diverse results. Therefore, we aim to perform a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis study on the role of AI in the diagnosis of MS.\nWe performed a systematic search using four databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE. Studies that applied deep learning or AI to the diagnosis of MS based on any modalities were considered eligible in our study. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and area under curve (AUC) were pooled with a random-effects model and 95% confidence interval (CI).\nAfter the screening, 41 articles with 5989 individuals met the inclusion criteria and were included in our qualitative and quantitative synthesis. Our analysis showed that the overall accuracy among studies was 94% (95%CI: 93%, 96%). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95%CI: 90%, 95%) and 93% (95%CI: 90%, 96%), respectively. Furthermore, our analysis showed 92% precision in MS diagnosis for AI studies (95%CI: 88%, 97%). Also, the overall pooled AUC was 93% (95%CI: 89%, 96%).\nOverall, AI models can further improve our diagnostic practice in MS patients. Our results indicate that the use of AI can aid the clinicians in accurate diagnosis of MS and improve current diagnostic approaches as most of the parameters including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and AUC were considerably high, especially when using MRI data.", "Artificial intelligence tools have the potential to objectively identify youth in need of mental health care. Speech signals have shown promise as a source for predicting various psychiatric conditions and transdiagnostic symptoms.\nWe designed a study testing the association between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) diagnosis and symptom severity on vocal features in children and adolescents. Here, we present an analysis plan and statistical report for the study to document our a priori hypotheses and increase the robustness of the findings of our planned study.\nAudio recordings of clinical interviews of 47 children and adolescents with OCD and 17 children and adolescents without a psychiatric diagnosis will be analyzed. Youths were between 8 and 17 years old. We will test the effect of OCD diagnosis on computationally derived scores of vocal activation using ANOVA. To test the effect of OCD severity classifications on the same computationally derived vocal scores, we will perform a logistic regression. Finally, we will attempt to create an improved indicator of OCD severity by refining the model with more relevant labels. Models will be adjusted for age and gender. Model validation strategies are outlined.\nSimulated results are presented. The actual results using real data will be presented in future publications.\nA major strength of this study is that we will include age and gender in our models to increase classification accuracy. A major challenge is the suboptimal quality of the audio recordings, which are representative of in-the-wild data and a large body of recordings collected during other clinical trials. This preregistered analysis plan and statistical report will increase the validity of the interpretations of the upcoming results.\nDERR1-10.2196/39613.", "The Internet of Things (IoT) devices generate a large amount of data over networks; therefore, the efficiency, complexity, interfaces, dynamics, robustness, and interaction need to be re-examined on a large scale. This phenomenon will lead to seamless network connectivity and the capability to provide support for the IoT. The traditional IoT is not enough to provide support. Therefore, we designed this study to provide a systematic analysis of next-generation advancements in the IoT. We propose a systematic catalog that covers the most recent advances in the traditional IoT. An overview of the IoT from the perspectives of big data, data science, and network science disciplines and also connecting technologies is given. We highlight the conceptual view of the IoT, key concepts, growth, and most recent trends. We discuss and highlight the importance and the integration of big data, data science, and network science along with key applications such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, federated learning, etc. Finally, we discuss various challenges and issues of IoT such as architecture, integration, data provenance, and important applications such as cloud and edge computing, etc. This article will provide aid to the readers and other researchers in an understanding of the IoT's next-generation developments and tell how they apply to the real world.", "Tremor is one of the common symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thanks to the recent evolution of digital technologies, monitoring of PD patients' hand movements employing contactless methods gained momentum. Objective: We aimed to quantitatively assess hand movements in patients suffering from PD using the artificial intelligence (AI)-based hand-tracking technologies of MediaPipe. Method: High-frame-rate videos and accelerometer data were recorded from 11 PD patients, two of whom showed classical Parkinsonian-type tremor. In the OFF-state and 30 Minutes after taking their standard oral medication (ON-state), video recordings were obtained. First, we investigated the frequency and amplitude relationship between the video and accelerometer data. Then, we focused on quantifying the effect of taking standard oral treatments. Results: The data extracted from the video correlated well with the accelerometer-based measurement system. Our video-based approach identified the tremor frequency with a small error rate (mean absolute error 0.229 (\u00b10.174) Hz) and an amplitude with a high correlation. The frequency and amplitude of the hand movement before and after medication in PD patients undergoing medication differ. PD Patients experienced a decrease in the mean value for frequency from 2.012 (\u00b11.385) Hz to 1.526 (\u00b11.007) Hz and in the mean value for amplitude from 8.167 (\u00b115.687) a.u. to 4.033 (\u00b15.671) a.u. Conclusions: Our work achieved an automatic estimation of the movement frequency, including the tremor frequency with a low error rate, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that presents automated tremor analysis before/after medication in PD, in particular using high-frame-rate video data.", "The exponential increase in internet data poses several challenges to cloud systems and data centers, such as scalability, power overheads, network load, and data security. To overcome these limitations, research is focusing on the development of edge computing systems, i.e., based on a distributed computing model in which data processing occurs as close as possible to where the data are collected. Edge computing, indeed, mitigates the limitations of cloud computing, implementing artificial intelligence algorithms directly on the embedded devices enabling low latency responses without network overhead or high costs, and improving solution scalability. Today, the hardware improvements of the edge devices make them capable of performing, even if with some constraints, complex computations, such as those required by Deep Neural Networks. Nevertheless, to efficiently implement deep learning algorithms on devices with limited computing power, it is necessary to minimize the production time and to quickly identify, deploy, and, if necessary, optimize the best Neural Network solution. This study focuses on developing a universal method to identify and port the best Neural Network on an edge system, valid regardless of the device, Neural Network, and task typology. The method is based on three steps: a trade-off step to obtain the best Neural Network within different solutions under investigation; an optimization step to find the best configurations of parameters under different acceleration techniques; eventually, an explainability step using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), which provides a global approach to quantify the goodness of the classifier decision criteria. We evaluated several MobileNets on the Fudan Shangai-Tech dataset to test the proposed approach.", "Adolescents spend a large percentage of their time at school, where learning and achievement are important activities that are vital to their future educational success and subsequent career opportunities. However, studies reveal a significant drop in satisfaction and performance during the teenage years.\nBased on the ecological model, this study aims to explore the relationship dynamics between contextual (school climate) and psychological (emotional intelligence and resilience) variables, life satisfaction and perceived academic performance, analysing, to this end, four theoretical models grounded in previous research.\nThe sample comprised a total of 1397 adolescents aged between 12 and 16\u2009years from the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (northern Spain).\nThe Equations 6.2 program was used to estimate the measurement model and the structural models, using the robust maximum likelihood procedure.\nSchool climate and life satisfaction were found to directly influence perceived academic performance, whereas emotional intelligence and resilience did so indirectly, with the full mediation of life satisfaction.\nThese results have important educational implications, since they reveal existing relationship dynamics, which should serve as a basis for the effective implementation of school programs. They also indicate how important it is for adolescents to be psychologically well-adjusted and satisfied with their lives, in order for them to perform optimally at school.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) development imitates the workings of the human brain to comprehend modern problems. The traditional approaches such as high throughput screening (HTS) and combinatorial chemistry are lengthy and expensive to the pharmaceutical industry as they can only handle a smaller dataset. Deep learning (DL) is a sophisticated AI method that uses a thorough comprehension of particular systems. The pharmaceutical industry is now adopting DL techniques to enhance the research and development process. Multi-oriented algorithms play a crucial role in the processing of QSAR analysis, de novo drug design, ADME evaluation, physicochemical analysis, preclinical development, followed by clinical trial data precision. In this study, we investigated the performance of several algorithms, including deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multi-task learning (MTL), with the aim of generating high-quality, interpretable big and diverse databases for drug design and development. Studies have demonstrated that CNN, recurrent neural network and deep belief network are compatible, accurate and effective for the molecular description of pharmacodynamic properties. In Covid-19, existing pharmacological compounds has also been repurposed using DL models. In the absence of the Covid-19 vaccine, remdesivir and oseltamivir have been widely employed to treat severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. In conclusion, the results indicate the potential benefits of employing the DL strategies in the drug discovery process.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of theories and techniques in which machines are used to simulate human intelligence with complex computer programs. The various machine learning (ML) methods are a subtype of AI. They originate from computer science and use algorithms established from analyzing a database to accomplish certain tasks. Among these methods are decision trees or random forests, support vector machines along with artificial neural networks. Convolutive neural networks were inspired from the visual cortex; they process combinations of information used in image or voice recognition. Deep learning (DL) groups together a set of ML methods and is useful for modeling complex relationships with a high degree of abstraction by using multiple layers of artificial neurons. ML techniques have a growing role in spine surgery. The main applications are the segmentation of intraoperative images for surgical navigation or robotics used for pedicle screw placement, the interpretation of images of intervertebral discs or full spine radiographs, which can be automated using ML algorithms. ML techniques can also be used as aids for surgical decision-making in complex fields, such as preoperative evaluation of adult spinal deformity. ML algorithms \"learn\" from large clinical databases. They make it possible to establish the intraoperative risk level and make a prognosis on how the postoperative functional scores will change over time as a function of the patient profile. These applications open a new path relative to standard statistical analyses. They make it possible to explore more complex relationships with multiple indirect interactions. In the future, AI algorithms could have a greater role in clinical research, evaluating clinical and surgical practices, and conducting health economics analyses.", "Transformers play an essential role in power networks, ensuring that generated power gets to consumers at the safest voltage level. However, they are prone to insulation failure from ageing, which has fatal and economic consequences if left undetected or unattended. Traditional detection methods are based on scheduled maintenance practices that often involve taking samples from in situ transformers and analysing them in laboratories using several techniques. This conventional method exposes the engineer performing the test to hazards, requires specialised training, and does not guarantee reliable results because samples can be contaminated during collection and transportation. This paper reviews the transformer oil types and some traditional ageing detection methods, including breakdown voltage (BDV), spectroscopy, dissolved gas analysis, total acid number, interfacial tension, and corresponding regulating standards. In addition, a review of sensors, technologies to improve the reliability of online ageing detection, and related online transformer ageing systems is covered in this work. A non-destructive online ageing detection method for in situ transformer oil is a better alternative to the traditional offline detection method. Moreover, when combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence, a prescriptive maintenance solution emerges, offering more advantages and robustness than offline preventive maintenance approaches.", "Data-driven technologies for education, such as artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) systems, learning analytics dashboards, open learner models, and other applications, are often created with an aspiration to help teachers make better, evidence-informed decisions in the classroom. Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies.", "Artificial neural networks based on crossbar arrays of analog programmable resistors can address the high energy challenge of conventional hardware in artificial intelligence applications. However, state-of-the-art two-terminal resistive switching devices based on conductive filament formation suffer from high variability and poor controllability. Electrochemical ionic synapses are three-terminal devices that operate by electrochemical and dynamic insertion/extraction of ions that control the electronic conductivity of a channel in a single solid-solution phase. They are promising candidates for programmable resistors in crossbar arrays because they have shown uniform and deterministic control of electronic conductivity based on ion doping, with very low energy consumption. Here, the desirable specifications of these programmable resistors are presented. Then, an overview of the current progress of devices based on Li+ , O2- , and H+ ions and material systems is provided. Achieving nanosecond speed, low operation voltage (\u22481\u00a0V), low energy consumption, with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatibility all simultaneously remains a challenge. Toward this goal, a physical model of the device is constructed to provide guidelines for the desired material properties to overcome the remaining challenges. Finally, an outlook is provided, including strategies to advance materials toward the desirable properties and the future opportunities for electrochemical ionic synapses.", "Purpose: To establish reporting adherence to the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) in diagnostic accuracy AI studies with the highest Altmetric Attention Scores (AAS), and to compare completeness of reporting between peer-reviewed manuscripts and preprints. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv were retrospectively searched for 100 diagnostic accuracy medical imaging AI studies in peer-reviewed journals and preprint platforms with the highest AAS since the release of CLAIM to June 24, 2021. Studies were evaluated for adherence to the 42-item CLAIM checklist with comparison between peer-reviewed manuscripts and preprints. The impact of additional factors was explored including body region, models on COVID-19 diagnosis and journal impact factor. Results: Median CLAIM adherence was 48% (20/42). The median CLAIM score of manuscripts published in peer-reviewed journals was higher than preprints, 57% (24/42) vs 40% (16/42), P < .0001. Chest radiology was the body region with the least complete reporting (P = .0352), with manuscripts on COVID-19 less complete than others (43% vs 54%, P = .0002). For studies published in peer-reviewed journals with an impact factor, the CLAIM score correlated with impact factor, rho = 0.43, P = .0040. Completeness of reporting based on CLAIM score had a positive correlation with a study's AAS, rho = 0.68, P < .0001. Conclusions: Overall reporting adherence to CLAIM is low in imaging diagnostic accuracy AI studies with the highest AAS, with preprints reporting fewer study details than peer-reviewed manuscripts. Improved CLAIM adherence could promote adoption of AI into clinical practice and facilitate investigators building upon prior works.", "In recent years, vital signals monitoring in sports and health have been considered the research focus in the field of wearable sensing technologies. Typical signals include bioelectrical signals, biophysical signals, and biochemical signals, which have applications in the fields of athletic training, medical diagnosis and prevention, and rehabilitation. In particular, since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in real-time interest in personal health. This has created an urgent need for flexible, wearable, portable, and real-time monitoring sensors to remotely monitor these signals in response to health management. To this end, the paper reviews recent advances in flexible wearable sensors for monitoring vital signals in sports and health. More precisely, emerging wearable devices and systems for health and exercise-related vital signals (e.g., ECG, EEG, EMG, inertia, body movements, heart rate, blood, sweat, and interstitial fluid) are reviewed first. Then, the paper creatively presents multidimensional and multimodal wearable sensors and systems. The paper also summarizes the current challenges and limitations and future directions of wearable sensors for vital typical signal detection. Through the review, the paper finds that these signals can be effectively monitored and used for health management (e.g., disease prediction) thanks to advanced manufacturing, flexible electronics, IoT, and artificial intelligence algorithms; however, wearable sensors and systems with multidimensional and multimodal are more compliant.", "Natural intelligence has many dimensions, with some of its most important manifestations being tied to learning about the environment and making behavioral changes. In primates, vision plays a critical role in learning. The underlying biological neural networks contain specialized neurons and synapses which not only sense and process visual stimuli but also learn and adapt with remarkable energy efficiency. Forgetting also plays an active role in learning. Mimicking the adaptive neurobiological mechanisms for seeing, learning, and forgetting can, therefore, accelerate the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and bridge the massive energy gap that exists between AI and biological intelligence. Here, we demonstrate a bioinspired machine vision system based on a 2D phototransistor array fabricated from large-area monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and integrated with an analog, nonvolatile, and programmable memory gate-stack; this architecture not only enables dynamic learning and relearning from visual stimuli but also offers learning adaptability under noisy illumination conditions at miniscule energy expenditure. In short, our demonstrated \"all-in-one\" hardware vision platform combines \"sensing\", \"computing\", and \"storage\" to not only overcome the von Neumann bottleneck of conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology but also to eliminate the need for peripheral circuits and sensors.", "The study examines the psychometric properties of the adapted Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale (A-SEIS) with 200 undergraduate students at the Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). Upon the permission, the researchers adapted the original instrument, SEIS by incorporating a new construct which is understanding of emotions and some ability-based items into the perceived emotions construct. The A-SEIS is a mixed (trait and ability) measure EI instrument that aims at assessing four important dimensions of EI, including perception of emotions, utilization of emotions, understanding of emotions, and management of emotions. The study investigated the content validity of the A-SEIS by using the content validity indexing (CVI). Three expert panels translated and back-translated the A-SEIS and rated the degree of relevance of every item based on the four-point scale provided in the content validation form. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) methods were used to explore the underlying structure of the A-SEIS. The general validity testing of the adapted instrument was carried out in the framework of the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach by applying two iterations of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the first approach is the covariance-based SEM (CB-SEM) approach, followed by the partial least squares based SEM (PLS-SEM) using two different software: AMOS and smartPLS. Research findings concluded that the instrument is reliable and valid to be applied in tertiary education settings and future research.", "Zoonotic diseases or zoonoses are infections due to the natural transmission of pathogens between species (animals and humans). More than 70% of emerging infectious diseases are attributed to animal origin. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have been used for studying zoonotic pathogens and the factors that contribute to their spread. The aim of this literature survey is to synthesize and analyze machine learning, and deep learning approaches applied to study zoonotic diseases to understand predictive models to help researchers identify the risk factors, and develop mitigation strategies. Based on our survey findings, machine learning and deep learning are commonly used for the prediction of both foodborne and zoonotic pathogens as well as the factors associated with the presence of the pathogens.", "Educational quality may be a closer correlate of physical health than more commonly used measures of educational attainment (e.g., years in school). We examined whether a widely-used performance-based measure of educational quality is more closely associated with cardiometabolic health than educational attainment (highest level of education completed), and whether perceived control (smaller sample only), executive functioning (both samples), and health literacy (smaller sample only) link educational quality to cardiometabolic health. In two samples (N\u2009=\u200998 and N\u2009=\u2009586) collected from different regions of the US, educational quality was associated with cardiometabolic health above and beyond educational attainment, other demographic factors (age, ethnoracial category, sex), and fluid intelligence. Counter to expectations, neither perceived control, executive function, nor health literacy significantly mediated the association between educational quality and cardiometabolic health. Findings add to the growing literature suggesting that current operationalizations of the construct of education likely underestimate the association between education and multiple forms of health. To the extent that educational programs may have been overlooked based on the apparent size of associations with outcomes, such actions may have been premature.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied successfully in many real-life domains for solving complex problems. With the invention of Machine Learning (ML) paradigms, it becomes convenient for researchers to predict the outcome based on past data. Nowadays, ML is acting as the biggest weapon against the COVID-19 pandemic by detecting symptomatic cases at an early stage and warning people about its futuristic effects. It is observed that COVID-19 has blown out globally so much in a short period because of the shortage of testing facilities and delays in test reports. To address this challenge, AI can be effectively applied to produce fast as well as cost-effective solutions. Plenty of researchers come up with AI-based solutions for preliminary diagnosis using chest CT Images, respiratory sound analysis, voice analysis of symptomatic persons with asymptomatic ones, and so forth. Some AI-based applications claim good accuracy in predicting the chances of being COVID-19-positive. Within a short period, plenty of research work is published regarding the identification of COVID-19. This paper has carefully examined and presented a comprehensive survey of more than 110 papers that came from various reputed sources, that is, Springer, IEEE, Elsevier, MDPI, arXiv, and medRxiv. Most of the papers selected for this survey presented candid work to detect and classify COVID-19, using deep-learning-based models from chest X-Rays and CT scan images. We hope that this survey covers most of the work and provides insights to the research community in proposing efficient as well as accurate solutions for fighting the pandemic.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis and treatment could expand the medical scenarios and augment work efficiency and accuracy. However, factors influencing healthcare workers' adoption intention of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment are not well-understood. This study conducted a cross-sectional study of 343 dental healthcare workers from tertiary hospitals and secondary hospitals in Anhui Province. The obtained data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results showed that performance expectancy and effort expectancy were both positively related to healthcare workers' adoption intention of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment. Social influence and human-computer trust, respectively, mediated the relationship between expectancy (performance expectancy and effort expectancy) and healthcare workers' adoption intention of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, social influence and human-computer trust played a chain mediation role between expectancy and healthcare workers' adoption intention of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment. Our study provided novel insights into the path mechanism of healthcare workers' adoption intention of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment.", "To clarify the views of the general population of two countries (US and Japan), concerning handling of their medical records electronically, disclosure of the name of disease, secondary usage of information, compiling their records into a lifelong medical record, access to their medical records on the internet, questionnaire filling for delicate history, comprehensive consent for laboratory results, chart and genome profile, and AI use in diagnosis and explanation.\nThe authors contacted people nationwide in the United States at random via Random Digit Dialing (RDD) in 2008. Same questionnaire plus some new items were surveyed in 2022 by mail invited web entry. The authors had also surveyed people in Japan in 2007 and 2017 using same questionnaires sent by mail.\nIn US, accessing own chart by internet became accepted (positive 52% to 61%) and popular in these 14 years. Japan showed small change, as regional medical record sharing is yet to come. About medical records in un-identifiable manner to be used for the purpose of medical error precautions, infectious disease measures and device/drug developments, in US, positive answers are constantly low, even for infectious disease prevention like CoVID-19. About preference to compile medical record into one file as a lifelong medical record, sharp contrast was observed. US people became favor of lifelong record (46% to 71%), while Japanese people decreased (76% to 57%). As for comprehensive consent, Japan positive answers are more than US for all situations, except if genome profile is included. US answers are almost same, even genome profile is included. About AI (artificial intelligence) application to healthcare, both US and Japan survey showed best preferred is \"Doctor may use AI and everything, and explains in person\". Japanese people largely prefer explanation in person, while US showed small preference.", "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a component of neural tissue. Because its accretion into the brain is greatest during the final trimester of pregnancy, infants born before 29 weeks' gestation do not receive the normal supply of DHA. The effect of this deficiency on subsequent cognitive development is not well understood.\nWe assessed general intelligence at 5 years in children who had been enrolled in a trial of neonatal DHA supplementation to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In the previous trial, infants born before 29 weeks' gestation had been randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive an enteral emulsion that provided 60 mg of DHA per kilogram of body weight per day or a control emulsion from the first 3 days of enteral feeds until 36 weeks of postmenstrual age or discharge home, whichever occurred first. Children from 5 of the 13 centers in the original trial were invited to undergo assessment with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) at 5 years of corrected age. The primary outcome was the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) score. Secondary outcomes included the components of WPPSI.\nA total of 1273 infants underwent randomization in the original trial; of the 656 surviving children who had undergone randomization at the centers included in this follow-up study, 480 (73%) had an FSIQ score available - 241 in the DHA group and 239 in the control group. After imputation of missing data, the mean (\u00b1SD) FSIQ scores were 95.4\u00b117.3 in the DHA group and 91.9\u00b119.1 in the control group (adjusted difference, 3.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.38 to 6.53; P\u2009=\u20090.03). The results for secondary outcomes generally did not support that obtained for the primary outcome. Adverse events were similar in the two groups.\nIn infants born before 29 weeks' gestation who had been enrolled in a trial to assess the effect of DHA supplementation on bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the use of an enteral DHA emulsion until 36 weeks of postmenstrual age was associated with modestly higher FSIQ scores at 5 years of age than control feeding.

However, they were not informed that emergency departments (EDs) were safe. Reports from the National Ambulance Services showed a 22% increase in at-home deaths during the lockdown. Perhaps, the reason is because some critically ill patients postponed referrals and came \"at the last minute\". After the first lockdown, the Ministry of Health (MOH) declared that hospital EDs were safe. The objective of the study was to examine the rates of admission from EDs to hospital wards, and non-COVID-19 in-hospital deaths during the first lockdown in Israel, compared with the second and third lockdowns. From the business intelligence software of the Rambam Medical Center in Israel, we collected data about the rates of admission to the ED, the non-COVID-19 in-hospital deaths during the three lockdowns, during the same periods in the previous three years, and the main five causes of non-COVID-19 deaths. Data comparison was done using multiple chi-square tests. ED admission numbers were significantly higher during the first lockdown than during the second (\u03c72 (1, n = 36,245) = 24.774, p = 0.00001) and third lockdowns (\u03c72 (1, n = 36,547) = 8.7808, p = 0.0030). We found a significantly higher number of non-COVID-19 in-hospital deaths vs. discharges during the first lockdown than in the second and third lockdowns (\u03c72 (2, n = 26,268) = 7.794, p = 0.0203) The number of deaths due to respiratory diseases was significantly higher during the first lockdown than in the second lockdown (\u03c72 (1, n = 572) = 8.8185, p = 0.0029) and in the third lockdown (\u03c72 (1, n = 624) = 9.0381, p = 0.0026), and deaths from infectious diseases were higher during the first lockdown than during both the second and third lockdowns (\u03c72 (1, n = 566) = 5.9479, p = 0.0147, and \u03c72 (1, n = 624) = 9.5978, p = 0.0019), respectively. The onset of CVA and CVD are abrupt, while respiratory and infectious diseases may have an insidious pattern; this may have led patients to postpone referrals to hospitals to the \"last minute\" during the first lockdown, perhaps due to fears of contracting COVID-19, and as a result of vague instructions. Citizens and policymakers must be made aware of this point during future pandemics.", "Modern technology has made an elegant link between smart materials and interlinked devices thanks to the interplay between materials science, smart sensors and devices, artificial intelligence, and a fierce imagination; this has allowed us to reach every corner of our society [...].", "Light-stimulated synaptic devices are promising candidates for the development of artificial intelligence systems because of their unique properties, which include broad bandwidths, low power consumption, and superior parallelism. The key to develop such devices is the realization of photoelectric synaptic behavior in them. In this work, visible-light-stimulated synaptic transistors based on CdSe quantum dot (CdSe QD)/amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O hybrid channels are proposed. This design can not only improve the charge separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers, but also can induce delayed decay of the photocurrent. The improved charge separation efficiency enhances the photoelectric properties significantly, while the delayed decay of the photocurrent led to the realization of photoelectric synaptic behaviors. This simple and efficient method of fabricating light-stimulated phototransistors may inspire new research progress into the development of artificial intelligence systems.", "Cancer treatment and pharmaceutical development require targeted treatment and less toxic therapeutic intervention to achieve real progress against this disease. In this scenario, nanomedicine emerged as a reliable tool to improve drug pharmacokinetics and to translate to the clinical biologics based on large molecules. However, the ability of our body to recognize foreign objects together with carrier transport heterogeneity derived from the combination of particle physical and chemical properties, payload and surface modification, make the designing of effective carriers very difficult. In this scenario, physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling can help to design the particles and eventually predict their ability to reach the target and treat the tumor. This effort is performed by scientists with specific expertise and skills and familiarity with artificial intelligence tools such as advanced software that are not usually in the \"cords\" of traditional medical or material researchers. The goal of this review was to highlight the advantages that computational modeling could provide to nanomedicine and bring together scientists with different background by portraying in the most simple way the work of computational developers through the description of the tools that they use to predict nanoparticle transport and tumor targeting in our body.", "The unprecedented scale of the current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has led to an extensive-yet fragmented-assessment of its endocrine repercussions; in many reports, the endocrine aspects of COVID-19 are lumped together in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and non-ICU patients. In this brief review, we aimed to present endocrine alterations in ICU-hospitalized patients with COVID-19. There are tangible endocrine disturbances that may provide fertile ground for COVID-19, such as preexisting diabetes. Other endocrine disturbances accompany the disease and more particularly its severe forms. Up to the time of writing, no isolated robust endocrine/hormonal biomarkers for the prognosis of COVID-19 have been presented. Among those which may be easily available are admission glycemia, thyroid hormones, and maybe (OH)25-vitamin D3. Their overlap among patients with severe and less severe forms of COVID-19 may be considerable, so their levels may be indicative only. We have shown that insulin-like growth factor 1 may have prognostic value, but this is not a routine measurement. Possibly, as our current knowledge is expanding, the inclusion of selected routine endocrine/hormonal measurements into artificial intelligence/machine learning models may provide further information.", "Background: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of regional graders and artificial intelligence algorithms across retinal cameras with different specifications in classifying an image as gradable and ungradable. Methods: Study subjects were included from a community-based nationwide diabetic retinopathy screening program in Thailand. Various non-mydriatic fundus cameras were used for image acquisition, including Kowa Nonmyd, Kowa Nonmyd \u03b1-D\u2162, Kowa Nonmyd 7, Kowa Nonmyd WX, Kowa VX 10 \u03b1, Kowa VX 20 and Nidek AFC 210. All retinal photographs were graded by deep learning algorithms and human graders and compared with a standard reference. Results: Images were divided into two categories as gradable and ungradable images. Four thousand eight hundred fifty-two participants with 19,408 fundus images were included, of which 15,351 (79.09%) were gradable images and the remaining 4057 (20.90%) were ungradable images. Conclusions: The deep learning (DL) algorithm demonstrated better sensitivity, specificity and kappa than the human graders for all eight types of non-mydriatic fundus cameras. The deep learning system showed, more consistent diagnostic performance than the human graders across images of varying quality and camera types.", "Human ideas and sentiments are mirrored in facial expressions. They give the spectator a plethora of social cues, such as the viewer's focus of attention, intention, motivation, and mood, which can help develop better interactive solutions in online platforms. This could be helpful for children while teaching them, which could help in cultivating a better interactive connect between teachers and students, since there is an increasing trend toward the online education platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To solve this, the authors proposed kids' emotion recognition based on visual cues in this research with a justified reasoning model of explainable AI. The authors used two datasets to work on this problem; the first is the LIRIS Children Spontaneous Facial Expression Video Database, and the second is an author-created novel dataset of emotions displayed by children aged 7 to 10. The authors identified that the LIRIS dataset has achieved only 75% accuracy, and no study has worked further on this dataset in which the authors have achieved the highest accuracy of 89.31% and, in the authors' dataset, an accuracy of 90.98%. The authors also realized that the face construction of children and adults is different, and the way children show emotions is very different and does not always follow the same way of facial expression for a specific emotion as compared with adults. Hence, the authors used 3D 468 landmark points and created two separate versions of the dataset from the original selected datasets, which are LIRIS-Mesh and Authors-Mesh. In total, all four types of datasets were used, namely LIRIS, the authors' dataset, LIRIS-Mesh, and Authors-Mesh, and a comparative analysis was performed by using seven different CNN models. The authors not only compared all dataset types used on different CNN models but also explained for every type of CNN used on every specific dataset type how test images are perceived by the deep-learning models by using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which helps in localizing features contributing to particular emotions. The authors used three methods of XAI, namely Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and SoftGrad, which help users further establish the appropriate reason for emotion detection by knowing the contribution of its features in it.", "Artificial intelligence was born to allow computers to learn and control their environment, trying to imitate the human brain structure by simulating its biological evolution. Artificial intelligence makes it possible to analyze large amounts of data (big data) in real-time, providing forecasts that can support the clinician's decisions. This scenario can include diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment in anesthesiology, intensive care medicine, and pain medicine. Machine Learning is a subcategory of AI. It is based on algorithms trained for decisions making that automatically learn and recognize patterns from data. This article aims to offer an overview of the potential application of AI in anesthesiology and analyzes the operating principles of machine learning Every Machine Learning pathway starts from task definition and ends in model application.\nHigh-performance characteristics and strict quality controls are needed during its progress. During this process, different measures can be identified (pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, model processing and evaluation). For inexperienced operators, the process can be facilitated by ad hoc tools for data engineering, machine learning, and analytics.", "Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) is a rapid non-invasive in vivo ophthalmic imaging technique that images the cornea. Historically, it was utilised in the diagnosis and clinical management of corneal epithelial and stromal disorders. However, over the past 20 years, CCM has been increasingly used to image sub-basal small nerve fibres in a variety of peripheral neuropathies and central neurodegenerative diseases. CCM has been used to identify subclinical nerve damage and to predict the development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). The complex structure of the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus can be readily analysed through nerve segmentation with manual or automated quantification of parameters such as corneal nerve fibre length (CNFL), nerve fibre density (CNFD), and nerve branch density (CNBD). Large quantities of 2D corneal nerve images lend themselves to the application of artificial intelligence (AI)-based deep learning algorithms (DLA). Indeed, DLA have demonstrated performance comparable to manual but superior to automated quantification of corneal nerve morphology. Recently, our end-to-end classification with a 3 class AI model demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating healthy volunteers from people with and without peripheral neuropathy. We believe there is significant scope and need to apply AI to help differentiate between peripheral neuropathies and also central neurodegenerative disorders. AI has significant potential to enhance the diagnostic and prognostic utility of CCM in the management of both peripheral and central neurodegenerative diseases.", "Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) reading is a time- and energy-consuming task. Agreement on findings between readers (either different or the same) is a crucial point for increasing performance and providing valid reports. The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis is to provide an evaluation of inter/intra-observer agreement in VCE reading. A systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science was performed throughout September 2022. The degree of observer agreement, expressed with different test statistics, was extracted. As different statistics are not directly comparable, our analyses were stratified by type of test statistics, dividing them in groups of \"None/Poor/Minimal\", \"Moderate/Weak/Fair\", \"Good/Excellent/Strong\" and \"Perfect/Almost perfect\" to report the proportions of each. In total, 60 studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 579 comparisons. The quality of included studies, assessed with the MINORS score, was sufficient in 52/60 studies. The most common test statistics were the Kappa statistics for categorical outcomes (424 comparisons) and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for continuous outcomes (73 comparisons). In the overall comparison of inter-observer agreement, only 23% were evaluated as \"good\" or \"perfect\"; for intra-observer agreement, this was the case in 36%. Sources of heterogeneity (high, I2 81.8-98.1%) were investigated with meta-regressions, showing a possible role of country, capsule type and year of publication in Kappa inter-observer agreement. VCE reading suffers from substantial heterogeneity and sub-optimal agreement in both inter- and intra-observer evaluation. Artificial-intelligence-based tools and the adoption of a unified terminology may progressively enhance levels of agreement in VCE reading.", "An unhealthy diet is strongly linked to obesity and numerous chronic diseases. Currently, over two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese. Although dietary assessment helps people improve nutrition and lifestyle, traditional methods for dietary assessment depend on self-report, which is inaccurate and often biased. In recent years, as electronics, information, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies advanced rapidly, image-based objective dietary assessment using wearable electronic devices has become a powerful approach. However, research in this field has been focused on the developments of advanced algorithms to process image data. Few reports exist on the study of device hardware for the particular purpose of dietary assessment. In this work, we demonstrate that, with the current hardware design, there is a considerable risk of missing important dietary data owing to the common use of rectangular image screen and fixed camera orientation. We then present two designs of a new camera system to reduce data loss by generating circular images using rectangular image sensor chips. We also present a mechanical design that allows the camera orientation to be adjusted, adapting to differences among device wearers, such as gender, body height, and so on. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of rectangular versus circular images with respect to information preservation and data processing using AI algorithms.", "To quickly and accurately identify the pathological features of the tongue, we developed an intelligent tongue diagnosis system that uses deep learning on a mobile terminal. We also propose an efficient and accurate tongue image processing algorithm framework to infer the category of the tongue. First, a software system integrating registration, login, account management, tongue image recognition, and doctor-patient dialogue was developed based on the Android platform. Then, the deep learning models, based on the official benchmark models, were trained by using the tongue image datasets. The tongue diagnosis algorithm framework includes the YOLOv5s6, U-Net, and MobileNetV3 networks, which are employed for tongue recognition, tongue region segmentation, and tongue feature classification (tooth marks, spots, and fissures), respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the tongue diagnosis model was satisfying, and the accuracy of the final classification of tooth marks, spots, and fissures was 93.33%, 89.60%, and 97.67%, respectively. The construction of this system has a certain reference value for the objectification and intelligence of tongue diagnosis.", "Despite the availability of commercial artificial intelligence (AI) tools for large vessel occlusion (LVO) detection, there is paucity of data comparing traditional machine learning and deep learning solutions in a real-world setting. The purpose of this study is to compare and validate the performance of two AI-based tools (RAPID LVO and CINA LVO) for LVO detection.\nThis was a retrospective, single center study performed at a comprehensive stroke center from December 2020 to June 2021. CT angiography (n = 263) for suspected stroke were evaluated for LVO. RAPID LVO is a traditional machine learning model which primarily relies on vessel density threshold assessment, while CINA LVO is an end-to-end deep learning tool implemented with multiple neural networks for detection and localization tasks. Reasons for errors were also recorded.\nThere were 29 positive and 224 negative LVO cases by ground truth assessment. RAPID LVO demonstrated an accuracy of 0.86, sensitivity of 0.90, specificity of 0.86, positive predictive value of 0.45, and negative predictive value of 0.98, while CINA demonstrated an accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.76, specificity of 0.98, positive predictive value of 0.85, and negative predictive value of 0.97.\nBoth tools successfully detected most anterior circulation occlusions. RAPID LVO had higher sensitivity while CINA LVO had higher accuracy and specificity. Interestingly, both tools were able to detect some, but not all M2 MCA occlusions. This is the first study to compare traditional and deep learning LVO tools in the clinical setting.", "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which infects more than 23% of the world's population. With the emergence of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) and latent TB infection (LTBI), rapid diagnosis of DR-TB and LTBI has become a challenge for the prevention and control of TB. Herein, we highlight these challenges and discuss emerging clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based diagnostics in TB detection. Currently, the clinical diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection mainly depends on pathogenic and molecular biological methods, including sputum smear, sputum culture, and Xpert. Although CRISPR-based diagnostics have not been applied to the clinical diagnosis of TB, they have shown exciting preponderances in TB diagnosis compared with traditional methods, including higher sensitivity, less sample input, and shorter turnaround time. CRISPR-based diagnostics represent a potential tool to address the challenges and natural weaknesses associated with traditional TB diagnosis methods. Based on the currently available data, we suggest that future CRISPR-based TB diagnostics should be developed in the direction of automation, modularization, diversification, and intelligence. By combining the CRISPR platform with various systems, such as microfluidic chips, droplet microfluidics, electrochemical techniques, and optical systems, the specificity and sensitivity of TB diagnosis may be revolutionized.", "Intellectual disability is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a related co-occurrence of mental health issues and challenging behaviors. In addition to purely cognitive functions, socio-emotional competencies may also be affected. In this paper, the lens of developmental social neuroscience is used to better understand the origins of mental disorders and challenging behaviors in people with an intellectual disability. The current concept of intelligence is broadened by socio-emotional brain functions. The emergence of these socio-emotional brain functions is linked to the formation of the respective neuronal networks located within the different parts of the limbic system. Thus, high order networks build on circuits that process more basic information. The socio-emotional skills can be assessed and complement the results of a standardized IQ-test. Disturbances of the brain cytoarchitecture and function that occur at a certain developmental period may increase the susceptibility to certain mental disorders. Insights into the current mental and socio-emotional functioning of a person may support clinicians in the calibration of treatment and support. Acknowledging the trajectories of the socio-emotional brain development may result in a more comprehensive understanding of behaviors and mental health in people with developmental delays and thus underpin supports for promotion of good mental health in this highly vulnerable population.", "Internet of Things (IoT)-backed smart shopping carts are generating an extensive amount of data in shopping markets around the world. This data can be cleaned and utilized for setting business goals and strategies. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are used to efficiently extract meaningful patterns or insights from such huge amounts of data or big data. One such technique is Association Rule Mining (ARM) which is used to extract strategic information from the data. The crucial step in ARM is Frequent Itemsets Mining (FIM) followed by association rule generation. The FIM process starts by tuning the support threshold parameter from the user to produce the number of required frequent patterns. To perform the FIM process, the user applies hit and trial methods to rerun the aforesaid routine in order to receive the required number of patterns. The research community has shifted its focus towards the development of top-K most frequent patterns not using the support threshold parameter tuned by the user. Top-K most frequent patterns mining is considered a harder task than user-tuned support-threshold-based FIM. One of the reasons why top-K most frequent patterns mining techniques are computationally intensive is the fact that they produce a large number of candidate itemsets. These methods also do not use any explicit pruning mechanism apart from the internally auto-maintained support threshold parameter. Therefore, we propose an efficient TKIFIs Miner algorithm that uses depth-first search strategy for top-K identical frequent patterns mining. The TKIFIs Miner uses specialized one- and two-itemsets-based pruning techniques for topmost patterns mining. Comparative analysis is performed on special benchmark datasets, for example, Retail with 16,469 items, T40I10D100K and T10I4D100K with 1000 items each, etc. The evaluation results have proven that the TKIFIs Miner is at the top of the line, compared to recently available topmost patterns mining methods not using the support threshold parameter.", "Phenaloenones are structurally unique aromatic polyketides that have been reported in both microbial and plant sources. They possess a hydroxy perinaphthenone three-fused-ring system and exhibit diverse bioactivities, such as cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-HIV properties, and tyrosinase, \u03b1-glucosidase, lipase, AchE (acetylcholinesterase), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, angiotensin-I-converting enzyme, and tyrosine phosphatase inhibition. Moreover, they have a rich nucleophilic nucleus that has inspired many chemists and biologists to synthesize more of these related derivatives. The current review provides an overview of the reported phenalenones with a fungal origin, including their structures, sources, biosynthesis, and bioactivities. Moreover, more than 135 metabolites have been listed, and 71 references have been cited. SuperPred, an artificial intelligence (AI) webserver, was used to predict the potential targets for selected phenalenones. Among these targets, we chose human glucose transporter 1 (hGLUT1) for an extensive in silico study, as it shows high probability and model accuracy. Among them, aspergillussanones C (60) and G (60) possessed the highest negative docking scores of -15.082 and -14.829 kcal/mol, respectively, compared to the native inhibitor of 5RE (score: -11.206 kcal/mol). The MD (molecular dynamics) simulation revealed their stability in complexes with GLUT1 at 100 ns. The virtual screening study results open up a new therapeutic approach by using some phenalenones as hGLUT1 inhibitors, which might be a potential target for cancer therapy.", "Prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression has been recognized as a challenging problem due to the massive numbers of cognitive, and pathological features recorded for patients and controls. While there have been many studies investigated the diagnosis of dementia using pathological characteristics, predicting the advancement of the disease using cognitive elements has not been heavily studied particularly using technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning. This research aims at evaluating items of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 13 (ADAS-Cog-13) test to determine key cognitive items that influence the progression of AD. A methodology that consists of machine learning and feature selection (FS) techniques was designed, implemented, and then tested against real data observations (cases and controls) of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) repository with a narrow scope on cognitive items of the ADAS-Cog-13 test. Results obtained by ten-fold cross validation and using dissimilar classification and FS techniques revealed that the decision tree algorithm produced classification models with the best performing results from the cognitive items. For ADAS-Cog-13 test, memory and learning features including word recall, delayed word recall and word recognition were the key items pinpointing to AD advancement. When these three cognitive items are processed excluding demographics by C4.5 algorithm the models derived showed 82.90% accuracy, 87.60% sensitivity and 78.20% specificity.", "The field of advanced digital signal processing methods is one of the fastest developing scientific and technical disciplines, and is important in the field of Shunt Active Power Filter control methods. Shunt active power filters are highly desirable to minimize losses due to the increase in the number of nonlinear loads (deformed power). Currently, there is rapid development in new adaptive, non-adaptive, and especially hybrid methods of digital signal processing. Nowadays, modern methods of digital signal processing maintain a key role in research and industrial applications. Many of the best practices that have been used to control shunt active power in industrial practice for decades are now being surpassed in favor of new progressive approaches. This systematic research review classifies the importance of using advanced signal processing methods in the field of shunt active power filter control methods and summarizes the extant harmonic extraction methods, from the conventional approach to new progressive methods using genetic algorithms, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Synchronization techniques are described and compared as well.", "Today, there is growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of digital radiology (DR). This is also due to the push that has been applied in this sector due to the pandemic. Many studies are devoted to the challenges of integration in the health domain. One of the most important challenges is that of regulations. This study conducted a narrative review of reviews on the international approach to the regulation of AI in DR. The design of the study was based on: (I) An overview on Scopus and Pubmed (II) A qualification and eligibility process based on a standardized checklist and a scoring system. The results have highlighted an international approach to the regulation of these systems classified as \"software as medical devices (SaMD)\" arranged into: ethical issues, international regulatory framework, and bottlenecks of the legal issues. Several recommendations emerge from the analysis. They are all based on fundamental pillars: (a) The need to overcome a differentiated approach between countries. (b) The need for greater transparency and publicity of information both for SaMDs as a whole and for the algorithms and test patterns. (c) The need for an interdisciplinary approach that avoids bias (including demographic) in algorithms and test data. (d) The need to reduce some limits/gaps of the scientific literature production that do not cover the international approach.", "Early detection of high fall risk is an important process of fall prevention in hospitalized elderly patients. Hospitalized elderly patients can face several falling risks. Monitoring systems can be utilized to protect health and lives, and monitoring models can be less effective if the alarm is not invoked in real time. Therefore, in this paper we propose a monitoring prediction system that incorporates artificial intelligence. The proposed system utilizes a scalable clustering technique, namely the Catboost method, for binary classification. These techniques are executed on the Snowflake platform to rapidly predict safe and risky incidence for hospitalized elderly patients. A later stage employs a deep learning model (DNN) that is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Risky incidences are further classified into various monitoring alert types (falls, falls with broken bones, falls that lead to death). At this phase, the model employs adaptive sampling techniques to elucidate the unbalanced overfitting in the datasets. A performance study utilizes the benchmarks datasets, namely SERV-112 and SV-S2017 of the image sequences for assessing accuracy. The simulation depicts that the system has higher true positive counts in case of all health-related risk incidences. The proposed system depicts real-time classification speed with lower training time. The performance of the proposed multi-risk prediction is high at 87.4% in the SERV-112 dataset and 98.71% in the SV-S2017 dataset.", "Accurately predicting resistance spot welding (RSW) quality is essential for the manufacturing process. In this study, the RSW process signals of 2219/5A06 aluminum alloy under two assembly conditions (including gap and spacing) were analyzed, and then artificial intelligence modeling was carried out. To improve the performance and efficiency of RSW quality evaluation, this study proposed a multi-signal fusion method that was performed by combining principal component analysis and a correlation analysis. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model was optimized using the sine-chaotic-map-improved sparrow search algorithm (SSA), and the input and output of the model were the variables after multi-signal fusion and the button diameter, respectively. Compared with the standard BPNN model, the Sine-SSA-BP model reduced the MAE by 42.33%, MSE by 51.84%, and RMSE by 31.45%. Its R2 coefficient reached 0.6482, which is much higher than that of BP (0.2464). According to various indicators (MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2), the evaluation performance of the Sine-SSA-BP model was better than that of the standard BPNN model. Compared with other models (BP, GA-BP, PSO-BP, SSA-BP, and Sine-PSO-BP), the evaluation performance of the Sine-SSA-BP model was best, which can successfully predict abnormal spot welds.", "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a platform for high-resolution topographical imaging and the mechanical characterization of a wide range of samples, including live cells, proteins, and other biomolecules. AFM is also instrumental for measuring interaction forces and binding kinetics for protein-protein or receptor-ligand interactions on live cells at a single-molecule level. However, performing force measurements and high-resolution imaging with AFM and data analytics are time-consuming and require special skill sets and continuous human supervision. Recently, researchers have explored the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) in the bioimaging field. However, the applications of AI to AFM operations for live-cell characterization are little-known. In this work, we implemented a DL framework to perform automatic sample selection based on the cell shape for AFM probe navigation during AFM biomechanical mapping. We also established a closed-loop scanner trajectory control for measuring multiple cell samples at high speed for automated navigation. With this, we achieved a 60\u00d7 speed-up in AFM navigation and reduced the time involved in searching for the particular cell shape in a large sample. Our innovation directly applies to many bio-AFM applications with AI-guided intelligent automation through image data analysis together with smart navigation.", "Iodine deficiency, the most common cause of preventable mental impairment worldwide, has been linked to poorer intellectual function in several studies. However, to our knowledge, no studies have been performed in moderate iodine-deficient schoolchildren using the complete form of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III; Portuguese version). The main purpose of this study was to ascertain whether moderate iodine deficiency would affect the cognitive function of schoolchildren (7-11 years old; 3rd and 4th grades). Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (CPM; Portuguese version) were used for measuring the intelligence quotient (IQ) of the total population (n = 256; median UIC = 66.2 \u03bcg/L), and the WISC-III was used to study two selected subgroups: one moderately iodine-deficient (n = 30) and the other with adequate iodine intake (n = 30). WISC-III was shown to be the prime instrument for cognitive function assessment among moderate iodine-deficient schoolchildren; this subgroup had a Full-Scale IQ 15.13 points lower than the adequate iodine intake subgroup, with a magnitude effect of d = 0.7 (p = 0.013). Significant differences were also registered in 6 of the 13 Verbal-Performance IQ subtests. Moderate iodine deficiency has a substantial impact on mental development and cognitive functioning of schoolchildren, with significant impairment in both Performance IQ and Verbal IQ spectrum, adversely impacting their educational performance.", "The increased global waste generation rates over the last few decades have made the waste management task a significant problem. One of the potential approaches adopted globally is to recycle a significant portion of generated waste. However, the contamination of recyclable waste has been a major problem in this context and causes almost 75% of recyclable waste to be unusable. For sustainable development, efficient management and recycling of waste are of huge importance. To reduce the waste contamination rates, conventionally, a manual bin-tagging approach is adopted; however, this is inefficient and requires huge labor effort. Within household waste contamination, plastic bags have been found to be one of the main contaminants. Towards automating the process of plastic-bag contamination detection, this paper proposes an edge-computing video analytics solution using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and computer vision technologies. The proposed system is based on the idea of capturing video of waste from the truck hopper, processing it using edge-computing hardware to detect plastic-bag contamination and storing the contamination-related information for further analysis. Faster R-CNN and You Only Look Once version 4 (YOLOv4) deep learning model variants are trained using the Remondis Contamination Dataset (RCD) developed from Remondis manual tagging historical records. The overall system was evaluated in terms of software and hardware performance using standard evaluation measures (i.e., training performance, testing performance, Frames Per Second (FPS), system usage, power consumption). From the detailed analysis, YOLOv4 with CSPDarkNet_tiny was identified as a suitable candidate with a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 63% and FPS of 24.8 with NVIDIA Jetson TX2 hardware. The data collected from the deployment of edge-computing hardware on waste collection trucks was used to retrain the models and improved performance in terms of mAP, False Positives (FPs), False Negatives (FNs) and True Positives (TPs) was achieved for the retrained YOLOv4 with CSPDarkNet_tiny backbone model. A detailed cost analysis of the proposed system is also provided for stakeholders and policy makers.", "Two large randomized controlled trials of low-dose CT (LDCT)-based lung cancer screening (LCS) in high-risk smoker populations have shown a reduction in the number of lung cancer deaths in the screening group compared to a control group. Even if various countries are currently considering the implementation of LCS programs, recurring doubts and fears persist about the potentially high false positive rates, cost-effectiveness, and the availability of radiologists for scan interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially increase the efficiency of LCS. The objective of this article is to review the performances of AI algorithms developed for different tasks that make up the interpretation of LCS CT scans, and to estimate how these AI algorithms may be used as a second reader. Despite the reduction in lung cancer mortality due to LCS with LDCT, many smokers die of comorbid smoking-related diseases. The identification of CT features associated with these comorbidities could increase the value of screening with minimal impact on LCS programs. Because these smoking-related conditions are not systematically assessed in current LCS programs, AI can identify individuals with evidence of previously undiagnosed cardiovascular disease, emphysema or osteoporosis and offer an opportunity for treatment and prevention.", "With the rapid development of 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-performance computing (HPC), there is a huge increase in the data exchanged between the processor and memory. However, the \"storage wall\" caused by the von Neumann architecture severely limits the computational performance of the system. To efficiently process such large amounts of data and break up the \"storage wall\", it is necessary to develop processing-in-memory (PIM) technology. Chiplet combines processor cores and memory chips with advanced packaging technologies, such as 2.5D, 3 dimensions (3D), and fan-out packaging. This improves the quality and bandwidth of signal transmission and alleviates the \"storage wall\" problem.

However, accomplishing and further transcending human intelligence with artificial intelligence still confront many barriers. Here, we present a self-powered stretchable three-dimensional remote tactile device (3D-RTD) that performs the depth-of-field (DOF) sensation of external mechanical motions through a conductive-dielectric heterogeneous structure. The device can build a logic relationship precisely between DOF motions of an external active object and sensory potential signals of bipolar sign, frequency, amplitude, etc. The sensory mechanism is revealed on the basis of the electrostatic theory and multiphysics modeling, and the performance is verified via an artificial-biological hybrid system with micro/macroscale interaction. The feasibility of the 3D-RTD as an obstacle-avoidance patch for the blind is systematically demonstrated with a rat. This work paves the way for multimodal neuromorphic device that transcends the function of a biological one toward a new modality for brain-like intelligence.", "Additional degrees of freedom in a fractional-order control strategy for power electronic converters are well received despite the lack of reliable tuning methods. Despite artificial/swarm intelligence techniques have been used to adjust controller parameters to improve more than one characteristic/property at the same time, smart tuning not always leads to realizable structures or reachable parameter values. Thus, adjustment boundaries to ensure controller viability are needed. In this manuscript the fractional-order approach is described in terms of El-Khazali biquadratic module, which produces the lowest order approximation, instead of using a definition. A two-modes controller structure is synthesize depending on uncontrolled plant needs and parameters are adjusted through particle swarm and genetic optimization algorithms for comparison. Two error-based minimization criteria are used to consider output performance into the process. Two restrictions complement the optimization scheme, one seeks to ensure desired robustness while the other prevents from synthesizing a high-gain controller. Optimization results showed similarity between minima obtained and significant difference between parameters of those controller optimized without the proposed constraints was determined. Numerical and experimental results are provide to validate proposed approach effectiveness. Effective regulation, good tracking characteristic and robustness in the presence of load variations are the main results.", "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a new coronavirus, has affected economic and social standards as governments and healthcare regulatory agencies throughout the world expressed worry and explored harsh preventative measures to counteract the disease's spread and intensity. Several academics and experts are primarily concerned with halting the continuous spread of the unique virus. Social separation, the closing of borders, the avoidance of big gatherings, contactless transit, and quarantine are important methods. Multiple nations employ autonomous, digital, wireless, and other promising technologies to tackle this coronary pneumonia. This research examines a number of potential technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, deep learning (DL), the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, and virtual reality (VR), in an effort to mitigate the danger of COVID-19. Due to their ability to transport food and medical supplies to a specific location, UAVs are currently being utilized as an innovative method to combat this illness. This research intends to examine the possibilities of UAVs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic from several angles. UAVs offer intriguing options for delivering medical supplies, spraying disinfectants, broadcasting communications, conducting surveillance, inspecting, and screening patients for infection. This article examines the use of drones in healthcare as well as the advantages and disadvantages of strict adoption. Finally, challenges, opportunities, and future work are discussed to assist in adopting drone technology to tackle COVID-19-like diseases.", "High-resolution CT (HRCT) imaging features of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) patients are related to glucocorticoid sensitivity. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model to assess glucocorticoid efficacy according to the HRCT imaging features of IIP. The medical records and chest HRCT images of 150 patients with IIP were analyzed retrospectively. The U-net framework was used to create a model for recognizing different imaging features, including ground glass opacities, reticulations, honeycombing, and consolidations. Then, the area ratio of those imaging features was calculated automatically. Forty-five patients were treated with glucocorticoids, and according to the drug efficacy, they were divided into a glucocorticoid-sensitive group and a glucocorticoid-insensitive group. Models assessing the correlation between imaging features and glucocorticoid sensitivity were established using the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. The total accuracy (ACC) and mean intersection over union (mIoU) of the U-net model were 0.9755 and 0.4296, respectively. Out of the 45 patients treated with glucocorticoids, 34 and 11 were placed in the glucocorticoid-sensitive and glucocorticoid-insensitive groups, respectively. The KNN-based model had an accuracy of 0.82. An artificial intelligence model was successfully developed for recognizing different imaging features of IIP and a preliminary model for assessing the correlation between imaging features and glucocorticoid sensitivity in IIP patients was established.", "Inspection methods, also known as non-destructive evaluation (NDE), is a process for inspecting materials, products, and facilities to identify flaws, imperfections, and malfunctions without destruction or changing the integrity of materials, structures, and mechanisms. However, detecting those defects requires test conducting and results inferring, which is highly demanding in terms of analysis, performance, and time. New technologies are therefore needed to increase the efficiency, probability of detection, and interpretability of NDE methods to establish smart inspection. In this context, Artificial intelligence (AI), as a fundamental component of the Industry 4.0, is a well-suited tool to address downsides associated with the current NDE methods for analysis and interpretation of inspection results, where methods integrating AI into their inspection process become automated and are known as smart inspection methods. This article sheds a light on the conventional methods and the smart techniques used in defects detection. Subsequently, a comparison between the two notions is presented. Furthermore, it investigates opportunities for the integration of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods and Industry 4.0 technologies. In addition, the challenges hindering the progress of the domain are mentioned as the potential solutions. To this end, along with Industry 4.0 technologies, a virtual inspection system has been proposed to deploy smart inspection.", "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, much more attention has been paid to deep learning. However, as the complexity of learning algorithms increases, the needs of computation power of hardware facilities become more crucial. Instead of the focus being on computing devices like GPU computers, a lightweight learning algorithm could be the answer for this problem. Cross-domain applications of deep learning have attracted great interest amongst researchers in academia and industries. For beginners who do not have enough support with software and hardware, an open-source development environment is very helpful. In this paper, a relatively lightweight algorithm YOLOv5s is addressed, and the Google Colab is used for model training and testing. Based on the developed environment, many state-of-art learning algorithms can be studied for performance comparisons. To highlight the benefits of one-stage object detection algorithms, the recognition of clothing styles is investigated. The image samples are selected from datasets of fashion clothes and the web crawling of online stores. The image data are categorized into five groups: plaid; plain; block; horizontal; and vertical. Average precison, mean average precison, recall, F1-score, model size, and frame per second are the metrics used for performance validations. From the experimental outcomes, it shows that YOLOv5s is better than other learning algorithms in the recognition accuracy and detection speed.", "Healthcare data are inherently multimodal, including electronic health records (EHR), medical images, and multi-omics data. Combining these multimodal data sources contributes to a better understanding of human health and provides optimal personalized healthcare. The most important question when using multimodal data is how to fuse them-a field of growing interest among researchers. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly machine learning (ML), enable the fusion of these different data modalities to provide multimodal insights. To this end, in this scoping review, we focus on synthesizing and analyzing the literature that uses AI techniques to fuse multimodal medical data for different clinical applications. More specifically, we focus on studies that only fused EHR with medical imaging data to develop various AI methods for clinical applications. We present a comprehensive analysis of the various fusion strategies, the diseases and clinical outcomes for which multimodal fusion was used, the ML algorithms used to perform multimodal fusion for each clinical application, and the available multimodal medical datasets. We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. We searched Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar to retrieve relevant studies. After pre-processing and screening, we extracted data from 34 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We found that studies fusing imaging data with EHR are increasing and doubling from 2020 to 2021. In our analysis, a typical workflow was observed: feeding raw data, fusing different data modalities by applying conventional machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms, and finally, evaluating the multimodal fusion through clinical outcome predictions. Specifically, early fusion was the most used technique in most applications for multimodal learning (22 out of 34 studies). We found that multimodality fusion models outperformed traditional single-modality models for the same task. Disease diagnosis and prediction were the most common clinical outcomes (reported in 20 and 10 studies, respectively) from a clinical outcome perspective. Neurological disorders were the dominant category (16 studies). From an AI perspective, conventional ML models were the most used (19 studies), followed by DL models (16 studies). Multimodal data used in the included studies were mostly from private repositories (21 studies). Through this scoping review, we offer new insights for researchers interested in knowing the current state of knowledge within this research field.", "This study aims at the implementation of an Artificial Intelligence approach to the use of music for supporting the neurorehabilitation of children with brain injuries or neurological difficulties.The output of this study will be the implementation of an app for mobile devices with games to be played by pediatric patients, allowing time for their cognitive and motor abilities to recover while enjoying pleasant activities. In particular, a Neural Network Classification approach is proposed in order to automatically adapt the game difficulty to the current cognitive capabilities of the child.", "Efficient and accurate dengue risk prediction is an important basis for dengue prevention and control, which faces challenges, such as downloading and processing multi-source data to generate risk predictors and consuming significant time and computational resources to train and validate models locally. In this context, this study proposed a framework for dengue risk prediction by integrating big geospatial data cloud computing based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and artificial intelligence modeling on the Google Colab platform. It enables defining the epidemiological calendar, delineating the predominant area of dengue transmission in cities, generating the data of risk predictors, and defining multi-date ahead prediction scenarios. We implemented the experiments based on weekly dengue cases during 2013-2020 in the Federal District and Fortaleza, Brazil to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Four predictors were considered, including total rainfall (Rsum), mean temperature (Tmean), mean relative humidity (RHmean), and mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVImean). Three models (i.e., random forest (RF), long-short term memory (LSTM), and LSTM with attention mechanism (LSTM-ATT)), and two modeling scenarios (i.e., modeling with or without dengue cases) were set to implement 1- to 4-week ahead predictions. A total of 24 models were built, and the results showed in general that LSTM and LSTM-ATT models outperformed RF models; modeling could benefit from using historical dengue cases as one of the predictors, and it makes the predicted curve fluctuation more stable compared with that only using climate and environmental factors; attention mechanism could further improve the performance of LSTM models. This study provides implications for future dengue risk prediction in terms of the effectiveness of GEE-based big geospatial data processing for risk predictor generation and Google Colab-based risk modeling and presents the benefits of using historical dengue data as one of the input features and the attention mechanism for LSTM modeling.", "The complexity of creative processes, within which human nature pines and finds itself, reflects a state of relational emergency. The weak structure of our multicultural system gives us a series of behavioral flaws, denouncing our inability to welcome diversity and treasure it. In the search for the way out, using the metaphor of polyphony is increasingly frequent. However, since the term Polyphony is borrowed from musical language, it would be necessary to experience it concretely, and this usually does not happen. Those musicians who aspire to be artists in helping relationships should constantly train themselves in this sense and force themselves to make their ability understood externally, helping those who for reasons of life find themselves experiencing the limit. The field of palliative care is probably the most suitable socio-cultural setting for getting in touch with the personal (mis)interpretations, idiosyncrasies, and pain of those who feel close to the end. To their aid, the aesthetic criterion advances. Making sacred the unifying experience of loss and finiteness turns into an educational process moreover therapeutic, in the co-construction of an elegant \"finale\" able to reach the heart and intelligence of those who remain.", "Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are disabling conditions with a negative impact on the quality of life. Their diagnosis is a complex and multi-factorial process that should be conducted by experienced professionals, and most TMDs remain often undetected. Increasing the awareness of un-experienced dentists and supporting the early TMD recognition may help reduce this gap. Artificial intelligence (AI) allowing both to process natural language and to manage large knowledge bases could support the diagnostic process.\nIn this work, we present the experience of an AI-based system for supporting non-expert dentists in early TMD recognition.\nThe system was based on commercially available AI services. The prototype development involved a preliminary domain analysis and relevant literature identification, the implementation of the core cognitive computing services, the web interface and preliminary testing. Performance evaluation included a retrospective review of seven available clinical cases, together with the involvement of expert professionals for usability testing.\nThe system comprises one module providing possible diagnoses according to a list of symptoms, and a second one represented by a question and answer tool, based on natural language. We found that, even when using commercial services, the training guided by experts is a key factor and that, despite the generally positive feedback, the application's best target is untrained professionals.\nWe provided a preliminary proof of concept of the feasibility of implementing an AI-based system aimed to support non-specialists in the early identification of TMDs, possibly allowing a faster and more frequent referral to second-level medical centres. Our results showed that AI is a useful tool to improve TMD detection by facilitating a primary diagnosis.", "Stroke is an acute neurological dysfunction attributed to a focal injury of the central nervous system due to reduced blood flow to the brain. Nowadays, stroke is a global threat associated with premature death and huge economic consequences. Hence, there is an urgency to model the effect of several risk factors on stroke occurrence, and artificial intelligence (AI) seems to be the appropriate tool. In the present study, we aimed to (i) develop reliable machine learning (ML) prediction models for stroke disease; (ii) cope with a typical severe class imbalance problem, which is posed due to the stroke patients' class being significantly smaller than the healthy class; and (iii) interpret the model output for understanding the decision-making mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed ML approach was investigated in a comparative analysis with six well-known classifiers with respect to metrics that are related to both generalization capability and prediction accuracy. The best overall false-negative rate was achieved by the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier (18.60%). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were employed to investigate the impact of the risk factors on the prediction output. The proposed AI method could lead to the creation of advanced and effective risk stratification strategies for each stroke patient, which would allow for timely diagnosis and the right treatments.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has driven innovative transformation in healthcare service patterns, despite a lack of understanding of its performance in clinical practice. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of AI-related trials in healthcare based on ClinicalTrials.gov, intending to investigate the trial characteristics and AI's development status. Additionally, the Neo4j graph database and visualization technology were employed to construct an AI technology application graph, achieving a visual representation and analysis of research hotspots in healthcare AI. A total of 1725 eligible trials that were registered in ClinicalTrials.gov up to 31 March 2022 were included in this study. The number of trial registrations has dramatically grown each year since 2016. However, the AI-related trials had some design drawbacks and problems with poor-quality result reporting. The proportion of trials with prospective and randomized designs was insufficient, and most studies did not report results upon completion. Currently, most healthcare AI application studies are based on data-driven learning algorithms, covering various disease areas and healthcare scenarios. As few studies have publicly reported results on ClinicalTrials.gov, there is not enough evidence to support an assessment of AI's actual performance. The widespread implementation of AI technology in healthcare still faces many challenges and requires more high-quality prospective clinical validation.", "We investigated to what extent early motor development problems predict a future diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs)/Early Symptomatic Syndromes Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Examinations (ESSENCE) by using a Bayesian network model (BN).\nSubjects were the children who had participated in the 18- and 36-month checkups in two cities in Japan between April 2014 and March 2015. Their motor development data at the 4-, 10- and 18-month-checkups were collected with ethical consideration. The diagnosis was confirmed at the age of six, after regular assessment in all developmental areas at a neurodevelopmental clinic. The accuracy of prediction of NDD based on posterior probabilities determined using the BN was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The posterior probability (the optimal cut-off value) yielding the maximum Youden Index (sensitivity + specificity - 1) is determined with the ROC curve, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and utility index (UI) were computed.\nBN models showed associations between early motor items and developmental coordination disorders, borderline intelligence/intellectual disability, and speech and language disorder. The ROC curve for any NDD had an AUC of 0.735. The posterior probability with the maximal Youden Index was 0.138; at the optimal cut-off value, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, UI+, and UI- were 0.619, 0.761, 0.250, 0.940, 0.155 and 0.715, respectively.\nWe utilized a novel approach in detailing the associations between certain early motor problems and specific NDDs. We showed that the presence of motor development problems early in development increases the probability of a future diagnosis of any NDD. Still, the sensitivity of early motor development problems as a screening tool was not high enough to be the sole instrument for detecting NDDs. The need for a broad, holistic ESSENCE perspective when looking at the course of motor development problems was stressed.", "Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction (CLR) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are crucial for the host antitumor immune response. We proposed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model to quantify the density of TILs and CLR in immunohistochemical (IHC)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) and further constructed the CLR-I (immune) score, a tissue level- and cell level-based immune factor, to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The TILs score and CLR score were obtained according to the related density. And the CLR-I score was calculated by summing two scores. The development (Hospital 1, N\u00a0=\u00a0370) and validation (Hospital 2 & 3, N\u00a0=\u00a0144) cohorts were used to evaluate the prognostic value of the CLR-I score. The C-index and integrated area under the curve were used to assess the discrimination ability. A higher CLR-I score was associated with a better prognosis, which was identified by multivariable analysis in the development (hazard ratio for score 3 vs score 0\u00a0=\u00a00.22, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.40, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and validation cohort (0.21, 0.05-0.78, P\u00a0=\u00a00.020). The AI-based CLR-I score outperforms the single predictor in predicting OS which is objective and more prone to be deployed in clinical practice.", "Stroke and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) significantly affect the world population. The early detection of such events may prevent the burden of death and costly surgery. Conventional methods are neither automated nor clinically accurate. Artificial Intelligence-based methods of automatically detecting and predicting the severity of CVD and stroke in their early stages are of prime importance. This study proposes an attention-channel-based UNet deep learning (DL) model that identifies the carotid plaques in the internal carotid artery (ICA) and common carotid artery (CCA) images. Our experiments consist of 970 ICA images from the UK, 379 CCA images from diabetic Japanese patients, and 300 CCA images from post-menopausal women from Hong Kong. We combined both CCA images to form an integrated database of 679 images. A rotation transformation technique was applied to 679 CCA images, doubling the database for the experiments. The cross-validation K5 (80% training: 20% testing) protocol was applied for accuracy determination. The results of the Attention-UNet model are benchmarked against UNet, UNet++, and UNet3P models. Visual plaque segmentation showed improvement in the Attention-UNet results compared to the other three models. The correlation coefficient (CC) value for Attention-UNet is 0.96, compared to 0.93, 0.96, and 0.92 for UNet, UNet++, and UNet3P models. Similarly, the AUC value for Attention-UNet is 0.97, compared to 0.964, 0.966, and 0.965 for other models. Conclusively, the Attention-UNet model is beneficial in segmenting very bright and fuzzy plaque images that are hard to diagnose using other methods. Further, we present a multi-ethnic, multi-center, racial bias-free study of stroke risk assessment.", "The number of studies on the relationship between training and competition load and injury has increased exponentially in recent years, and it is also widely studied by researchers in the field of professional soccer. In order to provide practical guidance for workload management and injury prevention in professional athletes, this study provides a review of the literature on the effect of load on injury risk, injury prediction, and interpretation mechanisms. The results of the research show that: (1) It appears that short-term fixture congestion may increase the match injury incidence, while long-term fixture congestion may have no effect on both the overall injury incidence and the match injury incidence. (2) It is impossible to determine conclusively whether any global positioning system (GPS)-derived metrics (total distance, high-speed running distance, and acceleration) are associated with an increased risk of injury. (3) The acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR) of the session rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) may be significantly associated with the risk of non-contact injuries, but an ACWR threshold with a minimum risk of injury could not be obtained. (4) Based on the workload and fatigue recovery factors, artificial intelligence technology may possess good predictive power regarding injury risk.", "The last two years are considered the most crucial and critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting most life aspects worldwide. This virus spreads quickly within a short period, increasing the fatality rate associated with the virus. From a clinical perspective, several diagnosis methods are carried out for early detection to avoid virus propagation. However, the capabilities of these methods are limited and have various associated challenges. Consequently, many studies have been performed for COVID-19 automated detection without involving manual intervention and allowing an accurate and fast decision. As is the case with other diseases and medical issues, Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides the medical community with potential technical solutions that help doctors and radiologists diagnose based on chest images. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the mentioned AI-based detection solution proposals is conducted. More than 200 papers are reviewed and analyzed, and 145 articles have been extensively examined to specify the proposed AI mechanisms with chest medical images. A comprehensive examination of the associated advantages and shortcomings is illustrated and summarized. Several findings are concluded as a result of a deep analysis of all the previous works using machine learning for COVID-19 detection, segmentation, and classification.", "Regular monitoring of static lacunar infarction (SLI) lesions plays an important role in preventing disease development and managing prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging is one method used to monitor SLI lesions.\nTo evaluate the image quality of the T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) sequence using artificial intelligence-assisted compressed sensing (ACS) in detecting SLI lesions and assess its clinical applicability.\nA total of 42 patients were prospectively enrolled and scanned by T2-FLAIR. Two independent readers reviewed the images acquired with accelerated modes 1D (acceleration factor 2) and ACS (acceleration factors 2, 3, and 4). The overall image quality and lesion image quality were analyzed, as were signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and number of lesions between groups.\nThe subjective assessment of overall brain image quality and lesion image quality was consistent between the two readers. The lesion display quality and the overall image quality were better with the traditional 1D acceleration method than with the ACS accelerated method. There was no significant difference in the SNR of the lacunar infarction in the images between the groups. The CNR of the images with the 1D acceleration mode was significantly lower than that of images with the ACS acceleration mode. Images with the 1D, ACS2, and ACS3 acceleration modes showed no significant differences in terms of detecting lesions but scan time can be reduced by 40% (1D vs. ACS3).\nACS acceleration mode can greatly reduce the scan time. In addition, the images have good SNR, high CNR, and strong SLI lesion detection ability.", "To evaluate whether left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS), automatically calculated by artificial intelligence (AI), increases the diagnostic performance of stress echocardiography (SE) for coronary artery disease (CAD) detection.\nSEs from 512 participants who underwent a clinically indicated SE (with or without contrast) for the evaluation of CAD from seven hospitals in the UK and US were studied. Visual wall motion scoring (WMS) was performed to identify inducible ischaemia. In addition, SE images at rest and stress underwent AI contouring for automated calculation of AI-LVEF and AI-GLS (apical two and four chamber images only) with Ultromics EchoGo Core 1.0. Receiver operator characteristic curves and multivariable risk models were used to assess accuracy for identification of participants subsequently found to have CAD on angiography. Participants with significant CAD were more likely to have abnormal WMS, AI-LVEF, and AI-GLS values at rest and stress (all P < 0.001). The areas under the receiver operating characteristics for WMS index, AI-LVEF, and AI-GLS at peak stress were 0.92, 0.86, and 0.82, respectively, with cut-offs of 1.12, 64%, and -17.2%, respectively. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that addition of peak AI-LVEF or peak AI-GLS to WMS significantly improved model discrimination of CAD [C-statistic (bootstrapping 2.5th, 97.5th percentile)] from 0.78 (0.69-0.87) to 0.83 (0.74-0.91) or 0.84 (0.75-0.92), respectively.\nAI calculation of LVEF and GLS by contouring of contrast-enhanced and unenhanced SEs at rest and stress is feasible and independently improves the identification of obstructive CAD beyond conventional WMSI.", "We evaluate the ability of Artificial Intelligence with automatic classification methods applied to semi-quantitative data from brain 18F-FDG PET/CT to improve the differential diagnosis between Alzheimer Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).\nWe retrospectively analyzed a total of 150 consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic evaluation for suspected AD (n = 67) or MCI (n = 83). All patients received brain 18F-FDG PET/CT according to the international guidelines, and images were analyzed both Qualitatively (QL) and Quantitatively (QN), the latter by a fully automated post-processing software that produced a z score metabolic map of 25 anatomically different cortical regions. A subset of n = 122 cases with a confirmed diagnosis of AD (n = 53) or MDI (n = 69) by 18-24-month clinical follow-up was finally included in the study. Univariate analysis and three automated classification models (classification tree -ClT-, ridge classifier -RC- and linear Support Vector Machine -lSVM-) were considered to estimate the ability of the z scores to discriminate between AD and MCI cases in.\nThe univariate analysis returned 14 areas where the z scores were significantly different between AD and MCI groups, and the classification accuracy ranged between 74.59% and 76.23%, with ClT and RC providing the best results. The best classification strategy consisted of one single split with a cut-off value of \u2248 -2.0 on the z score from temporal lateral left area: cases below this threshold were classified as AD and those above the threshold as MCI.\nOur findings confirm the usefulness of brain 18F-FDG PET/CT QL and QN analyses in differentiating AD from MCI. Moreover, the combined use of automated classifications models can improve the diagnostic process since its use allows identification of a specific hypometabolic area involved in AD cases in respect to MCI. This data improves the traditional 18F-FDG PET/CT image interpretation and the diagnostic assessment of cognitive disorders.", "The history of medical records is thousand-year-long, with earlier roots in ancient civilizations. Until the 19th century, medical records mainly served educational purposes, later assuming other roles such as in insurance or legal procedures. This article comprehensively describes and reviews the development of medical records from ancient to modern times in Europe and North America, reflecting alterations and adaptations compliant with the mental and technological capabilities of a given period. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar databases to collect pertinent articles. English articles or those having English abstracts were considered. The search terms included \"Medical Records,\" \"Health Records,\" \"History of Medicine,\" and \"eHealth\" and covered the last hundred years. References were also picked out from the identified articles. Overall, 600 articles were identified, 158 of which were judged thematically relevant. The general conclusion is that medical records undergo a revolutionary change from paper-based to electronic format, which reflects the development of eHealth systems. The migration process to eHealth records involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that streamline medical services by using faster and simpler working methods. AI benefits both patients and providers as it improves patient management and communication among medical centers, spares resources, identifies contamination or infections, and limits health costs. These advantages have become pointedly apparent during the recent COVID-19 scourge.", "Brain metastases (BM) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced cancer. Despite significant advances in surgical, radiation, and systemic therapy in recent years, the median overall survival of patients with BM is less than 1 year. The acquisition of medical images, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is critical for the diagnosis and stratification of patients to appropriate treatments. Radiomic analyses have the potential to improve the standard of care for patients with BM by applying artificial intelligence (AI) with already acquired medical images to predict clinical outcomes and direct the personalized care of BM patients. Herein, we outline the existing literature applying radiomics for the clinical management of BM. This includes predicting patient response to radiotherapy and identifying radiation necrosis, performing virtual biopsies to predict tumor mutation status, and determining the cancer of origin in brain tumors identified via imaging. With further development, radiomics has the potential to aid in BM patient stratification while circumventing the need for invasive tissue sampling, particularly for patients not eligible for surgical resection.", "The global healthcare sector continues to grow rapidly and is reflected as one of the fastest-growing sectors in the fourth industrial revolution (4.0). The majority of the healthcare industry still uses labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone traditional, manual, and manpower-based methods. This review addresses the current paradigm, the potential for new scientific discoveries, the technological state of preparation, the potential for supervised machine learning (SML) prospects in various healthcare sectors, and ethical issues. The effectiveness and potential for innovation of disease diagnosis, personalized medicine, clinical trials, non-invasive image analysis, drug discovery, patient care services, remote patient monitoring, hospital data, and nanotechnology in various learning-based automation in healthcare along with the requirement for explainable artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare are evaluated. In order to understand the potential architecture of non-invasive treatment, a thorough study of medical imaging analysis from a technical point of view is presented. This study also represents new thinking and developments that will push the boundaries and increase the opportunity for healthcare through AI and SML in the near future. Nowadays, SML-based applications require a lot of data quality awareness as healthcare is data-heavy, and knowledge management is paramount. Nowadays, SML in biomedical and healthcare developments needs skills, quality data consciousness for data-intensive study, and a knowledge-centric health management system. As a result, the merits, demerits, and precautions need to take ethics and the other effects of AI and SML into consideration. The overall insight in this paper will help researchers in academia and industry to understand and address the future research that needs to be discussed on SML in the healthcare and biomedical sectors.", "Most research on Problematic Internet Usage (PIU) relied on self-report data when measuring the time spent on the internet. Self-reporting of use, typically done through a survey, showed discrepancies from the actual amount of use. Studies exploring the association between trait emotional intelligence (EI) components and the subjective feeling on technology usage and PIU are also limited. The current cross-sectional study aims to examine whether the objectively recorded technology usage, taking smartphone usage as a representative, components of trait EI (sociability, emotionality, well-being, self-control), and happiness with phone use can predict PIU and its components (obsession, neglect, and control disorder). A total of 268 participants (Female: 61.6%) reported their demographic and completed a questionnaire that included Problematic Internet Usage Questionnaire short form (PIUQ-SF-6), Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF), level of happiness with the amount and frequency of smartphone use, and living conditions (whether alone or with others). Their smartphone usage was objectively recorded through a dedicated app. A series of one-way ANOVA revealed no significant difference in PIU for different living conditions and a significant difference in the subjective level of happiness with phone usage (F (3, 264) = 7.55, p < .001), as well as of the frequency of usage where the unhappy group had higher PIU (F (3, 264) = 6.85, p < .001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that happiness with phone usage (\u03b2 = -.17), the actual usage of communication (\u03b2 = .17), social media (\u03b2 = .19) and gaming apps (\u03b2 = .13), and trait EI component of self-control (\u03b2 = -.28) were all significant predictors of PIU. Moreover, gender, age, and happiness with the frequency of phone usage were not significant predictors of PIU. The whole model accounted for the total variance of PIU by 32.5% (Adjusted R2 = .287). Our study contributes to the literature by being among the few to rely on objectively recorded smartphone usage data and utilizing components of trait EI as predictors.", "Background: Mothers are not only the axis of an ecological subsystem for their children but are also capable of creating a significant emotional and psychological environment through constant and direct interaction. This leads to interactions and emotional connections with the children, supportive behaviors, and a long-term commitment to their upbringing and development. Aims: This study examined the relationship between maternal emotional intelligence (EI) and demographics on the availability of motor affordances in the home environment that are conducive to their child's motor development. Methods: Mothers (N = 451) and homes of children aged 18-42 months were assessed using the Persian version of Affordances in the Home Environment for Motor Development-Self-Report (AHEMD-SR) and the Bar-On Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. In addition, mothers' physical activity (PA) experience and demographic data were collected. Results: Analyses indicated significant correlations between mothers' education, level of PA, and income with EI and motor affordances. Conclusions: EI, PA experience, and select mother demographics were important to the availability of motor affordances in the home. One could also speculate, based on previous research, that such provision may affect the future motor development of the child. Future research should include a younger and more diverse population.", "Little is known about incidence of vascular and Alzheimer dementias in American Indians.\nWe conducted a large, heterogeneous, population-based, longitudinal cohort study of brain aging in community-dwelling American Indians aged 64-95 years from 11 tribes across 3 states, with neurologic examinations, 1.5T MRI, and extensive cognitive testing. Visit 1 in 2010-2013 (n = 817) and visit 2 in 2017-2019 (n = 403) included all willing, surviving participants. Standardized cognitive tests at both visits included Modified Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale digit symbol coding (WAIS), Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA), and California Verbal Learning Test short form (CVLT). Test materials added at follow-up included Wide Range Achievement (reading) Test (WRAT) and National Alzheimer Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set cognitive battery (v3 form C2), including Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). MRI neuroradiologists coded infarcts, hemorrhages, white matter hyperintensities, sulcal atrophy, and ventricle enlargement.\nThe mean time between examinations was 6.7 years (SD 1.1, range 3.8-9.1 years). Years of formal education had modest correlation with WRAT reading score (r = 0.45). Prevalence and incidence (respectively) of infarcts were 32% and 12.8/1,000 person-years (PYs) hemorrhages 6% and 4.4/1000 PY worsening sulci 74% and 19.0/1000 PY worsening ventricle 79% and 30.1/1000 PY worsening leukoaraiosis 44% and 26.1/1000 PY. Linear losses per year in cognitive scores were 0.6% MMSE, 1.2% WAIS, 0.6% COWA, and 2.2% CVLT. The mean MoCA scores were 18.9 (SD 4.3).\nThese are the first data on longitudinal cognitive and imaging changes in American Indians and first reports of Alzheimer disease-related features. The mean scores in MoCA were similar or lower than standard cutoffs used to diagnose dementia in other racial/ethnic groups, suggesting that standardized cognitive tests may not perform well in this population. Test validation, adaptation, and score adjustment are warranted. Years of education were a poor proxy for premorbid function, suggesting novel methods for cognitive score contextualization is also needed in this population. Evaluation of selective survival suggests attrition from death, and frailty should be accounted for in causal analyses. Overall, these data represent a unique opportunity to examine neurology topics of critical importance to an understudied population.", "In this study, we propose a tensor-based learning model to efficiently detect abnormalities on digital mammograms. Due to the fact that the availability of medical data is limited and often restricted by GDPR (general data protection regulation) compliance, the need for more sophisticated and less data-hungry approaches is urgent. Accordingly, our proposed artificial intelligence framework utilizes the canonical polyadic decomposition to decrease the trainable parameters of the wrapped Rank-R FNN model, leading to efficient learning using small amounts of data. Our model was evaluated on the open source digital mammographic database INBreast and compared with state-of-the-art models in this domain. The experimental results show that the proposed solution performs well in comparison with the other deep learning models, such as AlexNet and SqueezeNet, achieving 90% \u00b1 4% accuracy and an F1 score of 84% \u00b1 5%. Additionally, our framework tends to attain more robust performance with small numbers of data and is computationally lighter for inference purposes, due to the small number of trainable parameters.", "Despite the importance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and PD-L1 expression to the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response, a comprehensive assessment of these biomarkers has not yet been conducted in neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN). We collected 218 NENs from multiple organs, including 190 low/intermediate-grade NENs and 28 high-grade NENs. TIL distribution was derived from Lunit SCOPE IO, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) analyzer, as developed from 17,849 whole slide images. The proportion of intra-tumoral TIL-high cases was significantly higher in high-grade NEN (75.0% vs. 46.3%, p = 0.008). The proportion of PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) \u2265 1 case was higher in high-grade NEN (85.7% vs. 33.2%, p < 0.001). The PD-L1 CPS \u2265 1 group showed higher intra-tumoral, stromal, and combined TIL densities, compared to the CPS < 1 group (7.13 vs. 2.95, p < 0.001; 200.9 vs. 120.5, p < 0.001; 86.7 vs. 56.1, p = 0.004). A significant correlation was observed between TIL density and PD-L1 CPS (r = 0.37, p < 0.001 for intra-tumoral TIL; r = 0.24, p = 0.002 for stromal TIL and combined TIL). AI-powered TIL analysis reveals that intra-tumoral TIL density is significantly higher in high-grade NEN, and PD-L1 CPS has a positive correlation with TIL densities, thus showing its value as predictive biomarkers for ICI response in NEN.", "One of the extraordinary characteristics of the biological brain is the low energy expense it requires to implement a variety of biological functions and intelligence as compared to the modern artificial intelligence (AI). Spike-based energy-efficient temporal codes have long been suggested as a contributor for the brain to run on low energy expense. Despite this code having been largely reported in the sensory cortex, whether this code can be implemented in other brain areas to serve broader functions and how it evolves throughout learning have remained unaddressed. In this study, we designed a novel brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm. Two macaques could volitionally generate reproducible energy-efficient temporal patterns in the primary motor cortex (M1) by learning the BMI paradigm. Moreover, most neurons that were not directly assigned to control the BMI did not boost their excitability, and they demonstrated an overall energy-efficient manner in performing the task. Over the course of learning, we found that the firing rates and temporal precision of selected neurons co-evolved to generate the energy-efficient temporal patterns, suggesting that a cohesive rather than dissociable processing underlies the refinement of energy-efficient temporal patterns.", "To investigate the influence of interpersonal emotion regulation and conscientiousness on team emotional intelligence. A total of 1369 college students were investigated with the conscientiousness subscale of Big Five Personality Questionnaire, Team Emotional Intelligence Scale and Leadership Positive Emotional Operation Questionnaire. Variance analysis, Pearson product difference correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis and path analysis were used. In order to avoid the possible skew problem, the bootstrap method was used to calculate the structural equation model. SPSS 22.0, Amos 24, R software were used for statistical analysis. A total of 1600 questionnaires were sent out and 1369 effective questionnaires were recovered. The total score of College Students' team emotional intelligence was 5.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.70, with 4.88\u2009\u00b1\u20090.87, 5.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.79, 4.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.91, 4.71\u2009\u00b1\u20090.83, 5.23\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00, and 5.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.91 for interpersonal understanding, asking for feedback, emotional management, organizational cognition, relationship building and problem-solving ability, respectively. Conscientiousness significantly predicted team emotional intelligence, and leadership's positive emotional operation. Furthermore, conscientiousness could predict team emotional intelligence through mediating individual emotional intelligence. Interpersonal positive emotion regulation played a part of mediating role between conscientiousness and team emotional intelligence.", "This systematic scoping review aims to map and identify the available artificial-intelligence-based techniques for imaging analysis, the characterization of stem cell differentiation, and trans-differentiation pathways. On the ninth of March 2022, data were collected from five electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus) and manual citation searching; all data were gathered in Zotero 5.0. A total of 4422 articles were collected after deduplication; only twenty-seven studies were included in this systematic scoping review after a two-phase screening against inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. The amount of research in this field is significantly increasing over the years. While the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) can tackle a multitude of medical problems, the consensus amongst researchers remains that AI still falls short in multiple ways that investigators should examine, ranging from the quality of images used in training sets and appropriate sample size, as well as the unexpected events that may occur which the algorithm cannot predict.", "X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) as the world's brightest light sources provide ultrashort X-ray pulses with a duration typically in the order of femtoseconds. Recently, they have approached and entered the attosecond regime, which holds new promises for single-molecule imaging and studying nonlinear and ultrafast phenomena such as localized electron dynamics. The technological evolution of XFELs toward well-controllable light sources for precise metrology of ultrafast processes has been, however, hampered by the diagnostic capabilities for characterizing X-ray pulses at the attosecond frontier. In this regard, the spectroscopic technique of photoelectron angular streaking has successfully proven how to non-destructively retrieve the exact time-energy structure of XFEL pulses on a single-shot basis. By using artificial intelligence techniques, in particular convolutional neural networks, we here show how this technique can be leveraged from its proof-of-principle stage toward routine diagnostics even at high-repetition-rate XFELs, thus enhancing and refining their scientific accessibility in all related disciplines.", "Platelet detection and counting play a greatly significant role in medical field, especially in routine blood tests which can be used to judge blood status and diagnose related diseases. Therefore, platelet detection is valuable for diagnosing related blood diseases such as liver-related diseases. Blood analyzers and visual microscope counting were widely used for platelet detection, but the experimental procedure took nearly 20 minutes and can only be performed by a professional doctor. In recent years, technological breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have made it possible to detect red blood cells through deep learning methods. However, due to the inaccessibility of platelet datasets and the small size of platelets, deep learning-based platelet detection studies are almost nonexistent. In this paper, we carried out experiments for platelet detection based on commonly used object detection models, such as Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), RetinaNet, Faster_rcnn, and You Only Look Once_v3 (YOLO_v3). Compared with the other three models, YOLO_v3 can detect platelets more effectively. And we proposed three ideas for improvement based on YOLO_v3. Our study demonstrated that YOLO_v3 can be adopted for platelet detection accurately and in real time. We also implemented YOLO_v3 with multiscale fusion, YOLO_v3 with anchor box clustering, and YOLO_v3 with match parameter on our self-created dataset and, respectively, achieved 1.8% higher average precision (AP), 2.38% higher AP, and 2.05% higher AP than YOLO_v3. The comprehensive experiments revealed that YOLO_v3 with the improved ideas performs better in platelet detection than YOLO_v3.", "Detection of foodborne pathogens at an early stage is very important to control food quality and improve medical response. Rapid detection of foodborne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity is becoming an urgent requirement in health safety, medical diagnostics, environmental safety, and controlling food quality. Despite the existing bacterial detection methods being reliable and widely used, these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and cumbersome. Therefore, researchers are trying to find new methods by integrating spectroscopy techniques with artificial intelligence and advanced materials. Within this progress report, advances in the detection of foodborne pathogens using spectroscopy techniques are discussed. This paper presents an overview of the progress and application of spectroscopy techniques for the detection of foodborne pathogens, particularly new trends in the past few years, including surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence spectroscopy, multiangle laser light scattering, and imaging analysis. In addition, the applications of artificial intelligence, microfluidics, smartphone-based techniques, and advanced materials related to spectroscopy for the detection of bacterial pathogens are discussed. Finally, we conclude and discuss possible research prospects in aspects of spectroscopy techniques for the identification and classification of pathogens.", "Cephalometric analysis is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning and outcome assessment of orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve automated landmark localization has proved feasible and convenient. However, current systems remain insufficient for clinical application, as patients exhibit various malocclusions in cephalograms produced by different manufacturers while limited cephalograms were applied to train AI in these systems.\nA robust and clinically applicable AI system was proposed for automatic cephalometric analysis. First, 9870 cephalograms taken by different radiography machines with various malocclusions of patients were collected from 20 medical institutions. Then 30 landmarks of all these cephalogram samples were manually annotated to train an AI system, composed of a two-stage convolutional neural network and a software-as-a-service system. Further, more than 100 orthodontists participated to refine the AI-output landmark localizations and retrain this system.\nThe average landmark prediction error of this system was as low as 0.94 \u00b1 0.74\u2009mm and the system achieved an average classification accuracy of 89.33%.\nAn automatic cephalometric analysis system based on convolutional neural network was proposed, which can realize automatic landmark location and cephalometric measurements classification. This system showed promise in improving diagnostic efficiency in clinical circumstances.", "Rare diseases can often be diagnosed by carefully assessing the phenotype of the patient, as characteristic deviations (dysmorphisms) occur in many genetic diseases. These affect, for example, the features of the face - the \"facial gestalt.\"This paper highlights an area of artificial intelligence (AI) in which there has been great progress in recent years: the recognition of characteristic patterns in medical image data using deep, convolutional neural networks (next-generation phenotyping - NGP). The technical basis of the method is briefly described and the high relevance of FAIR data for the scientific community to develop AI is discussed. Furthermore, it is explained why decisions made by AI should always remain comprehensible and how it can overcome the challenges with regard to data protection and transparency.In the future, software applications with AI will support medical professionals in the diagnosis of rare diseases. AI will be trustworthy if patients retain their data sovereignty and can understand how the diagnosis was made.\nDurch die Analyse des Erscheinungsbildes (Ph\u00e4notyp) von Patient:innen kann die Diagnostik von Seltenen Erkrankungen unterst\u00fctzt werden, da bei vielen genetischen Erkrankungen charakteristische Abweichungen (Dysmorphologien) auftreten.

Whenever a virus spreads and becomes a threat to global health, it brings along the challenge of developing new therapeutics and prophylactics. Computational drug and vaccine discovery has evolved quickly over the years. Some interesting examples of computational drug discovery are anti-AIDS drugs, where HIV protease and reverse transcriptase have been targeted by agents developed using computational methods. Various computational methods that have been applied to anti-viral research include ligand-based methods that rely on known active compounds, i.e., pharmacophore modeling, machine learning or classical QSAR; structure-based methods that rely on an experimentally determined 3D structure of the targets, i.e., molecular docking and molecular dynamics and methods for the development of vaccines such as reverse vaccinology; structural vaccinology and vaccine epitope prediction. This review summarizes these approaches to battle viral diseases and underscores their importance for anti-viral research. We discuss the role of computational methods in developing small molecules and vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus, yellow fever, human papilloma virus, SARS-CoV-2, and other viruses. Various computational tools available for the abovementioned purposes have been listed and described. A discussion on applying artificial intelligence-based methods for antiviral drug discovery has also been included.", "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is largely managed in primary care, but physicians vary widely in their understanding of symptoms and treatments. This study aims to better understand the evolution of depression from initial diagnosis over a 3-year period.\nThis was a noninterventional, retrospective, longitudinal study, with 2 waves of participant interviews approximately 3\u00a0years apart. Phone interviews were conducted using the hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) Sleep-EVAL system, an AI-driven diagnostic deep learning tool. Participants were noninstitutionalized adults representative of the general population in 8 US states. Diagnosis was confirmed according to the DSM-5 using the Sleep-EVAL System.\n10,931 participants completed Wave 1 and 2 (W1, W2) interviews. The prevalence of MDD, including partial and complete remission, was 13.4\u00a0% and 19.6\u00a0% in W1 and W2, respectively. About 42\u00a0% of MDD participants at W1 continued to report depressive symptoms at W2. Approximately half of antidepressant (AD) users in W1 were moderately to completely dissatisfied with their treatment; 29.6\u00a0% changed their AD for a different one, with 16.4\u00a0% switching from one SSRI to another between W1 and W2. Primary care physicians were the top AD prescribers, both in W1 (45.7\u00a0%) and W2 (59%), respectively.\nData collected relied on self-reporting by participants. As such, the interpretation of the data may be limited.\nDepression affects a sizeable portion of the US population. Dissatisfaction with treatment, frequent switching of ADs, and changing care providers are associated with low rates of remission. Residual symptoms remain a challenge that future research must address.", "Most of the current development of artificial intelligence is based on brain cognition, however, this replication of biology cannot simulate the subjective emotional and mental state changes of human beings. Due to the imperfections of existing artificial intelligence, this manuscript summarizes and clarifies that artificial intelligence system combined with cognitive psychology is the research direction of artificial intelligence. It aims to promote the development of artificial intelligence and give computers human advanced cognitive abilities, so that computers can recognize emotions, understand human feelings, and eventually achieve dialog and empathy with humans and other artificial intelligence. This paper emphasizes the development potential and importance of artificial intelligence to understand, possess and discriminate human mental states, and argues its application value with three typical application examples of human-computer interaction: face attraction, affective computing, and music emotion, which is conducive to the further and higher level of artificial intelligence research.", "Online consultations (OCs) allow patients to contact their care providers on the web. Worldwide, OCs have been rolled out in primary care rapidly owing to policy initiatives and COVID-19. There is a lack of evidence regarding how OC design and implementation influence care quality.\nWe aimed to synthesize research on the impacts of OCs on primary care quality, and how these are influenced by system design and implementation.\nWe searched databases from January 2010 to February 2022. We included quantitative and qualitative studies of real-world OC use in primary care. Quantitative data were transformed into qualitative themes. We used thematic synthesis informed by the Institute of Medicine domains of health care quality, and framework analysis informed by the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability framework. Strength of evidence was judged using the GRADE-CERQual approach.\nWe synthesized 63 studies from 9 countries covering 31 OC systems, 14 (22%) of which used artificial intelligence; 41% (26/63) of studies were published from 2020 onward, and 17% (11/63) were published after the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no quantitative evidence for negative impacts of OCs on patient safety, and qualitative studies suggested varied perceptions of their safety. Some participants believed OCs improved safety, particularly when patients could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload decreased when sufficient resources were allocated to implement OCs and patients used them for simple problems or could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload increased when OCs were not integrated with other software or organizational workflows and patients used them for complex queries. OC systems that required patients to describe their queries using multiple-choice questionnaires increased workload for patients and staff. Health costs decreased when patients used OCs for simple queries and increased when patients used them for complex queries. Patients using OCs were more likely to be female, younger, and native speakers, with higher socioeconomic status. OCs increased primary care access for patients with mental health conditions, verbal communication difficulties, and barriers to attending in-person appointments. Access also increased by providing a timely response to patients' queries. Patient satisfaction increased when using OCs owing to better primary care access, although it decreased when using multiple-choice questionnaire formats.\nThis is the first theoretically informed synthesis of research on OCs in primary care and includes studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It contributes new knowledge that, in addition to having positive impacts on care quality such as increased access, OCs also have negative impacts such as increased workload. Negative impacts can be mitigated through appropriate OC system design (eg, free text format), incorporation of advanced technologies (eg, artificial intelligence), and integration into technical infrastructure (eg, software) and organizational workflows (eg, timely responses).\nPROSPERO CRD42020191802; https://tinyurl.com/2p84ezjy.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are expanding in popularity for broad applications to challenging tasks in chemistry and materials science. Examples include the prediction of properties, the discovery of new reaction pathways, or the design of new molecules. The machine needs to read and write fluently in a chemical language for each of these tasks. Strings are a common tool to represent molecular graphs, and the most popular molecular string representation, Smiles, has powered cheminformatics since the late 1980s. However, in the context of AI and ML in chemistry, Smiles has several shortcomings-most pertinently, most combinations of symbols lead to invalid results with no valid chemical interpretation. To overcome this issue, a new language for molecules was introduced in 2020 that guarantees 100% robustness: SELF-referencing embedded string (Selfies). Selfies has since simplified and enabled numerous new applications in chemistry. In this perspective, we look to the future and discuss molecular string representations, along with their respective opportunities and challenges. We propose 16 concrete future projects for robust molecular representations. These involve the extension toward new chemical domains, exciting questions at the interface of AI and robust languages, and interpretability for both humans and machines. We hope that these proposals will inspire several follow-up works exploiting the full potential of molecular string representations for the future of AI in chemistry and materials science.", "The objective of this study is to produce a geo-referenced map of the status of R&D in COVID-related studies in the world.\nSpatial mapping of bibliometric data of Cortellis Drug Discovery Intelligence through a spatial bibliometric model with the aid of a GIS (Geographic Information System) called ArcGIS and the software.\nWe show the countries that have the most studies related to COV ID-19 and their degree of collaboration. No drug discovery-related activity was found in South America and Africa. A geo-referenced map of the most active countries in COVID research was constructed as well as conceptual maps of the 11 most representative drugs employed for COVID treatment.\nThe georeferenced conceptual maps produced in the present report allow not only to better understand the leading institutions in R&D in COVID-19 related drugs but also to visualize their interactions and research relationships. This could offer, in addition to a coherent, organized multinational effort, the possibility of searching for other drugs that have been employed for other diseases and that, in terms of their conceptual relations, could represent some possibilities for treating the coronavirus SARS-2.", "The pioneering nature of this work covers the answers to two questions: (1) Is an up-to-date anatomical model of the larynx needed for modern endoscopic diagnostics, and (2) can such a digital segmentation model be utilized for deep learning purposes. The idea presented in this article has never been proposed before, and this is a breakthrough in numerical approaches to aerodigestive videoendoscopy imaging. The approach described in this article assumes defining a process for data acquisition, integration, and segmentation (labeling), for the needs of a new branch of knowledge: digital medicine and digital diagnosis support expert systems. The first and crucial step of such a process is creating a digital model of the larynx, which has to be then validated utilizing multiple clinical, as well as technical metrics. The model will form the basis for further artificial intelligence (AI) requirements, and it may also contribute to the development of translational medicine.", "Medical artificial intelligence (AI) is important for future health care systems. Research on medical AI has examined people's reluctance to use medical AI from the knowledge, attitude, and behavioral levels in isolation using a variable-centered approach while overlooking the possibility that there are subpopulations of people who may differ in their combined level of knowledge, attitude and behavior. To address this gap in the literature, we adopt a person-centered approach employing latent profile analysis to consider people's medical AI objective knowledge, subjective knowledge, negative attitudes and behavioral intentions. Across two studies, we identified three distinct medical AI profiles that systemically varied according to people's trust in and perceived risk imposed by medical AI. Our results revealed new insights into the nature of people's reluctance to use medical AI and how individuals with different profiles may characteristically have distinct knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding medical AI.", "Everyone is aware that air and environmental pollutants are harmful to health. Among them, indoor air quality directly affects physical health, such as respiratory rather than outdoor air. However, studies that have examined the correlation between environmental and health information have been conducted with public data targeting large cohorts, and studies with real-time data analysis are insufficient. Therefore, this research explores the research with an indoor air quality monitoring (AQM) system based on developing environmental detection sensors and the internet of things to collect, monitor, and analyze environmental and health data from various data sources in real-time. It explores the usage of wearable devices for health monitoring systems. In addition, the availability of big data and artificial intelligence analysis and prediction has increased, investigating algorithmic studies for accurate prediction of hazardous environments and health impacts. Regarding health effects, techniques to prevent respiratory and related diseases were reviewed.", "Nanoscale morphology of functional materials determines their chemical and physical properties. However, despite increasing use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to directly image nanomorphology, it remains challenging to quantify the information embedded in TEM data sets, and to use nanomorphology to link synthesis and processing conditions to properties. We develop an automated, descriptor-free analysis workflow for TEM data that utilizes convolutional neural networks and unsupervised learning to quantify and classify nanomorphology, and thereby reveal synthesis-nanomorphology relationships in three different systems. While TEM records nanomorphology readily in two-dimensional (2D) images or three-dimensional (3D) tomograms, we advance the analysis of these images by identifying and applying a universal shape fingerprint function to characterize nanomorphology. After dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis, this function then serves as the input for morphology grouping through unsupervised learning. We demonstrate the wide applicability of our workflow to both 2D and 3D TEM data sets, and to both inorganic and organic nanomaterials, including tetrahedral gold nanoparticles mixed with irregularly shaped impurities, hybrid polymer-patched gold nanoprisms, and polyamide membranes with irregular and heterogeneous 3D crumple structures. In each of these systems, unsupervised nanomorphology grouping identifies both the diversity and the similarity of the nanomaterial across different synthesis conditions, revealing how synthetic parameters guide nanomorphology development. Our work opens possibilities for enhancing synthesis of nanomaterials through artificial intelligence and for understanding and controlling complex nanomorphology, both for 2D systems and in the far less explored case of 3D structures, such as those with embedded voids or hidden interfaces.", "Trendy technologies, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) are being increasingly used for hearing loss, tinnitus, and vestibular disease. Thus, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the possible benefits of the use of VR and AR technologies in patients with hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or vestibular dysfunction, with the aim of suggesting potential applications of these technologies for both researchers and clinicians.\nPublished articles from 1968 to 2022 were gathered from six electronic journal databases. Applying our specified inclusion and/or exclusion criteria, 23 studies were analyzed. As only one article on hearing loss and two articles on tinnitus were found, 20 studies on vestibular dysfunction were only finally included for the meta-analysis. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were chosen as estimates to compare the studies. A funnel plot and Egger's regression analysis were used to identify any risk of bias.\nHigh heterogeneity (I2: 83%, \u03c42: 0.5431, p<0.01) was identified across the studies on vestibular dysfunction. VR-based rehabilitation was significantly effective for individuals with vestibular disease (SMDs: 0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.08 to 0.15, p<0.05). A subgroup analysis revealed that only improvement in the subjective questionnaire was meaningful and statistically significant (SMDs: -0.66, 95% CI: -1.10 to -0.22).\nVR-based vestibular rehabilitation showed potential for subjective rating measures like Dizziness Handicap Index. The negative effect of aging on vestibular disease was indirectly confirmed. More clinical trials and an evidence-based approach are needed to confirm the implementation of state-of-the-art technology for hearing loss and tinnitus, representative diseases in neurotology.", "Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep machine learning have created a step change in how to measure human development indicators, in particular asset-based poverty. The combination of satellite imagery and deep machine learning now has the capability to estimate some types of poverty at a level close to what is achieved with traditional household surveys. An increasingly important issue beyond static estimations is whether this technology can contribute to scientific discovery and, consequently, new knowledge in the poverty and welfare domain. A foundation for achieving scientific insights is domain knowledge, which in turn translates into explainability and scientific consistency. We perform an integrative literature review focusing on three core elements relevant in this context-transparency, interpretability, and explainability-and investigate how they relate to the poverty, machine learning, and satellite imagery nexus. Our inclusion criteria for papers are that they cover poverty/wealth prediction, using survey data as the basis for the ground truth poverty/wealth estimates, be applicable to both urban and rural settings, use satellite images as the basis for at least some of the inputs (features), and the method should include deep neural networks. Our review of 32 papers shows that the status of the three core elements of explainable machine learning (transparency, interpretability, and domain knowledge) is varied and does not completely fulfill the requirements set up for scientific insights and discoveries. We argue that explainability is essential to support wider dissemination and acceptance of this research in the development community and that explainability means more than just interpretability.", "Existing research has linked emotional intelligence (EI) with intrinsic emotion regulation (processes people use to regulate their own emotions). However, there has not yet been an empirical examination of whether EI abilities relate to extrinsic emotion regulation (processes people use to regulate other people's emotions). This study (N = 178 undergraduates) examines whether ability EI (as measured by the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test) correlates with eight extrinsic regulation processes (as measured by the Regulation of Others' Emotions Scale, including downward comparison, expressive suppression, humour, distraction, direct action, reappraisal, receptive listening and valuing). Total ability EI score is significantly positively correlated with three high-engagement processes (r = .24, .40, and .16 for reappraisal, receptive listening, and valuing) and negatively correlated with two low-engagement processes (r = -.30 and -.38 for downward comparison and expressive suppression). When all four EI branches predicted each regulation process in multiple regression, only emotion management significantly predicted downward comparison, receptive listening and valuing, and only emotion management and understanding predicted expressive suppression (no significant regression coefficients for reappraisal). We conclude that the drivers of EI/extrinsic regulation associations are engagement with the target's emotion and the emotion management branch of EI.", "While in task orientation, athletes tend to compare themselves to others in order to evaluate their success, in ego orientation athletes have the ability to distinguish between effort and ability and the comparison is made with others in order to evaluate success. The purpose of this study was to inspect the relationship concerning the three dimensions of emotional intelligence (attention, clarity, and emotional regulation) and the two predominant motivational orientations: task-oriented motivation and ego-oriented motivation. The sample was composed of a total of 165 university students from studies within the field of sciences related to sport and physical activity. The main contributions of this research demonstrate the correspondence between emotional intelligence and ego-orientation.", "This essay examines the state of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technology applications in healthcare and the impact they have on the industry. This study comprised a detailed review of the literature and analyzed real-world examples of AI applications in healthcare. The findings show that major hospitals use AI-based technology to enhance knowledge and skills of their healthcare professionals for patient diagnosis and treatment. AI systems have also been shown to improve the efficiency and management of hospitals\u00b4 nursing and managerial functions. Healthcare providers are positively accepting AI in multiple arenas. However, its applications offer both the utopian (new opportunities) as well as the dystopian (challenges). Unlike pessimists, AI should not be seen a potential source of \"Digital Dictatorship\" in future of 22nd century. To provide a balanced view on the potential and challenges of AI in healthcare, we discuss these details. It is evident that AI and related technologies are rapidly evolving and will allow care providers to create new value for patients and improve their operational efficiency. Effective AI applications will require planning and strategies that transform both the care service and the operations in order to reap the benefits.", "The mechanical adaptive material is a kind of functional material that can effectively dissipate energy and suppress the increase of its stress under continuous strain in a large deformation area, which are vital in artificial muscles, connection devices, soft artificial intelligence robots, and other areas. Scientists have been working to broaden the platform of the material's mechanical adaptive platform and improve its mechanical strength by specific structure design. Based on it, we expect to introduce a mechanism of energy dissipation from the molecular chain scale to further improve mechanical adaptability. We developed a liquid crystal-modified polydimethylsiloxane rubber with mechanical adaptability based on chain extension in the process of crosslinking. Results showed that liquid crystal (0.7 mol %)-modified silicone rubber can obviously dissipate energy to achieve mechanical adaptive function, and the energy dissipation ratio of polydimethylsiloxane rubber (MQ), 4-propyl-4'-vinyl-1,1'-bi(cyclohexane)-modified polydimethylsiloxane rubber (3CCV-MQ), and 4-methoxyphenyl-4-(3-butenyloxy) benzoate-modified polydimethylsiloxane rubber (MBB-MQ) gradually decreases from 30 to 24%. Excessive thiol groups of liquid crystal-modified polydimethylsiloxane react with its vinyl group to achieve the chain extension, which significantly improves the mechanical strength from 2.74 to 5.83 MPa and elongation at break from 733 to 1096%. This research offers some new insights into improving the mechanical strength of silicone rubber and is of great significance for the application of the mechanical adaptive material.", "Widespread generation and analysis of omics data have revolutionized molecular medicine on Earth, yet its power to yield new mechanistic insights and improve occupational health during spaceflight is still to be fully realized in humans. Nevertheless, rapid technological advancements and ever-regular spaceflight programs mean that longitudinal, standardized, and cost-effective collection of human space omics data are firmly within reach. Here, we consider the practicality and scientific return of different sampling methods and omic types in the context of human spaceflight. We also appraise ethical and legal considerations pertinent to omics data derived from European astronauts and spaceflight participants (SFPs). Ultimately, we propose that a routine omics collection program in spaceflight and analog environments presents a golden opportunity. Unlocking this bright future of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analyses and personalized medicine approaches will require further investigation into best practices, including policy design and standardization of omics data, metadata, and sampling methods.", "The widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) programs during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the exact volume of lung tissue damage has allowed them to train a large number of radiologists. The simplicity of the program for determining the volume of the affected lung tissue in acute interstitial pneumonia, which has density indicators in the range from -200 HU to -730 HU, which includes the density indicators of \"ground glass\" and reticulation (the main radiation patterns in COVID-19) allows you to accurately determine the degree of prevalence process. The characteristics of chronic interstitial pneumonia, which are progressive in nature, fit into the same density framework. \u0410im.

unique capabilities and opened new directions in research, such as creating new states of matter or directly measuring atomic motion. One such area is the ability to use finely spaced sets of coherent x-ray pulses to be compared after scattering from a dynamic system at different times. This enables the study of fluctuations in many-body quantum systems at the level of the ultrafast pulse durations, but this method has been limited to a select number of examples and required complex and advanced analytical tools. By applying a new methodology to this problem, we have made qualitative advances in three separate areas that will likely also find application to new fields. As compared to the \"droplet-type\" models, which typically are used to estimate the photon distributions on pixelated detectors to obtain the coherent x-ray speckle patterns, our algorithm achieves an order of magnitude speedup on CPU hardware and two orders of magnitude improvement on GPU hardware. We also find that it retains accuracy in low-contrast conditions, which is the typical regime for many experiments in structural dynamics. Finally, it can predict photon distributions in high average-intensity applications, a regime which up until now has not been accessible. Our artificial intelligence-assisted algorithm will enable a wider adoption of x-ray coherence spectroscopies, by both automating previously challenging analyses and enabling new experiments that were not otherwise feasible without the developments described in this work.", "Background: In the biotechnology and applied microbiology sectors, artificial intelligence (AI) has been extensively used in disease diagnostics, drug research and development, functional genomics, biomarker recognition, and medical imaging diagnostics. In our study, from 2000 to 2021, science publications focusing on AI in biotechnology were reviewed, and quantitative, qualitative, and modeling analyses were performed. Methods: On 6 May 2022, the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) was screened for AI applications in biotechnology and applied microbiology; 3,529 studies were identified between 2000 and 2022, and analyzed. The following information was collected: publication, country or region, references, knowledgebase, institution, keywords, journal name, and research hotspots, and examined using VOSviewer and CiteSpace V bibliometric platforms. Results: We showed that 128 countries published articles related to AI in biotechnology and applied microbiology; the United States had the most publications. In addition, 584 global institutions contributed to publications, with the Chinese Academy of Science publishing the most. Reference clusters from studies were categorized into ten headings: deep learning, prediction, support vector machines (SVM), object detection, feature representation, synthetic biology, amyloid, human microRNA precursors, systems biology, and single cell RNA-Sequencing. Research frontier keywords were represented by microRNA (2012-2020) and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) (2012-2020). Conclusion: We systematically, objectively, and comprehensively analyzed AI-related biotechnology and applied microbiology literature, and additionally, identified current hot spots and future trends in this area. Our review provides researchers with a comprehensive overview of the dynamic evolution of AI in biotechnology and applied microbiology and identifies future key research areas.", "Compared with traditional manual inspection, inspection robots can not only meet the all-weather, real-time, and accurate inspection needs of substation inspection, they also reduce the work intensity of operation and maintenance personnel and decrease the probability of safety accidents. For the urgent demand of substation inspection robot intelligence enhancement, an environment understanding algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is an improved DeepLab V3+ neural network. The improved neural network replaces the original dilate rate combination in the ASPP (atrous spatial pyramid pooling) module with a new dilate rate combination with better segmentation accuracy of object edges and adds a CBAM (convolutional block attention module) in the two up-samplings, respectively. In order to be transplanted to the embedded platform with limited computing resources, the improved neural network is compressed. Multiple sets of comparative experiments on the standard dataset PASCAL VOC 2012 and the substation dataset have been made. Experimental results show that, compared with the DeepLab V3+, the improved DeepLab V3+ has a mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) of eight categories of 57.65% on the substation dataset, with an improvement of 6.39%, and the model size of 13.9 M, with a decrease of 147.1 M.", "With the arrival of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, humidity sensors monitoring water emissions from human metabolism have attracted great attention in the fields of smart wearable devices and noncontact human-machine interaction. However, their application is seriously limited by the trade-off between the sensitivity and response speed for traditional humidity sensors. Herein, to overcome it, a self-powered high performance humidity sensor is developed on the basis of the electric-poled and oxygen vacancy-rich BiFeO3 (BFO) ferroelectric material. The synergistic effect of ferroelectric polarization and oxygen vacancy provides a strong driving force and active adsorption sites for an abundance of OH/H2O adsorption, resulting in an ultrahigh response (\u223c104) and ultrafast response/recovery speed (\u223c84/376 ms). Benefiting from its promising advantages, the wearable humidity sensor can accurately record the respiration rate/depth and recognize different human respiratory behaviors in real-time. Importantly, by utilizing the moisture from mouth-blowing and skin, the sensors are successfully applied to noncontact control of a robotic car, noncontact switch, and noncontact interface for visualization applications. This work provides an effective strategy for developing excellent humidity sensors that meet the requirement of noncontact interaction for next-generation intelligent electronics.", "Splenic hemangiosarcoma has morphological similarities to benign nodular hyperplasia. Computed tomography (CT) texture analysis can analyze the texture of images that the naive human eye cannot detect. Recently, there have been attempts to incorporate CT texture analysis with artificial intelligence in human medicine. This retrospective, analytical design study aimed to assess the feasibility of CT texture analysis in splenic masses and investigate predictive biomarkers of splenic hemangiosarcoma in dogs. Parameters for dogs with hemangiosarcoma and nodular hyperplasia were compared, and an independent parameter that could differentiate between them was selected. Discriminant analysis was performed to assess the ability to discriminate the two splenic masses and compare the relative importance of the parameters. A total of 23 dogs were sampled, including 16 splenic nodular hyperplasia and seven hemangiosarcoma. In each dog, total 38 radiomic parameters were extracted from first-, second-, and higher-order matrices. Thirteen parameters had significant differences between hemangiosarcoma and nodular hyperplasia. Skewness in the first-order matrix and GLRLM_LGRE and GLZLM_ZLNU in the second, higher-order matrix were determined as independent parameters. A discriminant equation consisting of skewness, GLZLM_LGZE, and GLZLM_ZLNU was derived, and the cross-validation verification result showed an accuracy of 95.7%. Skewness was the most influential parameter for the discrimination of the two masses. The study results supported using CT texture analysis to help differentiate hemangiosarcoma from nodular hyperplasia in dogs. This new diagnostic approach can be used for developing future machine learning-based texture analysis tools.", "The most essential process in statistical image and signal processing is the parameter estimation of probability density functions (PDFs). The estimation of the probability density functions is a contentious issue in the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The study examines challenges related to estimating density functions from random variables. Based on minimal predictions regarding densities, the study discusses a framework for evaluating probability density functions. During the Bayesian approach, which is to generate correct samplings that reflect the probability aspect of the variables, sampling is widely used to estimate as well as define the probabilistic model of unknown variables. Because of its effectiveness and extensive application, the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method has earned the most popularity among the various methodologies. The Bayesian technique allows parameters of the model to be estimated using prior expertise in the parameter results and experimental observations. The study uses a number of engineering issues that were lately looked into to illustrate the effectiveness of the upgraded GLUE. As the focus is on the examination of sampling effectiveness in view of engineering components, only a brief summary is provided to describe every challenge. The suggested GLUE method's outcomes are contrasted with those obtained using MCMC. Nevertheless, using the GLUE approach, the model's mean squared error of prediction is substantially higher than that of the previous algorithms. The methods' results are affected by the assumptions being made on parameter values in advance. The concepts of prediction accuracy, as well as the utility of geometric testing, are presented. Such notions are valuable in demonstrating that the GLUE approach defines an inconsistent and incoherent statistical inference process.", "Plants contribute significantly to the global food supply. Various Plant diseases can result in production losses, which can be avoided by maintaining vigilance. However, manually monitoring plant diseases by agriculture experts and botanists is time-consuming, challenging and error-prone. To reduce the risk of disease severity, machine vision technology (i.e., artificial intelligence) can play a significant role. In the alternative method, the severity of the disease can be diminished through computer technologies and the cooperation of humans. These methods can also eliminate the disadvantages of manual observation. In this work, we proposed a solution to detect tomato plant disease using a deep leaning-based system utilizing the plant leaves image data. We utilized an architecture for deep learning based on a recently developed convolutional neural network that is trained over 18,161 segmented and non-segmented tomato leaf images-using a supervised learning approach to detect and recognize various tomato diseases using the Inception Net model in the research work. For the detection and segmentation of disease-affected regions, two state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models, i.e., U-Net and Modified U-Net, are utilized in this work. The plant leaf pixels are binary and classified by the model as Region of Interest (ROI) and background. There is also an examination of the presentation of binary arrangement (healthy and diseased leaves), six-level classification (healthy and other ailing leaf groups), and ten-level classification (healthy and other types of ailing leaves) models. The Modified U-net segmentation model outperforms the simple U-net segmentation model by 98.66 percent, 98.5 IoU score, and 98.73 percent on the dice. InceptionNet1 achieves 99.95% accuracy for binary classification problems and 99.12% for classifying six segmented class images; InceptionNet outperformed the Modified U-net model to achieve higher accuracy. The experimental results of our proposed method for classifying plant diseases demonstrate that it outperforms the methods currently available in the literature.", "An Artificial Intelligence algorithm trained on data that reflect racial biases may yield racially biased outputs, even if the algorithm on its own is unbiased. For example, algorithms used to schedule medical appointments in the USA predict that Black patients are at a higher risk of no-show than non-Black patients, though technically accurate given existing data that prediction results in Black patients being overwhelmingly scheduled in appointment slots that cause longer wait times than non-Black patients. This perpetuates racial inequity, in this case lesser access to medical care. This gives rise to one type of Accuracy-Fairness trade-off: preserve the efficiency offered by using AI to schedule appointments or discard that efficiency in order to avoid perpetuating ethno-racial disparities. Similar trade-offs arise in a range of AI applications including others in medicine, as well as in education, judicial systems, and public security, among others. This article presents a framework for addressing such trade-offs where Machine Learning and Optimization components of the algorithm are decoupled. Applied to medical appointment scheduling, our framework articulates four approaches intervening in different ways on different components of the algorithm. Each yields specific results, in one case preserving accuracy comparable to the current state-of-the-art while eliminating the disparity.", "In the recent past, the agricultural industry has rapidly digitalized in the form of smart farms through the broad usage of data analysis and artificial intelligence. Commonly, high operating costs in a smart farm are primarily due to inefficient energy usage. Therefore, accurate estimation of agricultural energy usage and environmental factors is considered as one of the significant tasks for crop growth control. The growth sequences of crops in agricultural environments like smart farms are related to agricultural energy usage and consumption. This study aims to develop and validate an algorithm that can interpret the crop growth rate response to environmental and solar energy factors based on machine learning, and to evaluate the algorithm's accuracy compared to the base model. The proposed model was determined through a comparative experiment of three representative machine learning techniques, which are random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and gradient boosting machine (GBM), considering the energy usage for environmental control is highly associated with the paprika crop growth. Through the experiment performance with real data gathered from a paprika smart farm in South Korea, the multi-level RF can effectively predict paprika growth with an accuracy of 0.88, considering data analysis of factors that use solar energy. As a result of the experiment with the suggested model, the growth factors such as leaf length, leaf width, and environmental factors were found. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can contribute to the development of applications through analysis of the crop growth big data for various plants in agricultural environments such as a smart farm.", "The use of computed tomography (CT) in fractures is time consuming, challenging and suffers from poor inter-surgeon reliability. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), may overcome shortcomings and reduce clinical burdens to detect and classify fractures. The aim of this review was to summarize literature on CNNs for the detection and classification of fractures on CT scans, focusing on its accuracy and to evaluate the beneficial role in daily practice.\nLiterature search was performed according to the PRISMA statement, and Embase, Medline ALL, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Google Scholar databases were searched. Studies were eligible when the use of AI for the detection of fractures on CT scans was described. Quality assessment was done with a modified version of the methodologic index for nonrandomized studies (MINORS), with a seven-item checklist. Performance of AI was defined as accuracy, F1-score and area under the curve (AUC).\nOf the 1140 identified studies, 17 were included. Accuracy ranged from 69 to 99%, the F1-score ranged from 0.35 to 0.94 and the AUC, ranging from 0.77 to 0.95. Based on ten studies, CNN showed a similar or improved diagnostic accuracy in addition to clinical evaluation only.\nCNNs are applicable for the detection and classification fractures on CT scans. This can improve automated and clinician-aided diagnostics. Further research should focus on the additional value of CNN used for CT scans in daily clinics.", "Neonatal care in middle-income countries has improved over the last decade, leading to a \"third epidemic\" of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Without concomitant improvements in ROP screening infrastructure, reduction of ROP-associated visual loss remains a challenge worldwide. The emergence of teleophthalmology screening programs and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies represents promising methods to address this growing unmet demand in ROP screening. An improved understanding of current ROP screening programs may inform the adoption of these novel technologies in ROP care.\nA critical narrative review of the literature was carried out. Publications that were representative of established or emerging ROP screening programs in high-, middle-, and low-income countries were selected for review. Screening programs were reviewed for inclusion criteria, screening frequency and duration, modality, and published sensitivity and specificity.\nScreening inclusion criteria, including age and birth weight cutoffs, showed significant heterogeneity globally. Countries of similar income tend to have similar criteria. Three primary screening modalities including binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy (BIO), wide-field digital retinal imaging (WFDRI), and teleophthalmology were identified and reviewed. BIO has documented limitations in reduced interoperator agreement, scalability, and geographical access barriers, which are mitigated in part by WFDRI. Teleophthalmology screening may address limitations in ROP screening workforce distribution and training. Opportunities for AI technologies were identified in the context of these limitations, including interoperator reliability and possibilities for point-of-care diagnosis.\nLimitations in the current ROP screening include scalability, geographical access, and high screening burden with low treatment yield. These may be addressable through increased adoption of teleophthalmology and AI technologies. As the global incidence of ROP continues to increase, implementation of these novel modalities requires greater consideration.", "Contrary to popular belief, the cerebellum is involved not only in motor planning, balance, and coordination but also in cognitive processes. The present study aimed to investigate executive functions (EFs), intellectual capacity, and psychiatric disorders in adults with type 1 Chiari malformation, which is defined as a hindbrain anomaly that involves the cerebellum.\nThe study included 62 adults, with 29 in the CM group and 33 in the control group. EFs were evaluated using the Stroop test, number sequence learning test, and standardized mini-mental state examination (SMMSE). The intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured using the Kent EGY and Porteus maze tests, and psychiatric disorders were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, Clinician Version (DSM-5-CV).\nThe CM group took longer than the control to complete the Stroop test for each section (P\u00a0<\u00a00.005). Although the mean IQ scores of both groups were within the normal range, the CM group had a lower mean IQ score than the control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.005). Although the mean SMMSE scores of both groups were within the normal range, the CM group had a lower mean SMMSE score than the control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.005). The CM group had a higher rate of psychiatric comorbidities than the control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.005).\nThe study found that subjects with type 1 Chiari malformation performed worse in EFs than healthy controls and had a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders.", "Despite the substantial heritability of antisocial behavior (ASB), specific genetic variants robustly associated with the trait have not been identified. The present study by the Broad Antisocial Behavior Consortium (BroadABC) meta-analyzed data from 28 discovery samples (N\u2009=\u200985,359) and five independent replication samples (N\u2009=\u20098058) with genotypic data and broad measures of ASB. We identified the first significant genetic associations with broad ASB, involving common intronic variants in the forkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) gene (lead SNP rs12536335, p\u2009=\u20096.32\u2009\u00d7\u200910-10). Furthermore, we observed intronic variation in Foxp2 and one of its targets (Cntnap2) distinguishing a mouse model of pathological aggression (BALB/cJ strain) from controls (BALB/cByJ strain). Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses in independent samples revealed that the genetic risk for ASB was associated with several antisocial outcomes across the lifespan, including diagnosis of conduct disorder, official criminal convictions, and trajectories of antisocial development. We found substantial genetic correlations of ASB with mental health (depression rg\u2009=\u20090.63, insomnia rg\u2009=\u20090.47), physical health (overweight rg\u2009=\u20090.19, waist-to-hip ratio rg\u2009=\u20090.32), smoking (rg\u2009=\u20090.54), cognitive ability (intelligence rg\u2009=\u2009-0.40), educational attainment (years of schooling rg\u2009=\u2009-0.46) and reproductive traits (age at first birth rg\u2009=\u2009-0.58, father's age at death rg\u2009=\u2009-0.54). Our findings provide a starting point toward identifying critical biosocial risk mechanisms for the development of ASB.", "Stress, depression, and anxiety are a person's physiological states that emerge from various body features such as speech, body language, eye contact, facial expression, etc. Physiological emotion is a part of human life and is associated with psychological activities. Sad emotion is relatable to negative thoughts and recognized in three stages containing stress, anxiety, and depression. These stages of Physiological emotion show various common and distinguished symptoms. The present study explores stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms in student life. The study reviews the psychological features generated through various body parts to identify psychological activities. Environmental factors, including a daily routine, greatly trigger psychological activities. The psychological disorder may affect mental and physical health adversely. The correct recognition of such disorder is expensive and time-consuming as it requires accurate datasets of symptoms. In the present study, an attempt has been made to investigate the effectiveness of computerized automated techniques that include machine learning algorithms for identifying stress, anxiety, and depression mental disorder. The proposed paper reviews the machine learning-based algorithms applied over datasets containing questionnaires, audio, video, etc., to recognize sad details. During the review process, the proposed study found that artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are well recommended and widely utilized in most of the existing literature for measuring psychological disorders. The various machine learning-based algorithms are applied over datasets containing questionnaires, audio, video, etc., to recognize sad details. There has been continuous monitoring for the body symptoms established in the various existing literature to identify psychological states. The present review reveals the study of excellence and competence of machine learning techniques in detecting psychological disorders' stress, depression, and anxiety parameters. This paper shows a systematic review of some existing computer vision-based models with their merits and demerits.", "To describe the development of social function in children with cerebral palsy (CP) classified in all levels of the Communication Function Classification System (CFCS).\nThis prospective, longitudinal population-based cohort study recruited children with CP born in Queensland, Australia. Social functioning was measured using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) social function domain at 2\u2009years, 2\u2009years 6\u2009months, 3\u2009years, 4\u2009years, and 5\u2009years, and the PEDI Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI-CAT) social/cognitive domain at 8 to 12\u2009years.\nSeventy-four children provided 356 observations. PEDI-CAT social/cognitive scaled scores at 8 to 12\u2009years were (mean [SD] n) CFCS level I, 68.6 (2.7) 45; CFCS level II, 64.0 (3.4) 10; CFCS level III, 63.5 (3.7) 4; CFCS level IV, 56.8 (5.0) 9; CFCS level V, 47.2 (5.8) 6. Scores within expected range for age (not less than 2 SD below mean) at 8 to 12\u2009years were achieved by 35 (78%) children in CFCS level I and four (14%) in CFCS levels II to V. Forty-nine per cent of children scored at least two standard deviations below the population mean on a proxy measure of fluid intelligence. Intellectual impairment was associated with lower PEDI-CAT social/cognitive scaled scores in univariable analysis (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-8.3, 95%\u00a0confidence interval\u2009-\u200910.91 to -5.63; p\u2009<\u20090.001) but had a smaller effect when modelled together with CFCS.\nSocial function attained by 8 to 12\u2009years of age was strongly related to level of communication function (CFCS). The small number of children classified in CFCS levels II to V necessitates caution when viewing these individual CFCS level trajectories.\nThere is a strong relation between social functioning and Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) levels. At 8 to 12\u2009years, 35 out of 45 children in CFCS level I met social functioning age expectations. Twenty-five out of 29 in CFCS levels II to V had social functioning below that expected for age. CFCS and age were more strongly associated with development of social functioning than Gross Motor Function Classification System or Manual Ability Classification System and age.", "Background Computational models based on artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly used to diagnose malignant breast lesions. However, assessment from radiologic images of the specific pathologic lesion subtypes, as detailed in the results of biopsy procedures, remains a challenge. Purpose To develop an AI-based model to identify breast lesion subtypes with mammograms and linked electronic health records labeled with histopathologic information. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 26\u2009569 images were collected in 9234 women who underwent digital mammography to pretrain the algorithms. The training data included individuals who had at least 1 year of clinical and imaging history followed by biopsy-based histopathologic diagnosis from March 2013 to November 2018. A model that combined convolutional neural networks with supervised learning algorithms was independently trained to make breast lesion predictions with data from 2120 women in Israel and 1642 women in the United States. Results were reported using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with the 95% DeLong approach to estimate CIs. Significance was tested with bootstrapping. Results The Israeli model was validated in 456 women and tested in 441 women (mean age, 51 years \u00b1 11 [SD]). The U.S. model was validated in 350 women and tested in 344 women (mean age, 60 years \u00b1 12). For predicting malignancy in the test sets (consisting of 220 Israeli patient examinations and 126 U.S. patient examinations with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive cancer), the algorithms obtained an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.91) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.85) for Israeli and U.S. patients, respectively (P = .006). These results may not hold for other cohorts of patients, and generalizability across populations should be further investigated. Conclusion The results offer supporting evidence that artificial intelligence applied to clinical and mammographic images can identify breast lesion subtypes when the data are sufficiently large, which may help assess diagnostic workflow and reduce biopsy sampling errors.

Fetus Framework was trained and tested on a dataset of 1528 2D sagittal-view ultrasound images from 1519 females collected from Shenzhen People's Hospital. Results from Fetus Framework were further used for standard/non-standard (S-NS) plane classification, a key step for NT measurement and Down Syndrome assessment. S-NS classification was also tested with 156 images from the Longhua branch of Shenzhen People's Hospital. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were evaluated for comparison among Fetus Framework, three classic DL models, and human experts with 1-, 3- and 5-year ultrasound training. Furthermore, 4 physicians with more than 5 years of experience conducted a reader study of diagnosing fetal malformation on a dataset of 316 standard images confirmed by the Fetus framework and another dataset of 316 standard images selected by physicians. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-Score of physicians' diagnosis on both sets are compared.\nNine intracranial structures identified by Fetus Framework in validation are all consistent with that of senior radiologists. For S-NS sagittal view identification, Fetus Framework achieved an AUC of 0.996 (95%CI: 0.987, 1.000) in internal test, at par with classic DL models. In external test, FF reaches an AUC of 0.974 (95%CI: 0.952, 0.995), while ResNet-50 arrives at AUC\u223c0.883, 95% CI 0.828-0.939, Xception AUC\u223c0.890, 95% CI 0.834-0.946, and DenseNet-121 AUC\u223c0.894, 95% CI 0.839-0.949. For the internal test set, the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed framework are (0.905, 1), while the first-, third-, and fifth-year clinicians are (0.619, 0.986), (0.690, 0.958), and (0.798, 0.986), respectively. For the external test set, the sensitivity and specificity of FF is (0.989, 0.797), and first-, third-, and fifth-year clinicians are (0.533, 0.875), (0.609, 0.844), and (0.663, 0.781), respectively.On the fetal malformation classification task, all physicians achieved higher accuracy and F1-Score on Fetus selected standard images with statistical significance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).\nWe proposed a new deep learning-based Fetus Framework for identifying key fetus intracranial structures. The framework was tested on data from two different medical centers. The results show consistency and improvement from classic models and human experts in standard and non-standard sagittal view classification during pregnancy week 11-13+6.\nWith further refinement in larger population, the proposed model can improve the efficiency and accuracy of early pregnancy test using ultrasound examination.", "Diabetic macular edema (DME) is one of the leading causes of visual impairment in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Physicians rely on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and baseline visual acuity (VA) to tailor therapeutic regimen. However, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from chart-based examinations may not wholly reflect DME status. Chart-based examinations are subjected findings dependent on the patient's recognition functions and are often confounded by concurrent corneal, lens, retinal, optic nerve, or extraocular disorders. The ability to infer VA from objective optical coherence tomography (OCT) images provides the predicted VA from objective macular structures directly and a better understanding of diabetic macular health. Deviations from chart-based and artificial intelligence (AI) image-based VA will prompt physicians to assess other ocular abnormalities affecting the patients VA and whether pursuing anti-VEGF treatment will likely yield increment in VA.\nWe enrolled a retrospective cohort of 251 DME patients from Big Data Center (BDC) of Taipei Veteran General Hospital (TVGH) from February 2011 and August 2019. A total of 3,920 OCT images, labeled as \"visually impaired\" or \"adequate\" according to baseline VA, were grouped into training (2,826), validation (779), and testing cohort (315). We applied confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the performance.\nWe developed an OCT-based convolutional neuronal network (CNN) model that could classify two VA classes by the threshold of 0.50 (decimal notation) with an accuracy of 75.9%, a sensitivity of 78.9%, and an area under the ROC curve of 80.1% on the testing cohort.\nThis study demonstrated the feasibility of inferring VA from routine objective retinal images.\nServes as a pilot study to encourage further use of deep learning in deriving functional outcomes and secondary surrogate endpoints for retinal diseases.", "The world we live in has been taken quite surprisingly by the outbreak of a novel virus namely SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 i.e. the disease associated with the virus, has not only shaken the world economy due to enforced lockdown but has also saturated the public health care systems of even most advanced countries due to its exponential spread. The fight against COVID-19 pandemic will continue until majority of world's population get vaccinated or herd immunity is achieved. Many researchers have exploited the Artificial intelligence (AI) knacks based IoT architecture for early detection and monitoring of potential COVID-19 cases to control the transmission of the virus. However, the main cause of the spread is that people infected with COVID-19 do not show any symptoms and are asymptomatic but can still transmit virus to the masses. Researcher have introduced contact tracing applications to automatically detect contacts that can be infected by the index case. However, these fully automated contact tracing apps have not been accepted due to issues like privacy and cross-app compatibility. In the current study, an IoT based COVID-19 detection and monitoring system with semi-automated and improved contact tracing capability namely COVICT has been presented with application of real-time data of symptoms collected from individuals and contact tracing. The deployment of COVICT, the prediction of infected persons can be made more effective and contaminated areas can be identified to mitigate the further propagation of the virus by imposing Smart Lockdown. The proposed IoT based architecture can be quite helpful for regulatory authorities for policy making to fight COVID-19.", "The ability, will, and belief that it is possible to deal effectively with members of other cultural/ethnic groups are still gaining importance all over the world. However, the majority of studies on intercultural relations focus on Western Europe and the USA, applying constructs and theories that replicate a western-centered worldview. As a consequence, it is unclear whether established measures for intergroup attitudes and intercultural competence may be applied in Eastern European countries and to what extent they display comparable ideas, thoughts, and feelings. The current study thus explores cross-cultural commonalities and differences in established measures of ethnic identity, prejudice, acculturation strategies, intercultural intelligence, and multicultural personality. Therefore, we compare the scale structure, difficulty, and sensitivity in samples from Germany and the Eastern European countries Hungary, Serbia, and the Czech Republic (etic-perspective), as well as the culture-specific conceptions of said concepts (emic-perspective). Results show that the investigated scales do not work comparably across German and Eastern European samples. Differences might be rooted in variations of underlying thinking patterns and connotations of single expressions. Those variations are likely to be related to the constant individual societal and historical developments of cultures, shaping the way individuals think and talk about cultural diversity. Future studies are encouraged to consider culture-specific and generalizable aspects of constructs when conducting cross-cultural research on intercultural relations.", "On encountering a stranger, we spontaneously attribute to them character traits (e.g., trustworthiness, intelligence) based on their facial appearance. Participants can base impressions on structural face cues-the stable aspects of facial appearance that support identity recognition-or expression cues, such as the presence of a smile. It has been reported that 6- to 8-month-old infants attend to faces that adults judge to be trustworthy in preference to faces judged untrustworthy. These results are striking because the face stimuli employed were ostensibly emotion neutral. Consequently, these preferential looking effects have been taken as evidence for innate sensitivity to structural face cues to trustworthiness. However, scrutiny of the emotion rating procedure used with adults suggests that the face stimuli employed may have been judged emotion neutral only when interleaved with more obvious examples of facial affect. This means that the faces may vary in emotional expression when compared to each other. Here, we report new evidence obtained from adult raters that the stimuli used in these studies confound trustworthiness and untrustworthiness with the presence of happiness and anger, respectively. These findings suggest that the preferential looking effects described in infants are compatible with a preference for positive facial affect and may not reflect early sensitivity to structural face cues to trustworthiness.", "As the most aggressive tumor, the outcome of pancreatic cancer (PACA) has not improved observably over the last decade. Anatomy-based TNM staging does not exactly identify treatment-sensitive patients, and an ideal biomarker is urgently needed for precision medicine. Based on expression files of 1280 patients from 10 multicenter cohorts, we screened 32 consensus prognostic genes. Ten machine-learning algorithms were transformed into 76 combinations, of which we selected the optimal algorithm to construct an artificial intelligence-derived prognostic signature (AIDPS) according to the average C-index in the nine testing cohorts. The results of the training cohort, nine testing cohorts, Meta-Cohort, and three external validation cohorts (290 patients) consistently indicated that AIDPS could accurately predict the prognosis of PACA. After incorporating several vital clinicopathological features and 86 published signatures, AIDPS exhibited robust and dramatically superior predictive capability. Moreover, in other prevalent digestive system tumors, the nine-gene AIDPS could still accurately stratify the prognosis. Of note, our AIDPS had important clinical implications for PACA, and patients with low AIDPS owned a dismal prognosis, higher genomic alterations, and denser immune cell infiltrates as well as were more sensitive to immunotherapy. Meanwhile, the high AIDPS group possessed observably prolonged survival, and panobinostat may be a potential agent for patients with high AIDPS. Overall, our study provides an attractive tool to further guide the clinical management and individualized treatment of PACA.", "The purpose of this narrative review is to describe the clinical applications of advanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MRI) techniques in patients affected by Crohn's disease (CD), giving insights about the added value of artificial intelligence (AI) in this field.\nWe performed a literature search comparing standardized and advanced imaging techniques for CD diagnosis. Cross-sectional imaging is essential for the identification of lesions, the assessment of active or relapsing disease and the evaluation of complications.\nThe studies reviewed show that new advanced imaging techniques and new MRI sequences could be integrated into standard protocols, to achieve a reliable quantification of CD activity, improve the lesions' characterization and the evaluation of therapy response. These promising tools are: dual-energy CT (DECT) post-processing techniques, diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI-MRI), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), Magnetization Transfer MRI (MT-MRI) and CINE-MRI. Furthermore, AI solutions show a potential when applied to radiological techniques in these patients. Machine learning (ML) algorithms and radiomic features prove to be useful in improving the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians and in attempting a personalized medicine approach, stratifying patients by predicting their prognosis.\nAdvanced imaging is crucial in the diagnosis, lesions' characterisation and in the estimation of the abdominal involvement in CD. New AI developments are promising tools that could support doctors in the management of CD affected patients.", "This ESGE Position Statement defines the expected value of artificial intelligence (AI) for the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal neoplasia within the framework of the performance measures already defined by ESGE. This is based on the clinical relevance of the expected task and the preliminary evidence regarding artificial intelligence in artificial or clinical settings.

The objective was to assess sex differences in response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and to explore possible risk factors associated with TNFi efficacy.\nA total of 969 patients with axial SpA (315 females, 654 males) enrolled in the BIOBADASER registry (2000-2019) who initiated a TNFi (first, second, or further lines) were studied. Statistical and artificial intelligence (AI)-based data analyses were used to explore the association of sex differences and other factors to TNFi response, using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), to calculate the BASDAI50, with an improvement of at least 50% of the BASDAI score, and using the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score, calculated using the C-reactive protein level (ASDAS-CRP).\nFemales had a lower probability of reaching a BASDAI50 response with a first line TNFi treatment at the second year of follow-up (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and a lesser reduction of the ASDAS-CRP at this time point. The logistic regression model showed lower BASDAI50 responses to TNFi in females (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Other factors, such as older age (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), were associated with unfavorable responses. The AI data analyses reinforced the idea that age at the beginning of the treatment was the main factor associated with an unfavorable response. The combination of age with other clinical characteristics (female sex or cardiovascular risk factors and events) potentially contributed to an unfavorable response to TNFi.\nIn this national multicenter registry, female sex was associated with less response to a first-line TNFi by the second year of follow-up. A higher age at the start of the TNFi was the main factor associated with an unfavorable response to TNFi.", "The development of both special education and gifted education as fields of study were closely tied to the origins of intelligence testing in the early 20th century. While special education's terminology has become more nuanced and circumspect over the ensuing century, the term gifted has remained unchanged despite coming under substantial criticism in recent decades for its lack of specificity and for the innateness that the term implies as the primary cause of individual differences in ability. We examine this history and the seminal nationally disseminated reports related to gifted education, from the Marland report to the present, to consider why the gifted label has persisted. We conclude with some suggestions for how these issues might be remedied.", "With the wide application of computational fluid dynamics in various fields and the continuous growth of the complexity of the problem and the scale of the computational grid, large-scale parallel computing came into being and became an indispensable means to solve this problem. In the numerical simulation of multi-block grids, the mapping strategy from grid block to processor is an important factor affecting the efficiency of load balancing and communication overhead. The multi-level graph partitioning algorithm is an important algorithm that introduces graph network dynamic programming to solve the load-balancing problem. This paper proposed a firefly-ant compound optimization (FaCO) algorithm for the weighted fusion of two optimization rules of the firefly and ant colony algorithm. For the graph, results after multi-level graph partitioning are transformed into a traveling salesman problem (TSP). This algorithm is used to optimize the load distribution of the solution, and finally, the rough graph segmentation is projected to obtain the most original segmentation optimization results. Although firefly algorithm (FA) and ant colony optimization (ACO), as swarm intelligence algorithms, are widely used to solve TSP problems, for the problems for which swarm intelligence algorithms easily fall into local optimization and low search accuracy, the improvement of the FaCO algorithm adjusts the weight of iterative location selection and updates the location. Experimental results on publicly available datasets such as the Oliver30 dataset and the eil51 dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of the FaCO algorithm. It is also significantly better than the commonly used firefly algorithm and other algorithms in terms of the search results and efficiency and achieves better results in optimizing the load-balancing problem of parallel computing.", "Data and autonomous systems are taking over our lives, from healthcare to smart homes very few aspects of our day to day are not permeated by them. The technological advances enabled by these technologies are limitless. However, with advantages so too come challenges. As these technologies encompass more and more aspects of our lives, we are forgetting the ethical, legal, safety and moral concerns that arise as an outcome of integrating our lives with technology. In this work, we study the lifecycle of artificial intelligence from data gathering to deployment, providing a structured analytical assessment of the potential ethical, safety and legal concerns. The paper then presents the foundations for the first ethical artificial intelligence sustainability statement to guide future development of AI in a safe and sustainable manner.", "Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is a surgical procedure, that is followed by cranioplasty surgery. DC is usually performed to treat patients with traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, brain edema, skull fractures, etc. In many published clinical case studies and systematic reviews, cranioplasty surgery is reported to restore cranial symmetry with good cosmetic outcomes and neurophysiologically relevant functional outcomes in hundreds of patients. In this review article, we present a number of key issues related to the manufacturing of patient-specific implants, clinical complications, cosmetic outcomes, and newer alternative therapies. While discussing alternative therapeutic treatments for cranioplasty, biomolecules and cellular-based approaches have been emphasized. The current clinical practices in the restoration of cranial defects involve 3D printing to produce patient-specific prefabricated cranial implants, that provide better cosmetic outcomes. Regardless of the advancements in image processing and 3D printing, the complete clinical procedure is time-consuming and requires significant costs. To reduce manual intervention and to address unmet clinical demands, it has been highlighted that automated implant fabrication by data-driven methods can accelerate the design and manufacturing of patient-specific cranial implants. The data-driven approaches, encompassing artificial intelligence (machine learning/deep learning) and E-platforms, such as publicly accessible clinical databases will lead to the development of the next generation of patient-specific cranial implants, which can provide predictable clinical outcomes. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Cranioplasty is performed to reconstruct cranial defects of patients who have undergone decompressive craniectomy. Cranioplasty surgery improves the aesthetic and functional outcomes of those patients. To meet the clinical demands of cranioplasty surgery, accelerated designing and manufacturing of 3D cranial implants are required. This review provides an overview of biomaterial implants and bone flap manufacturing methods for cranioplasty surgery. In addition, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine-based approaches to reduce clinical complications are also highlighted. The potential use of data-driven computer applications and data-driven artificial intelligence-based approaches are emphasized to accelerate the clinical protocols of cranioplasty treatment with less manual intervention and shorter intraoperative time.", "Heart ischemia is an irreversible condition that occurs via decreased blood flow in vessels by genetic factors, molecular regulators, and environmental conditions. The microRNAs binding to 3\u00b4UTR of target genes can influence gene expression and play pivotal roles in several mechanisms identified as a potential biomarker to the pathogenesis. We have screened a pool of microRNAs and mRNAs according to their potential correlation to myocardial ischemia based on artificial intelligence. We constructed the hub genes and mRNA-microRNA networks by R programing language and in silico analysis. Moreover, we calculated the binding affinity of the 3D structure of proanthocyanidin on VEGF\u03b1 and GATA4 to ameliorate heart tissue after ischemia. Then we treated rats with 300\u2009mg/kg proanthocyanidins and exercised in different intensity and duration times (low, moderate, and high-intensity interval training) for 14\u2009weeks. In the second step, after 14\u2009weeks, isoproterenol hydrochloride was injected into the rats, and myocardial ischemia was induced. We indicated that VEGF\u03b1, GATA4, and GJA1 axis associated with miR-27a-3p, miR-499-5p, miR-206-3p, miR-208a-3p are regulatable after 14\u2009weeks of exercise training and proanthocyanidin extract consumption and could prevent myocardial injuries in ischemia. Moreover, we revealed different intensity and duration times, and proanthocyanidin modulated the microRNA-mRNA interaction in rats with myocardial ischemia. Proanthocyanidin consumption as a bioactive compound may significantly ameliorate myocardial dysfunction and offset pathological hallmarks of myocardial ischemia. Moreover, exercise has protective effects on myocardial tissue by reprograming genes and genetic regulator factors. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Complimentary medicine identified Proanthocyanidin and exercise are recognized as effective methods to prevent and improve Myocardial ischemia. According to medical biology servers, we explored the VEGF\u03b1, GATA4, and GJA1 axis associated with miR-27a-3p, miR-499-5p, miR-206-3p, miR-208a-3p as a vital pathomechanism of myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, proanthocyanidin extract is the effective compound that could has protective effects on myocardial tissue by reprograming genes and genetic regulator factors. Furthermore, proanthocyanidin and swimming training might recover myocardial dysfunction and regulate the hub genes and mRNA-microRNA networks.", "We evaluated the contribution of artificial intelligence in predicting the risk of acute cellular rejection (ACR) using early plasma levels of soluble CD31 (sCD31) in combination with recipient haematosis, which was measured by the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional oxygen inspired (PaO2/FiO2) and respiratory SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) within 3\u00a0days of lung transplantation (LTx). CD31 is expressed on endothelial cells, leukocytes and platelets and acts as a \"peace-maker\" at the blood/vessel interface. Upon nonspecific activation, CD31 can be cleaved, released, and detected in the plasma (sCD31). The study included 40 lung transplant recipients, seven (17.5%) of whom experienced ACR. We modelled the plasma levels of sCD31 as a nonlinear dependent variable of the PaO2/FiO2 and respiratory SOFA over time using multivariate and multimodal models. A deep convolutional network classified the time series models of each individual associated with the risk of ACR to each individual in the cohort.", "To assess the status of hotspots and research trends on geographic information system (GIS)-based landslide susceptibility (LS), we analysed 1142 articles from the Thomas Reuters Web of Science Core Collection database published during 2001-2020 by combining bibliometric and content analysis. The paper number, authors, institutions, corporations, publication sources, citations, and keywords are noted as sub/categories for the bibliometric analysis. Thematic LS data, including the study site, landslide inventory, conditioning factors, mapping unit, susceptibility models, and mode fit/prediction performance evaluation, are presented in the content analysis. Then, we reveal the advantages and limitations of the common approaches used in thematic LS data and summarise the development trends. The results indicate that the distribution of articles shows clear clusters of authors, institutions, and countries with high academic activity. The application of remote sensing technology for interpreting landslides provides a more convenient and efficient landslide inventory. In the landslide inventory, most of the sample strategies representing the landslides are point and polygon, and the most frequently used sample subdividing strategy is random sampling. The scale effects, lack of geographic consistency, and no standard are key problems in landslide conditioning factors. Feature selection is used to choose the factors that can improve the model's accuracy. With advances in computing technology and artificial intelligence, LS models are changing from simple qualitative and statistical models to complex machine learning and hybrid models. Finally, five future research opportunities are revealed. This study will help investigators clarify the status of LS research and provide guidance for future research.", "The relationship of human brain structure to cognitive function is complex, and how this relationship differs between childhood and adulthood is poorly understood. One strong hypothesis suggests the cognitive function of Fluid Intelligence (Gf) is dependent on prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex. In this work, we developed a novel graph convolutional neural networks (gCNNs) for the analysis of localized anatomic shape and prediction of Gf. Morphologic information of the cortical ribbons and subcortical structures was extracted from T1-weighted MRIs within two independent cohorts, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD; age: 9.93\u2009\u00b1\u20090.62\u00a0years) of children and the Human Connectome Project (HCP; age: 28.81\u2009\u00b1\u20093.70\u00a0years). Prediction combining cortical and subcortical surfaces together yielded the highest accuracy of Gf for both ABCD (R\u2009=\u20090.314) and HCP datasets (R\u2009=\u20090.454), outperforming the state-of-the-art prediction of Gf from any other brain measures in the literature. Across both datasets, the morphology of the amygdala, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens, along with temporal, parietal and cingulate cortex consistently drove the prediction of Gf, suggesting a significant reframing of the relationship between brain morphology and Gf to include systems involved with reward/aversion processing, judgment and decision-making, motivation, and emotion.", "We evaluate the diagnostic performance of deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) for bladder cancer, which used white-light images (WLIs) and narrow-band images, and tumor grade prediction of AI based on tumor color using the red/green/blue (RGB) method. This retrospective study analyzed 10,991 cystoscopic images of suspicious bladder tumors using a mask region-based convolutional neural network with a ResNeXt-101-32\u2009\u00d7\u20098d-FPN backbone. The diagnostic performance of AI was evaluated by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy, and its ability to detect cancers was investigated using the dice score coefficient (DSC). Using the support vector machine model, we analyzed differences in tumor colors according to tumor grade using the RGB method. The sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and DSC of AI were 95.0%, 93.7%, 94.1% and 74.7%. In WLIs, there were differences in red and blue values according to tumor grade (p\u2009<\u20090.001). According to the average RGB value, the performance was\u2009\u2265\u200998% for the diagnosis of benign vs. low-and high-grade tumors using WLIs and\u2009>\u200990% for the diagnosis of chronic non-specific inflammation vs. carcinoma in situ using WLIs. The diagnostic performance of the AI-assisted diagnosis was of high quality, and the AI could distinguish the tumor grade based on tumor color.", "Little is known about the productive morphosyntax of Norwegian children with developmental language disorder (DLD). The current study examined morphosyntax in Norwegian-speaking children with DLD (n =19) and a control group that was pairwise matched for age, gender, and intelligence quotient (IQ; n = 19). The children's sentence repetitions were studied through the lens of Processability Theory. The group differences were largest for grammatical structures at the latest developmental stage of the processability hierarchy. The Norwegian subordinate clause word order, belonging to the latest stage of the processability hierarchy, stood out as particularly challenging for children with DLD. Only 2 children with DLD but 16 children in the control group produced a subordinate clause with subordinate clause word order. Categorization of children's errors revealed that children with DLD made more errors of all types (addition, omission, substitution, inflection and word order) but especially errors of omission and inflection.", "This study aimed to analyze the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) for orthodontic tooth extraction decision-making.\nPubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, LIVIVO, Computers & Applied Science, ACM Digital Library, Compendex, and gray literature (OpenGrey, ProQuest, and Google Scholar) were electronically searched. Three independent reviewers selected the studies and extracted and analyzed the data. Risk of bias, methodological quality, and certainty of evidence were assessed by QUADAS-2, checklist for AI research, and GRADE, respectively.\nThe search identified 1810 studies. After 2 phases of selection, six studies were included, showing an unclear risk of bias of patient selection. Two studies showed a high risk of bias in the index test, while two others presented an unclear risk of bias in the diagnostic test. Data were pooled in a random model and yielded an accuracy value of 0.87 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.75-0.96) for all studies, 0.89 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.70-1.00) for multilayer perceptron, and 0.88 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.73-0.98) for back propagation models. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of the multilayer perceptron model yielded 0.84 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.58-1.00), 0.89 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.74-0.98), and 0.92 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.72-1.00) scores, respectively. Sagittal discrepancy, upper crowding, and protrusion showed the highest ranks weighted in the models.\nOrthodontic tooth extraction decision-making using AI presented promising accuracy but should be considered with caution due to the very low certainty of evidence.\nAI models for tooth extraction decision in orthodontics cannot yet be considered a substitute for a final human decision.", "Microflora is actively used to produce value-added materials in industry, and each cell density should be controlled for stable microflora use. In this study, a simple system evaluating the cell density was constructed with artificial intelligence (AI) using the absorbance spectra data of microflora. To set up the system, the prediction system for cell density based on machine learning was constructed using the spectra data as the feature from the mixture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. As the results of predicting cell density by extremely randomized trees, when the cell densities of S. cerevisiae and C. reinhardtii were shifted and fixed, the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.8495; on the other hand, when the cell densities of S. cerevisiae and C. reinhardtii were fixed and shifted, the R2 was 0.9232. To explain the prediction system, the randomized trees regressor of the decision tree-based ensemble learning method as the machine learning algorithm and Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs) as the explainable AI (XAI) to interpret the features contributing to the prediction results were used. As a result of the SHAP analyses, not only the optical density, but also the absorbance of the Soret and Q bands derived from the chloroplasts of C. reinhardtii could contribute to the prediction as the features. The simple cell density evaluating system could have an industrial impact.", "A diagnosis with histological classification by pathologists is very important for appropriate treatments to improve the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. However, the number of pathologists is limited, and assisting the pathological diagnosis by artificial intelligence becomes very important. Here, we presented an automatic breast lesions detection model using microscopic histopathological images based on a Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) for the first time and evaluated its significance in assisting the diagnosis.\nWe built the data set and trained the SSD model with 1361 microscopic images and evaluated using 315 images. Pathologists and medical students diagnosed the images with or without the assistance of the model to investigate the significance of our model in assisting the diagnosis.\nThe model achieved 88.3% and 90.5% diagnostic accuracies in 3-class (benign, non-invasive carcinoma, or invasive carcinoma) or 2-class (benign or malignant) classification tasks, respectively, and the mean intersection over union was 0.59. Medical students achieved a remarkably higher diagnostic accuracy score (average 84.7%) with the assistance of the model compared to those without assistance (average 67.4%). Some people diagnosed images in a short time using the assistance of the model (shorten by average 6.4\u202fmin) while others required a longer time (extended by 7.2\u202fmin).\nWe presented the automatic breast lesions detection method at high speed using histopathological micrographs. The present system may conveniently support the histological diagnosis by pathologists in laboratories.", "Following a proof-of-concept presentation on dual-use artificial intelligence (AI) in drug discovery by Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the Swiss Federal Institute for NBC-Protection, we explored how a generative algorithm could develop the nerve agent VX and tens of thousands of analogs in a highly impactful Nature Machine Intelligence commentary. We not only laid out the experiment, but, with guidance from experts on arms control and dual-use, we called for more discussion around the general repurposing potential of AI in drug discovery. To continue that conversation, we now share further details on the experiment and place our experiences in the larger frame of other scientists who have similarly developed powerful technologies but without engaging with, or even truly understanding, the misuse potential and downstream consequences of the technologies. It is our sincere hope that our experiment may serve as an important wake-up call for users of generative AI.", "Artificial intelligence has been developing greatly in the field of medicine. As a new research hotspot of artificial intelligence, deep learning (DL) has been widely applied in the fields of cancer risk assessment, symptom recognition, and cancer detection. Therefore, nursing care issues in terms of consuming time and energy, lower accuracy, and lower efficiency can be solved with applying DL in caring cancer patients. In addition, augmented reality (AR) has great navigation potential through combining computer-generated virtual elements with the real world. Thus, DL\u00a0\u200b+\u00a0\u200bAR may facilitate patients with cancer to possess a brand-new model of nursing care that is more intelligent, mobile, and adapted to the information age, compared to traditional nursing. With the advent of the era of intelligent nursing, future nursing models can not only learn from the DL\u00a0\u200b+\u00a0\u200bAR model to meet the needs of patients with cancer but also reduce nursing workload, save healthcare resources, and improve work efficiency, the quality of nursing care, as well as the quality of life for cancer patients.", "The intelligent construction of coal mining enterprises is the fundamental strategy to prevent and curb major coal mine accidents, and the core technical support to realize the high-quality development of the coal industry. Considering the intelligent construction of coal mining enterprises enabled by emerging information technologies such as 5G and artificial intelligence, this paper constructs a Moran process stochastic evolutionary game model of intelligent construction of coal mining enterprises. Based on the fixed point probability of the Moran process, the probability of successful invasion of the \"intelligent construction\" strategy and the \"traditional production\" strategy in the limited coal mining enterprise group is calculated. By comparing the probability of individual fixed point and the probability of neutral mutation, the dominant condition of the strategy under strong selection and weak selection is obtained. The research shows that external stochastic factors, the number and scale of enterprises, the intensity of capacity replacement and the cost-benefit of intelligent construction are the main factors affecting the intelligent construction behavior of coal mining enterprises. When the intelligent construction of coal mining enterprises is in the cultivation period, the intelligent construction of underground coal mines dominated by stochastic factors can be effectively promoted by increasing the intensity of capacity reduction replacement. For the open-pit coal mine dominated by expected payoffs, reducing the number of mining rights and improving the concentration of open-pit coal mining industry will have a better effect on promoting its intelligent cultivation process. When the intelligent construction of coal mining enterprises is in the mature stage, with the improvement of the cost and benefits of intelligent construction, \"intelligent construction\" strategy will become a general consensus of coal mining enterprises. In addition, this paper analyzes the relevant parameters through specific examples to verify the effectiveness of the conclusions, which provides a scientific basis for effectively accelerating the intelligent construction of coal mining enterprises and promoting the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry.", "Computer tomography is an extensively used method for the detection of the disease in the subjects. Basically, computer-aided tomography depending on the artificial intelligence reveals its significance in smart health care monitoring system. Owing to its security and the private issue, analyzing the computed tomography dataset has become a tedious process. This study puts forward the convolutional autoencrypted deep learning neural network to assist unsupervised learning technique. By carrying out various experiments, our proposed method produces better results comparative to other traditional methods, which efficaciously solves the issues related to the artificial image description. Hence, the convolutional autoencoder is widely used in measuring the lumps in the bronchi. With the unsupervised machine learning, the extracted features are used for various applications.", "Clinical abundance of artificial intelligence has increased significantly in the last decade. This survey aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge and acceptance of AI applications among surgeons in Germany.\nA total of 357 surgeons from German university hospitals, academic teaching hospitals and private practices were contacted by e-mail and asked to participate in the anonymous survey.\nA total of 147 physicians completed the survey. The majority of respondents (n = 85, 52.8%) stated that they were familiar with AI applications in medicine. Personal knowledge was self-rated as average (n = 67, 41.6%) or rudimentary (n = 60, 37.3%) by the majority of participants. On the basis of various application scenarios, it became apparent that the respondents have different demands on AI applications in the area of \"diagnosis confirmation\" as compared to the area of \"therapy decision.\" For the latter category, the requirements in terms of the error level are significantly higher and more respondents view their application in medical practice rather critically. Accordingly, most of the participants hope that AI systems will primarily improve diagnosis confirmation, while they see their ethical and legal problems with regard to liability as the main obstacle to extensive clinical application.\nGerman surgeons are in principle positively disposed toward AI applications. However, many surgeons see a deficit in their own knowledge and in the implementation of AI applications in their own professional environment. Accordingly, medical education programs targeting both medical students and healthcare professionals should convey basic knowledge about the development and clinical implementation process of AI applications in different medical fields, including surgery.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) offers considerable promise for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening and diagnosis. The development of deep-learning algorithms to detect the presence of disease may contribute to sufficient screening, early detection, and timely treatment for this preventable blinding disease. This review aimed to systematically examine the literature in AI algorithms in detecting ROP. Specifically, we focused on the performance of deep-learning algorithms through sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for both the detection and grade of ROP.\nWe searched Medline OVID, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for studies published from January 1, 2012, to September 20, 2021. Studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of deep-learning models based on retinal fundus images with expert ophthalmologists' judgment as reference standard were included. Studies which did not investigate the presence or absence of disease were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool.\nTwelve studies out of the 175 studies identified were included. Five studies measured the performance of detecting the presence of ROP and seven studies determined the presence of plus disease. The average AUROC out of 11 studies was 0.98. The average sensitivity and specificity for detecting ROP was 95.72% and 98.15%, respectively, and for detecting plus disease was 91.13% and 95.92%, respectively.\nThe diagnostic performance of deep-learning algorithms in published studies was high. Few studies presented externally validated results or compared performance to expert human graders. Large scale prospective validation alongside robust study design could improve future studies.", "Identifying organs within histology images is a fundamental and non-trivial step in toxicological digital pathology workflows as multiple organs often appear on the same whole slide image (WSI). Previous works in automated tissue classification have investigated the use of single magnifications, and demonstrated limitations when attempting to identify small and contiguous organs at low magnifications. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we present a multi-magnification convolutional neural network (CNN), called MMO-Net, which employs context and cellular detail from different magnifications to facilitate the recognition of complex organs. Across N=320 WSI from 3 contract research organization (CRO) laboratories, we demonstrate state-of-the-art organ detection and segmentation performance of 7 rat organs with and without lesions: liver, kidney, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, urinary bladder, salivary gland, and mandibular lymph node (AUROC=0.99-1.0 for all organs, Dice\u22650.9 except parathyroid (0.73)). Evaluation takes place at both inter- and intra CRO levels, suggesting strong generalizability performance. Results are qualitatively reviewed using visualization masks to ensure separation of organs in close proximity (e.g., thyroid vs parathyroid glands). MMO-Net thus offers organ localization that serves as a potential quality control tool to validate WSI metadata and as a preprocessing step for subsequent organ-specific artificial intelligence (AI) use cases. To facilitate research in this area, all associated WSI and metadata used for this study are being made freely available, forming a first of its kind dataset for public use.", "Powerful detectors at modern experimental facilities routinely collect data at multiple GB/s. Online analysis methods are needed to enable the collection of only interesting subsets of such massive data streams, such as by explicitly discarding some data elements or by directing instruments to relevant areas of experimental space. Thus, methods are required for configuring and running distributed computing pipelines-what we call flows-that link instruments, computers (e.g., for analysis, simulation, artificial intelligence [AI] model training), edge computing (e.g., for analysis), data stores, metadata catalogs, and high-speed networks. We review common patterns associated with such flows and describe methods for instantiating these patterns. We present experiences with the application of these methods to the processing of data from five different scientific instruments, each of which engages powerful computers for data inversion,model training, or other purposes. We also discuss implications of such methods for operators and users of scientific facilities.", "Artificial intelligence is taking the world by storm and soon will be aiding patients in their journey at the hospital. The trials and tribulations of the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic have set the stage for shifting healthcare from a physical to a cyber-physical space. A physician can now remotely monitor a patient, admitting them only if they meet certain thresholds, thereby reducing the total number of admissions at the hospital. Coordination, communication, and resource management have been core issues for any industry. However, it is most accurate in healthcare. Both systems and providers are exhausted under the burden of increasing data and complexity of care delivery, increasing costs, and financial burden. Simultaneously, there is a digital transformation of healthcare in the making. This transformation provides an opportunity to create systems of care that are artificial intelligence-enabled. Healthcare resources can be utilized more justly. The wastage of financial and intellectual resources in an overcrowded healthcare system can be avoided by implementing IoT, telehealth, and AI/ML-based algorithms. It is imperative to consider the design principles of the patient's journey while simultaneously prioritizing a better user experience to alleviate physician concerns. This paper discusses the entire blueprint of the AI/ML-assisted patient journey and its impact on healthcare provision.", "Protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction is essential to understand the functions of proteins in various biological processes and their roles in the development, progression, and treatment of different diseases. To perform economical large-scale PPI analysis, several artificial intelligence-based approaches have been proposed. However, these approaches have limited predictive performance due to the use of in-effective statistical representation learning methods and predictors that lack the ability to extract comprehensive discriminative features. The paper in hand generates statistical representation of protein sequences by applying transfer learning in an unsupervised manner using FastText embedding generation approach. Furthermore, it presents \"ADH-PPI\" classifier which reaps the benefits of three different neural layers, long short-term memory, convolutional, and self-attention layers. Over two different species benchmark datasets, proposed ADH-PPI predictor outperforms existing approaches by an overall accuracy of 4%, and matthews correlation coefficient of 6%. In addition, it achieves an overall accuracy increment of 7% on four independent test sets. Availability: ADH-PPI web server is publicly available at https://sds_genetic_analysis.opendfki.de/PPI/.", "Due to technical advancements and the proliferation of mobile applications, facial analysis (FA) of humans has recently become an important area for computer vision research. FA investigates a variety of difficulties, including gender recognition, facial expression recognition, age and race recognition, with the goal of automatically comprehending social interactions. Due to the dimensional challenge posed by pre-trained CNN networks, the scientific community has developed numerous techniques inspired by biology, swarm intelligence theory, physics, and mathematical rules. This article presents a gender recognition system based on scAOA, that is a modified version of the Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA). The latest variant (scAOA) enhances the exploitation stage by using trigonometric operators inspired by the sine cosine algorithm (SCA) in order to prevent local optima and to accelerate the convergence. The main purpose of this paper is to apply scAOA to select the relevant deep features provided by two pretrained models of CNN (AlexNet & ResNet) to recognize the gender of a human person categorized into two classes (men and women). Two datasets are used to evaluate the proposed approach (scAOA): the Brazilian FEI dataset and the Georgia Tech Face dataset (GT). In terms of accuracy, Fscore and statistical test, the comparison analysis demonstrates that scAOA outperforms other modern and competitive optimizers such as AOA, SCA, Ant lion optimizer (ALO), Salp swarm algorithm (SSA), Grey wolf optimizer (GWO), Simple genetic algorithm (SGA), Grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) and Particle swarm optimizer (PSO).", "The paper describes the setting up and long-term continuous operation of the first real-life, pilot scale, sewage treatment plant based on the recently patented phytoremediation technology, trademarked as SHEFROL\u00ae. The unit was about three times cheaper to install, operate and maintain than the least expensive of the other wetland-based technologies presently in vogue. Its semi-permanent version is 30 times cheaper. Monitoring of flow rates and levels of treatment intermittently over a 3\u2009year course of continuous operation indicated the constancy and robustness of the reactor in treating total solids, suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and soluble phosphorous to the average extents of 94, 84, 79, 70, 62 and 28% respectively. Earlier experience with bench-scale SHEFROL\u00ae units has indicated that removal of metals like Cu, Ni, Co, Zn, and Mn also takes place to the extent of 25-45% in these systems. These primary, secondary, and tertiary treatments occurred in a single unit process with no necessity of any pumping, aeration, or recycling. Models based on artificial intelligence were developed which enable forecasting the reactor performance in terms of secondary and tertiary treatment, respectively.\nThe paper describes the setting-up, long-term (3\u2009years) performance evaluation at pilot scale, and modeling of a recently patented novel and unprecedented phytoremediation-based sewage treatment technology. The system is seen to be much more robust, versatile, space efficient, and economical, than existing macrophyte-based sewage treatment systems.", "In recent years, digital pathology has been rapidly developing and applied throughout the world. Especially in clinical settings, it has been utilized in a variety of situations, including automated cancer diagnosis. Conversely, in non-clinical research, it has not yet been utilized as much as in clinical settings. We have been performing automated recognition of various pathological animal tissues and quantitative analysis of pathological findings, including liver and lung. In this study, we attempted to construct an artificial intelligence (AI)-based trained model that can automatedly recognize glomerular lesions in mouse kidneys that are characterized by complex structures.\nBy using hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images (WSI) from Col4a3 KO mice as variation data, normal glomeruli and glomerular lesions were annotated, and deep learning (DL) was performed with the use of the neural network classifier DenseNet system in HALO AI. The trained model was refined by correcting the annotation of misrecognized tissue area and reperforming DL. The accuracy of the trained model was confirmed by comparing the AI-obtained results with the pathological grades evaluated by pathologists. The generality of the trained model was also confirmed by analyzing the WSI of adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephropathy mice, which is a different disease model.\nGlomerular lesions (including mesangial proliferation, crescent formation, and sclerosis) observed in Col4a3 KO mice and ADR mice were detected by our trained model. The number of glomerular lesions detected by our trained model were also highly correlated with that of counted by pathologists.\nIn this study, we constructed a trained model allowing us to automatedly recognize glomerular lesions in the mouse kidney with the use of the HALO AI system. The findings and insights of this study will facilitate the development of digital pathology in non-clinical research and improve the probability of success in drug discovery research.", "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the field of clothes can provide a good development mode and system under the social context of AI technology development. AI provides help for the development of intelligent clothing. Intelligent clothing is a high-tech product that integrates intelligent technology and clothing. It combines cutting-edge technologies in electronic information technology, sensor technology, textile science, and material science. In the extraction and analysis of environmental factors in clothing handicraft, AI technology has a considerable application prospect and a certain development potential. In order to improve the accuracy of environmental factors extraction in clothing handicraft, this paper uses convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract and analyze environmental factors in traditional clothing handicraft. We carried out experiments on the extraction of environmental factors in clothing handicrafts with pure color, few patterns, patterns, and complex background. The experimental results show that the CNN has a good effect on the extraction of environmental factors in clothing handicraft under different backgrounds. In addition, the model in this paper has good stability, accuracy, and feature extraction speed, which has high practical value and research significance.", "Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are being widely used to manage COVID-19 pandemic. However, many results remain unreported or unconfirmed, altering a correct epidemiological surveillance.\nOur aim was to evaluate an artificial intelligence-based smartphone app, connected to a cloud web platform, to automatically and objectively read RDT results and assess its impact on COVID-19 pandemic management.\nOverall, 252 human sera were used to inoculate a total of 1165 RDTs for training and validation purposes. We then conducted two field studies to assess the performance on real-world scenarios by testing 172 antibody RDTs at two nursing homes and 96 antigen RDTs at one hospital emergency department.\nField studies demonstrated high levels of sensitivity (100%) and specificity (94.4%, CI 92.8%-96.1%) for reading IgG band of COVID-19 antibody RDTs compared to visual readings from health workers. Sensitivity of detecting IgM test bands was 100%, and specificity was 95.8% (CI 94.3%-97.3%). All COVID-19 antigen RDTs were correctly read by the app.\nThe proposed reading system is automatic, reducing variability and uncertainty associated with RDTs interpretation and can be used to read different RDT brands. The web platform serves as a real-time epidemiological tracking tool and facilitates reporting of positive RDTs to relevant health authorities.", "Artificial intelligence and machine learning have demonstrated remarkable results in science and applied work. However, present AI models, developed to be run on computers but used in human-driven applications, create a visible disconnect between AI forms of processing and human ways of discovering and using knowledge. In this work, we introduce a new concept of \"Human Knowledge Models\" (HKMs), designed to reproduce human computational abilities. Departing from a vast body of cognitive research, we formalized the definition of HKMs into a new form of machine learning. Then, by training the models with human processing capabilities, we learned human-like knowledge, that humans can not only understand, but also compute, modify, and apply. We used several datasets from different applied fields to demonstrate the advantages of HKMs, including their high predictive power and resistance to noise and overfitting. Our results proved that HKMs can efficiently mine knowledge directly from the data and can compete with complex AI models in explaining the main data patterns. As a result, our study reveals the great potential of HKMs, particularly in the decision-making applications where \"black box\" models cannot be accepted. Moreover, this improves our understanding of how well human decision-making, modeled by HKMs, can approach the ideal solutions in real-life problems.", "Although a range of studies has explored the effects of the content and language integrated learning (CLIL) approach on students' achievement, its impact on improving university students' transversal skills (TSs) has remained largely unexplored in Iran. Thus, the present study has a two-fold purpose. First, it aims to investigate the role of the CLIL approach in improving Iranian university students' TSs. Second, it purports to explore the mediating role of emotional intelligence (EI) in the relationship between the CLIL approach and TSs. For this purpose, a survey design was used wherein a research-made questionnaire was distributed among 123 university students to gather the required data. Findings disclosed that the CLIL approach had a positive role in developing the university students' TSs. Further, the results indicated that EI positively affected the development of TSs in university students. Moreover, the findings evidenced that EI significantly mediated the relationship between the CLIL approach and the development of the university students' TSs. The study concludes that applying the CLIL approach involves an entirely new paradigm, offering valuable implications for relevant stakeholders.", "We aimed to determine how cognitive impairment relates to the extent of the presumed epileptogenic zone in pediatric focal epilepsies. We analyzed the cognitive functions in unilobar compared to multilobar focal epilepsy patients that underwent neuropsychological testing at a tertiary epilepsy center.\nWe assessed cognitive functions of pediatric focal epilepsy patients with the German version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales that measures full-scale IQ and subcategories. We assessed differences in IQ and epilepsy-related variables between unilobar and multilobar epilepsy patients.\nWe included 62 patients (37 unilobar, 25 multilobar), aged 10.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7 years. Full-scale IQ values were significantly higher in unilobar (93.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.7, 95% CI 87.7-99.6) than in multilobar epilepsy patients (77.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.2, 95% CI 69.3-85.0; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In all but one IQ subcategory (working memory), significantly higher values were measured in unilobar than in multilobar epilepsy patients. The proportion of unilobar epilepsy patients with severe cognitive impairment (8.3%) and below-average intelligence (30.5%) was lower compared to multilobar epilepsy patients (47.6% and 61.9%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.021, respectively). Epilepsy onset occurred earlier in multilobar (4.0 years, 95% CI 2.6-5.5, SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4 years) than in unilobar epilepsy patients (7.0 years, 95% CI 5.5-8.5, SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4 years, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008).\nPediatric multilobar epilepsy patients face more cognitive issues than unilobar epilepsy patients on average. Our findings should help to identify children and adolescents who are most at risk for impaired cognitive development. A limitation of our study is the simple division into unilobar and multilobar epilepsies, with no specific account being taken of etiology/epilepsy syndrome, which can have a profound effect on cognition.", "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) remains the leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. Recent advances in ROP imaging have significantly improved our understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiological course of ROP including the acute phase, regression, reactivation, and late complications, known as adult ROP. Recent progress includes various contact and noncontact wide-field imaging devices for fundus imaging, smartphone-based fundus photography, wide-field fluorescein angiography, handheld optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices for wide-field en face OCT images, and OCT angiography. Images taken by those devices were incorporated in the recently updated guidelines of ROP, the International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity, Third Edition (ICROP3). ROP imaging has also allowed the real-world adoption of telemedicine- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening. Recent study demonstrated proof of concept that AI has a high diagnostic performance for the detection of ROP in a real-world screening. Here, we summarize the recent advances in ROP imaging and their application for screening, diagnosis, and management of ROP.", "Oral health is grounded in the United National (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Developement and its 17 Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages). The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Strategy on Oral Health calls for prioritizing environmentally sustainable and less invasive oral health care, and planetary health. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to power the next generation of oral health services and care, however its relationship with the broader UN and WHO concepts of sustainability remains poorly defined and articulated. We review the double-edged relationships between AI and oral health, to suggest actions that promote a sustainable deployment of AI for oral health.\nConcepts regarding AI, sustainability and sustainable development were identified and defined. A review of several double-edged relationship between AI and SDGs were exposed for the field of Oral Health.\nMedline and international declarations of the WHO, the UN and the World Dental Federation (FDI) were screened.\nOne the one hand, AI may reduce transportation, optimize care delivery (SDG 3 \"Good Health and Well-Being\", SDG 13 \"Climate Action\"), and increase accessibility of services and reduce inequality (SDG 10 \"Reduced Inequalities\", SDG 4 \"Quality Education\"). On the other hand, the deployment, implementation and maintenance of AI require significant resources (SDG 12 \"Responsible Consumption and Production\"), and costs for AI may aggravate inequalities. Also, AI may be biased, reinforcing inequalities (SDG 10) and discrimination (SDG 5), and may violate principles of security, privacy and confidentiality of personal information (SDG 16).\nSystematic assessment of the positive impact and adverse effects of AI on sustainable oral health may help to foster the former and curb the latter based on evidence.\nIf sustainability imperatives are actively taken into consideration, the community of oral health professionals should then employ AI for improving effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of oral healthcare; strengthen oral health surveillance; foster education and accessibility of care; ensure fairness, transparency and governance of AI for oral health; develop legislation and infrastructure to expand the use of digital health technologies including AI.", "Many cancer patients die due to their treatment failing because of their disease's resistance to chemotherapy and other forms of radiation therapy. Resistance may develop at any stage of therapy, even at the beginning. Several factors influence current therapy, including the type of cancer and the existence of genetic abnormalities. The response to treatment is not always predicted by the existence of a genetic mutation and might vary for various cancer subtypes. It is clear that cancer patients must be assigned a particular treatment or combination of drugs based on prediction models. Preliminary studies utilizing artificial intelligence-based prediction models have shown promising results. Building therapeutically useful models is still difficult despite enormous increases in computer capacity due to the lack of adequate clinically important pharmacogenomics data. Machine learning is the most widely used branch of artificial intelligence. Here, we review the current state in the area of using machine learning to predict treatment response. In addition, examples of machine learning algorithms being employed in clinical practice are offered.", "Technical advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in cardiac imaging are rapidly improving the reproducibility of this approach and the possibility to reduce time necessary to generate a report. In cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) the main application of AI in clinical practice is focused on detection of stenosis, characterization of coronary plaques, and detection of myocardial ischemia. In cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) the application of AI is focused on post-processing and particularly on the segmentation of cardiac chambers during late gadolinium enhancement. In echocardiography, the application of AI is focused on segmentation of cardiac chambers and is helpful for valvular function and wall motion abnormalities. The common thread represented by all of these techniques aims to shorten the time of interpretation without loss of information compared to the standard approach. In this review we provide an overview of AI applications in multimodality cardiac imaging.", "COVID-19 pandemic is tremendously impacted by socioeconomic and health determinants worldwide. This study aimed to determine factors associated with COVID-19 fatality among member states and partner countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\nAn ecological study was conducted using COVID-19 data of 48 countries for the period between 31 December 2019-31 December 2021. The outcome variables were COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) and years of life lost to COVID-19 (YLLs). Countries' sociodemographics and COVID-19-related data were extracted from OECD website, Our World in Data, John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) and WHO.\nIn the first year of the pandemic (December 2019-January 2021), highest CFR was observed in Mexico, 8.51%, followed by China, 5.17% and Bulgaria, 4.12%), and highest YLLs was observed in Mexico, 2,055 per 100,000. At regional level, highest CFR was observed in North & central America, 4.25 (3.71) %, followed by South America (2.5 (0.1) %); whereas highest YLLs was observed in South America region 1457.5 (274.8) per 100,000, followed by North & central America, 1207.3 (908.1) per 100,000. As of 31 December 2021, Mexico (7.52%) and Bulgaria (4.78%) had highest CFR; on the other hand, highest YLLs was observed in England, 26.5 per 1,000, followed by the United States, 25.9 per 1,000. At regional level, highest CFR (3.37(3.19) %) and YLLs (16.7 (13) per 1,000) were both observed in North & central America. Globally, the analysis of the 2-year cumulative data showed inverse correlation between CFR and nurse per 10,000 (R = -0.48; p < 0.05) and GDP per capita (R = -0.54; p < 0.001), whereas positive correlation was observed between YLLs and elderly population rate (R = 0.66; p < 0.05) and overweight/obese population rates (R = 0.55; p < 0.05).\nThis study provides insights on COVID-19 burden among OECD states and partner countries. GDP per capita, overweight/obesity and the rate of elderly population emerged as major social and health determinants of COVID-19 related burden and fatality. Findings suggest that a robust economy and interventions designed to promote healthy longevity and prevent weight gain in at-risk individuals might reduce COVID-19 burden and fatality among OECD states and partner countries.", "The development and deployment of machine learning systems can be executed easily with modern tools, but the process is typically rushed and means-to-an-end. Lack of diligence can lead to technical debt, scope creep and misaligned objectives, model misuse and failures, and expensive consequences. Engineering systems, on the other hand, follow well-defined processes and testing standards to streamline development for high-quality, reliable results. The extreme is spacecraft systems, with mission critical measures and robustness throughout the process. Drawing on experience in both spacecraft engineering and machine learning (research through product across domain areas), we've developed a proven systems engineering approach for machine learning and artificial intelligence: the Machine Learning Technology Readiness Levels framework defines a principled process to ensure robust, reliable, and responsible systems while being streamlined for machine learning workflows, including key distinctions from traditional software engineering, and a lingua franca for people across teams and organizations to work collaboratively on machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. Here we describe the framework and elucidate with use-cases from physics research to computer vision apps to medical diagnostics.", "The facial recognition system is an application tool that uses artificial intelligence technology and biometrics technology to analyze and recognize the facial feature information of the human face. It is widely used in various fields, such as attendance and access control management in schools and companies, identity monitoring in stations and stores, facial recognition for fugitive criminals, and facial payment on mobile terminals. However, due to the short development time of the facial recognition system, the facial recognition system has the problem of low recognition accuracy when the recognized object is not cooperative. Although some scholars have proposed the region of interest (ROI)-K nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) convolutional neural network theory by using the ROI and KNN and applied it to face recognition, the facial recognition system based on ROI-KNN convolutional neural network did not solve the problems of insufficient facial recognition accuracy and insufficient security. Under the conditions of insufficient illumination, excessive expression change, occlusion, high similarity of different individuals, and dynamic recognition, the recognition effect of the facial recognition system based on the ROI-KNN convolutional neural network is relatively limited. Therefore, to make the recognition accuracy of the facial recognition system higher and to make the facial recognition system play a greater role in the social and economic fields, this paper used the adaptive quantum genetic algorithm, the improved marker line graph genetic algorithm, and the feature weight value genetic algorithm to study the facial recognition system of the ROI-KNN convolutional neural network. The research results showed that after improving the ROI-KNN convolutional neural network based on the genetic algorithm, the recognition accuracy of the facial recognition system was increased by 4.99%, the recognition speed was increased by 7.46%, and the recognition security was increased by 2.66%.", "Whether the multi-dimensional data of serially measured blood pressure contains information for predicting the future risk of death in elderly individuals in nursing homes is unclear.\nOf the elderly individuals staying in a nursing home, 19,740 and 40,055 individuals with serially measured blood pressure from day 1 to 365 (for AI-long) and 1 to 90 (for AI-short) along with the death information at day 366 to 730 and 91-365 were included. The neural network-based artificial intelligence (AI) was applied to find the relationship between BP time-series and the future risks of death in both populations.\nAI-long found a significant relationship between the serially measured BP from day 1 to day 365 days and the risk of death occurring 366-730 days with c-statistics of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.51-0.63). AI-short also found a significant relationship between the serially measured BP from day 1 to day 90 and the rate of death occurring 91-365 days with c-statistics of 0.58 (95%CI: 0.52-0.63).\nOur results suggest that neural network-based AI could find the hidden subtle relationship between multi-dimensional data of serially measured BP and the future risk of death in apparently healthy elderly Japanese individuals under nursing care.", "Clinical coding is the task of transforming medical information in a patient's health records into structured codes so that they can be used for statistical analysis. This is a cognitive and time-consuming task that follows a standard process in order to achieve a high level of consistency. Clinical coding could potentially be supported by an automated system to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the process. We introduce the idea of automated clinical coding and summarise its challenges from the perspective of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), based on the literature, our project experience over the past two and half years (late 2019-early 2022), and discussions with clinical coding experts in Scotland and the UK. Our research reveals the gaps between the current deep learning-based approach applied to clinical coding and the need for explainability and consistency in real-world practice. Knowledge-based methods that represent and reason the standard, explainable process of a task may need to be incorporated into deep learning-based methods for clinical coding. Automated clinical coding is a promising task for AI, despite the technical and organisational challenges. Coders are needed to be involved in the development process. There is much to achieve to develop and deploy an AI-based automated system to support coding in the next five years and beyond.", "Stethoscope-recorded chest sounds provide the opportunity for remote cardio-respiratory health monitoring of neonates. However, reliable monitoring requires high-quality heart and lung sounds. This paper presents novel artificial intelligence-based Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) and Non-negative Matrix Co-Factorisation (NMCF) methods for neonatal chest sound separation. To assess these methods and compare them with existing single-channel separation methods, an artificial mixture dataset was generated comprising heart, lung, and noise sounds. Signal-to-noise ratios were then calculated for these artificial mixtures. These methods were also tested on real-world noisy neonatal chest sounds and assessed based on vital sign estimation error, and a signal quality score of 1-5, developed in our previous works. Overall, both the proposed NMF and NMCF methods outperform the next best existing method by 2.7 dB to 11.6 dB for the artificial dataset, and 0.40 to 1.12 signal quality improvement for the real-world dataset. The median processing time for the sound separation of a 10 s recording was found to be 28.3 s for NMCF and 342 ms for NMF. With the stable and robust performance of our proposed methods, we believe these methods are useful to denoise neonatal heart and lung sounds in the real-world environment.", "Mastery motivation is a multifaceted, psychological force that stimulates a child to master skills or tasks and is positively associated with language-related competences. Children with developmental delay might have lower levels of motivation, and their parents might face escalated parenting stress as well. The aims of this study were to identify the characteristics of mastery motivation in toddlers with language delay by intergroup and intragroup comparison, and to investigate the associations between specific components of parenting stress and toddler's mastery motivation. Eighty Chinese-speaking Taiwanese toddlers aged 19 to 42\u00a0months and their parents (fifty toddlers with language delay and thirty toddlers with typical development) participated in the study. The language delay group was selected based on maternal reports of vocabulary production with the Mandarin-Chinese Communicative Development Inventory and direct assessment with an individualized developmental test or intelligence test. The Revised Dimensions of Mastery Questionnaire (DMQ 18) with Preschool version, and the Parenting Stress Index Short Form were used to measure three domains of child mastery motivation and parents' components of parenting stress, respectively. Toddlers with language delay were rated as having lower gross motor and social mastery motivation than their peers with typical development; however, they showed the strength/weakness intragroup characteristics of higher gross motor motivation and lower social motivation with other children. Parental stress in the language delay group was significantly negatively correlated with mastery motivation, and the component of Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction was negatively associated with toddlers' Total Mastery Motivation, social motivation, and two indicators of expressive aspect after controlling for toddlers' age, cognitive ability, and family social-economic status. In conclusion, it is necessary for early interventionists to observe parenting stress and mastery motivation during the process of early intervention.", "The blossoming Chinese medical device market calls for a science-based regulatory system in China. Consistent efforts have been made to advance the medical device regulatory reforms for innovation, translation and industry development. In this article, we report both the latest regulatory requirements which aim to ensure safety and efficacy for patients while encouraging innovation of the medical device industry, and the key programs on medical devices covered in the Regulatory Science Action Plan (RSAP) of the National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA). The main features of the revised regulations are first elucidated before the opportunities for translational research are interpreted, including those for additive manufacturing and customized devices, drug-device combination products, artificial intelligence-powered software and surgical robots, and nanomaterials for medical devices.

In many cases, spectral information is distorted by elements such as instruments' broad optical transfer function, and electronic high frequency noises. In the past decades, advances in artificial intelligence methods have provided robust tools to better study sophisticated system artifacts in spectral data and take steps towards removing these artifacts from the experimentally obtained data. This study evaluates the capability of a recently developed deep convolutional neural network script, EELSpecNet, in restoring the reality of a spectral data. The particular strength of the deep neural networks is to remove multiple instrumental artifacts such as random energy jitters of the source, signal convolution by the optical transfer function and high frequency noise at once using a single training data set. Here, EELSpecNet performance in reducing noise, and restoring the original reality of the spectra is evaluated for near zero-loss electron energy loss spectroscopy signals in Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy. EELSpecNet demonstrates to be more efficient and more robust than the currently widely used Bayesian statistical method, even in harsh conditions (e.g. high signal broadening, intense high frequency noise).", "There are many types of neurological diseases with complex etiologies. At present, most clinical drugs can only relieve symptoms but cannot cure these diseases. Radix Polygalae, a famous traditional Chinese medicine from the root of plants of the genus Polygala, has the traditional effect of treating insomnia, forgetfulness, and palpitation and improving intelligence and other symptoms of neurological diseases. Saponins are important bioactive components of plants of the genus Polygala and exhibit neuroprotective effects.\nThis review aimed to summarize the traditional use of Polygala species and discuss the latest phytochemical, pharmacological, and toxicological findings, mainly with regard to Polygala saponins in the treatment of neurological disorders.\nLiterature was searched and collected using databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, CNKI, and Google Scholar. The search terms used included \"Polygala\", \"saponins\", \"neurological diseases\", \"Alzheimer's disease\", \"toxicity\", etc., and combinations of these keywords. A total of 1202 papers were retrieved until August 2022, and we included 135 of these papers on traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and other fields.\nThis literature review mainly reports on the traditional use of the Polygala genus and prescriptions containing Radix Polygalae in neurological diseases. Phytochemical studies have shown that plants of the genus Polygala mainly include saponins, flavonoids, oligosaccharide esters, alkaloids, coumarins, lignans, flavonoids, etc. Among them, saponins are the majority. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that Polygala saponins have neuroprotective effects on a variety of neurological diseases. Its mechanism of action involves autophagic degradation of misfolded proteins, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, antioxidative stress and so on. Toxicological studies have shown that Polygala saponins trigger gastrointestinal toxicity, and honey processing and glycosyl disruption of Polygala saponins can effectively ameliorate its gastrointestinal side effect.\nPolygala saponins are the major bioactive components in plants of the genus Polygala that exhibit therapeutic potential in various neurological diseases. This review provides directions for the future study of Polygala saponins and references for the clinical use of prescriptions containing Radix Polygalae for the treatment of neurological diseases.", "In this paper, a review of Metaheuristic Optimization Techniques (MOT) which are currently in use for optimization in a vast range of problems, is presented. MOT are known for their simplicity and stochastic nature and successfully applied to solve complex engineering problems. Although there exist various categories of MOT, the techniques from swarm intelligence is reviewed in this paper. An explanation of the theoretical foundation upon which each algorithm is based is provided, along with the relevant mathematical models that explain how an algorithm attempts to obtain the best solution to a problem. The paper also reviews the applications of swarm-based MOT to the control of the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). Particular attention is given to control of the DFIG for wind energy applications. Control of the DFIG is generally realized via the use of PI controllers. While various PI controller tuning methods are well established (such as the Ziegler-Nichols and Cohen-Coon methods), these methods produce satisfactory results, and often fail to meet the stringent levels of control presently required. Due to this fact, as well as the current success of MOT in engineering, the application of MOT to the control of the DFIG could be promising area of research. The results of the study show that although the various swarm-based MOT differ from each other in terms of aspects such as complexity and advantages, they are all based on the concept of randomness, and always attempt to produce the best possible solution. It was also observed that various swarm-based MOT displays the demerit of getting easily trapped in the local optimum, however various advancements have been proposed to correct such an issue. Based on the results of the application of these techniques to other engineering problems, their application to the DFIG could yield exceptional results.", "Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloys (SMAs) are smart materials able to recover their original shape under thermal stimulus. Near-net-shape NiTi SMA foils of 2 meters in length and width of 30 mm have been successfully produced by a planar flow casting facility at CSIRO, opening possibilities of wider applications of SMA foils. The study also focuses on establishing a fully automated experimental system for the characterisation of their reversible actuation, significantly improving SMA foils adaptation into real applications. Artificial Intelligence involving Computer Vision and Machine Learning based methods were successfully employed in the development of the automation SMA characterization process. The study finds that an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Regression model based predictive system experimented with over 175,000 video samples could achieve 99% overall prediction accuracy. Generalisation capability of the proposed system makes a significant contribution towards the efficient optimisation of the material design to produce high quality 30 mm SMA foils.", "We have implemented Smart Endoscopic Surgery (SES), a surgical system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the anatomical landmarks that expert surgeons base on to perform certain surgical maneuvers. No report has verified the use of AI-based support systems for surgery in clinical practice, and no evaluation method has been established. To evaluate the detection performance of SES, we have developed and established a new evaluation method by conducting a clinical feasibility trial.\nA single-center prospective clinical feasibility trial was conducted on 10 cases of LC performed at Oita University hospital. Subsequently, an external evaluation committee (EEC) evaluated the AI detection accuracy for each landmark using five-grade rubric evaluation and DICE coefficient. We defined LM-CBD as the expert surgeon's \"judge\" of the cystic bile duct in endoscopic images.\nThe average detection accuracy on the rubric by the EEC was 4.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 for the LM-CBD. The DICE coefficient between the AI detection area of the LM-CBD and the EEC members' evaluation was similar to the mean value of the DICE coefficient between the EEC members. The DICE coefficient was high score for the case that was highly evaluated by the EEC on a five-grade scale.\nThis is the first feasible clinical trial of an AI system designed for intraoperative use and to evaluate the AI system using an EEC. In the future, this concept of evaluation for the AI system would contribute to the development of new AI navigation systems for surgery.", "The artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted design of drug candidates with novel structures and desired properties has received significant attention in the recent past, so related areas of forward prediction that aim to discover chemical matters worth synthesizing and further experimental investigation.\nThe purpose behind developing AI-driven models is to explore the broader chemical space and suggest new drug candidate scaffolds with promising therapeutic value. Moreover, it is anticipated that such AI-based models may not only significantly reduce the cost and time but also decrease the attrition rate of drug candidates that fail to reach the desirable endpoints at the final stages of drug development. In an attempt to develop AI-based models for de novo drug design, numerous methods have been proposed by various study groups by applying machine learning and deep learning algorithms to chemical datasets. However, there are many challenges in obtaining accurate predictions, and real breakthroughs in de novo drug design are still scarce.\nIn this review, we explore the recent trends in developing AI-based models for de novo drug design to assess the current status, challenges, and opportunities in the field.\nThe consistently improved AI algorithms and the abundance of curated training chemical data indicate that AI-based de novo drug design should perform better than the current models. Improvements in the performance are warranted to obtain better outcomes in the form of potential drug candidates, which can perform well in in vivo conditions, especially in the case of more complex diseases.", "A novel artificial intelligence-based phenotyping approach to stratify patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been proposed, based on echocardiographic and haemodynamic data. This study aimed to analyse the recovery of extra-aortic valve cardiac damage in accordance with this novel stratification system following TAVR.\nThe proposed phenotyping approach was previously established employing data from 366 patients with severe AS from a bicentric registry. For this consecutive study, echocardiographic follow-up data, obtained on day 147\u00b175.1 after TAVR, were available from 247 patients (67.5%).\nCorrection of severe AS by TAVR significantly reduced the proportion of patients suffering from concurrent severe mitral regurgitation (from 9.29% to 3.64%, p value: 0.0015). Moreover, pulmonary artery pressures were ameliorated (estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure: from 47.2\u00b115.8\u2009to 43.3\u00b115.1\u2009mm\u2009Hg, p value: 0.0079). However, right heart dysfunction as well as the proportion of patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation remained unchanged. Clusters with persistent right heart dysfunction ultimately displayed 2-year survival rates of 69.2% (95% CI 56.6% to 84.7%) and 74.6% (95% CI 65.9% to 84.4%), which were significantly lower compared with clusters with little or no persistent cardiopulmonary impairment (88.3% (95% CI 83.3% to 93.5%) and 85.5% (95% CI 77.1% to 94.8%)).\nThis phenotyping approach preprocedurally identifies patients with severe AS, who will not recover from extra-aortic valve cardiac damage following TAVR and whose survival is therefore significantly reduced. Importantly, not the degree of pulmonary hypertension at initial presentation, but the irreversibility of right heart dysfunction determines prognosis.", "Remarkable progress in the fields of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to an increased number of applications of (data-driven) AI systems for the partial or complete control of safety-critical systems. Recently, ML solutions have been particularly popular. Such approaches are often met with concerns regarding their correct and safe execution, which is often caused by missing knowledge or intransparency of their exact functionality. The investigation and derivation of methods for the safety assessment of AI systems are thus of great importance. Among others, these issues are addressed in the field of AI Safety. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of this field by means of a systematic literature review with special focus on the area of highly automated driving, as well as to present a selection of approaches and methods for the safety assessment of AI systems. Particularly, validation, verification, and testing are considered in light of this context. In the review process, two distinguished classes of approaches have been identified: On the one hand established methods, either referring to already published standards or well-established concepts from multiple research areas outside ML and AI. On the other hand newly developed approaches, including methods tailored to the scope of ML and AI which gained importance only in recent years.", "Police officers are generally under long-term occupational stress. Good mental health ability enables them to better deal with emergencies and enhance their combat effectiveness. We aimed to develop the Police Mental Health Ability Scale (PMHAS) to provide a reference for police selection and ability training.\nThrough literature analysis, individual interviews, half-open and half-closed questionnaire surveys, and expert consultations, the components of police mental health ability (PMHA) were theoretically constructed. Then, we enrolled 824 in-service police officers who participated in the training in Chongqing City and Sichuan Province from November 2018 to January 2019 and recovered 767 valid questionnaires (recovery rate, 93.08%).\nExploratory factor analysis generated five factors for PMHAS, including cognitive intelligence, emotional catharsis, swift decisiveness, behavioral drive, and reward pursuit, accounting for 58.904% of the variance. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the model fit well (\u03c72/df\u00a0=\u00a01.117, RMSEA\u00a0=\u00a00.020, GFI\u00a0=\u00a00.948, CFI\u00a0=\u00a00.990, IFI\u00a0=\u00a00.990, TLI\u00a0=\u00a00.987). The correlation coefficients of factors (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.023\u2009~\u20090.580) were lower than that of each factor and total score (r\u00a0=\u00a00.477\u2009~\u20090.819). The Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients of PMHAS and its factors were 0.606-0.863, and the test-retest reliabilities were 0.602-0.732.\nThese results suggest that PMHAS is reliable and valid enough for measuring PMHA, which shows that it is a potentially valuable tool for assessing the mental health ability of police officers.", "How do humans, including toddlers, take knowledge from past experiences and apply this knowledge in new ways? Current approaches to human and artificial intelligence (AI) fail to offer satisfactory explanations. We suggest the explanation will be found in the coherence statistics of the individual time-extended episodes of human experience and the cognitive processes those statistics engage.", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as the preferred imaging modality for evaluating a wide range of pediatric medical conditions. Nevertheless, the long acquisition times associated with this technique can limit its widespread use in young children, resulting in motion-degraded or non-diagnostic studies. As a result, sedation or general anesthesia is often necessary to obtain diagnostic images, which has implications for the safety profile of MRI, the cost of the exam and the radiology department's clinical workflow. Over the last decade, several techniques have been developed to increase the speed of MRI, including parallel imaging, single-shot acquisition, controlled aliasing techniques, compressed sensing and artificial-intelligence-based reconstructions. These are advantageous because shorter examinations decrease the need for sedation and the severity of motion artifacts, increase scanner throughput, and improve system efficiency. In this review we discuss a framework for image acceleration in children that includes the synergistic use of state-of-the-art MRI hardware and optimized pulse sequences. The discussion is framed within the context of pediatric radiology and incorporates the authors' experience in deploying these techniques in routine clinical practice.", "The exponential rise in social media via microblogging sites like Twitter has sparked curiosity in sentiment analysis that exploits user feedback towards a targeted product or service. Considering its significance in business intelligence and decision-making, numerous efforts have been made in this area. However, lack of dictionaries, unannotated data, large-scale unstructured data, and low accuracies have plagued these approaches. Also, sentiment classification through classifier ensemble has been underexplored in literature. In this article, we propose a Semantic Relational Machine Learning (SRML) model that automatically classifies the sentiment of tweets by using classifier ensemble and optimal features. The model employs the Cascaded Feature Selection (CFS) strategy, a novel statistical assessment approach based on Wilcoxon rank sum test, univariate logistic regression assisted significant predictor test and cross-correlation test. It further uses the efficacy of word2vec-based continuous bag-of-words and n-gram feature extraction in conjunction with SentiWordNet for finding optimal features for classification. We experiment on six public Twitter sentiment datasets, the STS-Gold dataset, the Obama-McCain Debate (OMD) dataset, the healthcare reform (HCR) dataset and the SemEval2017 Task 4A, 4B and 4C on a heterogeneous classifier ensemble comprising fourteen individual classifiers from different paradigms. Results from the experimental study indicate that CFS supports in attaining a higher classification accuracy with up to 50% lesser features compared to count vectorizer approach. In Intra-model performance assessment, the Artificial Neural Network-Gradient Descent (ANN-GD) classifier performs comparatively better than other individual classifiers, but the Best Trained Ensemble (BTE) strategy outperforms on all metrics. In inter-model performance assessment with existing state-of-the-art systems, the proposed model achieved higher accuracy and outperforms more accomplished models employing quantum-inspired sentiment representation (QSR), transformer-based methods like BERT, BERTweet, RoBERTa and ensemble techniques. The research thus provides critical insights into implementing similar strategy into building more generic and robust expert system for sentiment analysis that can be leveraged across industries.", "DNA methylation has a significant effect on gene expression and can be associated with various diseases. Meta-analysis of available DNA methylation datasets requires development of a specific workflow for joint data processing.\nWe propose a comprehensive approach of combined DNA methylation datasets to classify controls and patients. The solution includes data harmonization, construction of machine learning classification models, dimensionality reduction of models, imputation of missing values, and explanation of model predictions by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms. We show that harmonization can improve classification accuracy by up to 20% when preprocessing methods of the training and test datasets are different. The best accuracy results were obtained with tree ensembles, reaching above 95% for Parkinson's disease. Dimensionality reduction can substantially decrease the number of features, without detriment to the classification accuracy. The best imputation methods achieve almost the same classification accuracy for data with missing values as for the original data. XAI approaches have allowed us to explain model predictions from both populational and individual perspectives.\nWe propose a methodologically valid and comprehensive approach to the classification of healthy individuals and patients with various diseases based on whole-blood DNA methylation data using Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia as examples. The proposed algorithm works better for the former pathology, characterized by a complex set of symptoms. It allows to solve data harmonization problems for meta-analysis of many different datasets, impute missing values, and build classification models of small dimensionality.", "Hydrogel-based wearable epidermal sensors (HWESs) have attracted widespread attention in health monitoring, especially considering their colorimetric readout capability. However, it remains challenging for HWESs to work at extreme temperatures with long term stability due to the existence of water. Herein, a wearable transparent epidermal sensor with thermal compatibility and long term stability for smart colorimetric multi-signals monitoring is developed, based on an anti-freezing and anti-drying hydrogel with high transparency (over 90% transmittance), high stretchability (up to 1500%) and desirable adhesiveness to various kinds of substrates. The hydrogel consists of polyacrylic acid, polyacrylamide, and tannic acid-coated cellulose nanocrystals in glycerin/water binary solvents. When glycerin readily forms strong hydrogen bonds with water, the hydrogel exhibits outstanding thermal compatibility. Furthermore, the hydrogel maintains excellent adhesion, stretchability, and transparency after long term storage (45 days) or at subzero temperatures (-20 \u00b0C). For smart colorimetric multi-signals monitoring, the freestanding smart colorimetric HWESs are utilized for simultaneously monitoring the pH, T and light, where colorimetric signals can be read and stored by artificial intelligence strategies in a real time manner. In summary, the developed wearable transparent epidermal sensor holds great potential for monitoring multi-signals with visible readouts in long term health monitoring.", "Identification of novel non-invasive biomarkers is critical for the early diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), especially for the accurate classification of pulmonary nodule. Here, a multiplexed assay is developed on an optimized nanoparticle-based laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry platform for the sensitive and selective detection of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs). Integrative SMFs based multi-modal platforms are constructed for the early detection of LUAD and the classification of pulmonary nodule. The dual modal model, metabolic fingerprints with protein tumor marker neural network (MP-NN), integrating SMFs with protein tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) via deep learning, shows superior performance compared with the single modal model Met-NN (p < 0.001). Based on MP-NN, the tri modal model MPI-RF integrating SMFs, tumor marker CEA, and image features via random forest demonstrates significantly higher performance than the clinical models (Mayo Clinic and Veterans Affairs) and the image artificial intelligence in pulmonary nodule classification (p < 0.001). The developed platforms would be promising tools for LUAD screening and pulmonary nodule management, paving the conceptual and practical foundation for the clinical application of omics tools.", "Medical professionals are increasingly required to use digital technologies as part of care delivery and this may represent a risk for medical error and subsequent malpractice liability. For example, if there is a medical error, should the error be attributed to the clinician or the artificial intelligence-based clinical decision-making system? In this article, we identify and discuss digital health technology-specific risks for malpractice liability and offer practical advice for the mitigation of malpractice risk.", "Social dysfunction is associated with decreased activity, employment difficulties, and poor prognosis in patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive functions, such as attention and processing speed, have been implicated in the social functions of schizophrenia patients; however, the relationship between cognitive functions and social functions remains unclear. Thus, understanding the factors that influence social functioning can aid the development of therapeutic strategies for schizophrenia. Herein, we retrospectively analyzed factors that influence social functioning in patients with schizophrenia.\nPatient background, intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, Japanese version of the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS-J) scores, the dose of antipsychotic drugs, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores, and the factors influencing each subscale of the Japanese version of the Social Functioning Scale (SFS-J) were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. The Bonferroni correction was applied to evaluate the correlation between each factor in the univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, independent variables were selected using a stepwise method. In each model, considering the sample size, the maximum number of variables extracted using the stepwise method was set to three. We then calculated the standard partial regression coefficient (standard \u03b2) between the SFS-J subscale scores and each factor.\nData from 36 patients were analyzed. The average age, illness duration, and total length of hospitalization were 57.8 years, 34.8 years, and 196.7 months, respectively. Of the seven significant correlations with the SFS-J subscale in the univariate analysis, only three were significant in the multivariate analysis model. According to the multivariable model, BACS-J verbal fluency positively correlated with SFS-J withdrawal, interpersonal communication, and employment/occupation. Moreover, BACS-J token motor and educational history were positively correlated with SFS-J recreation and SFS-J employment/occupation, respectively. PANSS scores, IQ scores, and doses of antipsychotic drugs did not show clear associations with SFS-J scores.\nIn conclusion, there were significant correlations between BACS-J subscale scores for cognitive functioning and SFS-J subscale scores for social functioning in patients with schizophrenia.", "This paper investigates origins and consequences of perceived profile text originality. The first goal was to examine whether the perceived originality of authentic online dating profile texts affects online daters' perceptions of attractiveness, and whether perceptions of (less) desired partner personality traits mediate this effect. Results showed the positive impact of perceived profile text originality on impression formation: text originality positively affects perceptions of intelligence and sense of humor, which improve impressions of attractiveness and boost dating intention. The second goal was to explore what profile text features increase perceptions of profile text originality. Results revealed profile texts which were stylistically original (e.g., include metaphors) and contained more and concrete self-disclosure statements were considered more original, explaining almost half of the variance in originality scores. Taken together, our results suggest that perceived originality in profile texts is manifested in both meaning and form, and is a balancing act between novelty and appropriateness.", "Background We sought to determine the role of obesity in adolescent men on development of atrial fibrillation (AF) and subsequent associated clinical outcomes in subjects diagnosed with AF. Methods and Results We conducted a nationwide, register-based, cohort study of 1\u2009704\u2009467 men (mean age, 18.3\u00b10.75\u2009years) enrolled in compulsory military service in Sweden from 1969 through 2005. Height and weight, blood pressure, fitness, muscle strength, intelligence quotient, and medical disorders were recorded at baseline. Records obtained from the National Inpatient Registry and the Cause of Death Register were used to determine incidence and clinical outcomes of AF. During a median follow-up of 32\u2009years (interquartile range, 24-41\u2009years), 36\u2009693 cases (mean age at diagnosis, 52.4\u00b110.6\u2009years) of AF were recorded. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for AF increased from 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.10) in individuals with body mass index (BMI) of 20.0 to <22.5\u2009kg/m2 to 3.72 (95% CI, 2.44-5.66) among men with BMI of 40.0 to 50.0\u2009kg/m2, compared with those with BMI of 18.5 to <20.0\u2009kg/m2. During a median follow-up of \u22486\u2009years in patients diagnosed with AF, we identified 3767 deaths, 3251 cases of incident heart failure, and 921 cases of ischemic stroke. The multivariable-adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality, incident heart failure, and ischemic stroke in AF-diagnosed men with baseline BMI >30\u2009kg/m2 compared with those with BMI <20\u2009kg/m2 were 2.86 (95% CI, 2.30-3.56), 3.42 (95% CI, 2.50-4.68), and 2.34 (95% CI, 1.52-3.61), respectively. Conclusions Increasing BMI in adolescent men is strongly associated with early AF, and with subsequent worse clinical outcomes in those diagnosed with AF with respect to all-cause mortality, incident heart failure, and ischemic stroke.", "6-core and 8-core trench-assisted heterogeneous fibres in standard cladding diameter are designed using artificial intelligence-based techniques including a cut-off wavelength regressor. The designs proposed here, for the first time, suppress crosstalk at 1550 nm of 8-core fibre to as low as -55 dB/km covering the whole S+C+L band while keeping coating loss below 0.001 dB/km. We compare them to reveal the influence of the additional cores in the 125 \u00b5m cladding diameter scenario. We report on the transmission characteristics and performance of the MCFs in terms of capacity and spatial spectral efficiency, including the influence of bandwidth, effective mode area, distance and crosstalk, for a range of transmission distances. The artificial intelligence-based method and insights given can be used to significantly speed up and tailor designs for a variety of telecom and datacom applications.", "Deaf signers and hearing non-signers have previously been shown to recruit partially different brain regions during simple arithmetic. In light of the triple code model, the differences were interpreted as relating to stronger recruitment of the verbal system of numerical processing, that is, left angular and inferior frontal gyrus, in hearing non-signers, and of the quantity system of numerical processing, that is, right horizontal intraparietal sulcus, for deaf signers. The main aim of the present study was to better understand similarities and differences in the neural correlates supporting arithmetic in deaf compared to hearing individuals. Twenty-nine adult deaf signers and 29 hearing non-signers were enrolled in an functional magnetic resonance imaging study of simple and difficult subtraction and multiplication. Brain imaging data were analyzed using whole-brain analysis, region of interest analysis, and functional connectivity analysis. Although the groups were matched on age, gender, and nonverbal intelligence, the deaf group performed generally poorer than the hearing group in arithmetic. Nevertheless, we found generally similar networks to be involved for both groups, the only exception being the involvement of the left inferior frontal gyrus. This region was activated significantly stronger for the hearing compared to the deaf group but showed stronger functional connectivity with the left superior temporal gyrus in the deaf, compared to the hearing, group. These results lend no support to increased recruitment of the quantity system in deaf signers. Perhaps the reason for performance differences is to be found in other brain regions not included in the original triple code model.", "It is an essential task to construct brain templates and analyze their anatomical structures in neurological and cognitive science. Generally, templates constructed from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a group of subjects can provide a standard reference space for analyzing the structural and functional characteristics of the group. With recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, it is desirable to explore AI registration methods for quantifying age-specific brain variations and tendencies across different ages. In this article, we present an AI-based age-specific template construction (called ASTC) framework for longitudinal structural brain analysis using T1-weighted MRIs of 646 subjects from 18 to 82\u2009years old collected from four medical centers. Altogether, 13 longitudinal templates were constructed at a 5-year age interval using ASTC, and tissue segmentation and substructure parcellation were performed for analysis across different age groups. The results indicated consistent changes in brain structures along with aging and demonstrated the capability of ASTC for longitudinal neuroimaging study.", "Passive listening to music, without sound production or evident movement, is long known to activate motor control regions. Nevertheless, the exact neuroanatomical correlates of the auditory-motor association and its underlying neural mechanisms have not been fully determined. Here, based on a NeuroSynth meta-analysis and three original fMRI paradigms of music perception, we show that the long-ignored pre-motor region, area 55b, an anatomically unique and functionally intriguing region, is a core hub of music perception. Moreover, results of a brain-behavior correlation analysis implicate neural entrainment as the underlying mechanism of area 55b's contribution to music perception. In view of the current results and prior literature, area 55b is proposed as a keystone of sensorimotor integration, a fundamental brain machinery underlying simple to hierarchically complex behaviors. Refining the neuroanatomical and physiological understanding of sensorimotor integration is expected to have a major impact on various fields, from brain disorders to artificial general intelligence.", "There is no escaping\u00a0Internet's favorite buzzword for 2022: The Metaverse. Everyone is talking about it, but only a few know what it is or how it works. One can look at the Metaverse as a 3D model of the Internet where it is possible to spend your reality parallel to the virtual world. In broad terms, Metaverse can be explained as a virtual space, graphically rich, leaning towards verisimilitude where people can do all sorts of things they do in real-life such as shop, play, socialize, and party. The pandemic has accelerated innovations in the digital age. Looking beyond revolutions in telehealth, payments, remote monitoring, and secure data-sharing are other essential innovations in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and blockchain technology. The Metaverse is still in its nascent stage and evolving continuously, having a huge potential in health care to combine the technologies of AI, AR/VR, web 3.0, Internet of medical devices, and quantum computing, along with robotics to\u00a0give a new direction to healthcare systems. From improving surgical precision to therapeutic usage and more, the Metaverse can bring significant\u00a0changes to the industry.", "In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in clinical digital pathology (DP). Hardware and software platforms have matured and become more affordable, and advances in artificial intelligence promise to transform the practice of pathology. At our institution, we are launching a stepwise process of DP adoption which will eventually encompass our entire workflow. Out of necessity, we began by establishing a whole slide imaging (WSI)-based frozen section service.\nWe proceeded in a systematic manner by first assembling a team of key stakeholders. We carefully evaluated the various options for digitizing frozen sections before deciding that a WSI-based solution made the most sense for us. We used a formalized evaluation system to quantify performance metrics that were relevant to us. After deciding on a WSI-based system, we likewise carefully considered the various whole slide scanners and digital slide management systems available before making decisions.\nDuring formal evaluation by pathologists, the WSI-based system outperformed competing platforms. Although implementation was relatively complex, we have been happy with the results and have noticed significant improvements in our frozen section turnaround time. Our users have been happy with the slide management system, which we plan on utilizing in future DP efforts.\nThere are various options for digitizing frozen section slides. Although WSI-based systems are more complex and expensive than some alternatives, they perform well and may make sense for institutions with a pre-existing or planned larger DP infrastructure.", "The Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) turns passive fiber sensors into learning machines. It can be used to integrate intelligent nodes into a multi-dimensional sensing system. In this study, the temperature measurement system based on Brillouin Gain Spectrum (BGS) test setup is creatively implemented with the AIoT architecture; the training and testing stages of the neural network are divided into different layers of equipment to improve performance and reduce the network traffic. To enable the lightweight and low-power consumption edge computing device to extract accurate temperature from the BGS during testing, we have integrated the post-processing method inspired by curve fitting into the machine learning and proposed the efficient digital resampling filter. The resampling filter approach is achieved by the peak range algorithm with Gauss differential operator and digital band-pass filter. The evaluation results for different methods on the BGS datasets show the superior performance of our approach. Notably, the approach can increase temperature extraction accuracy and compress the sampling data. The RMSEA of the extraction temperature is 0.5635, which can bring an almost 21% accuracy increase over the classic method. Compared with the classic method of processing the original data on the same hardware platform, the amount of data post-processed by the filter is reduced by 75%; the time consumption is reduced by 22%.", "We present a benchmark study of autonomous, chemical agents exhibiting associative learning of an environmental feature. Associative learning systems have been widely studied in cognitive science and artificial intelligence but are most commonly implemented in highly complex or carefully engineered systems, such as animal brains, artificial neural networks, DNA computing systems, and gene regulatory networks, among others. The ability to encode environmental information and use it to make simple predictions is a benchmark of biological resilience and underpins a plethora of adaptive responses in the living hierarchy, spanning prey animal species anticipating the arrival of predators to epigenetic systems in microorganisms learning environmental correlations. Given the ubiquitous and essential presence of learning behaviors in the biosphere, we aimed to explore whether simple, nonliving dissipative structures could also exhibit associative learning. Inspired by previous modeling of associative learning in chemical networks, we simulated simple systems composed of long- and short-term memory chemical species that could encode the presence or absence of temporal correlations between two external species. The ability to learn this association was implemented in Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion spots, emergent chemical patterns that exhibit self-replication and homeostasis. With the novel ability of associative learning, we demonstrate that simple chemical patterns can exhibit a broad repertoire of lifelike behavior, paving the way for in vitro studies of autonomous chemical learning systems, with potential relevance to artificial life, origins of life, and systems chemistry. The experimental realization of these learning behaviors in protocell or coacervate systems could advance a new research direction in astrobiology, since our system significantly reduces the lower bound on the required complexity for autonomous chemical learning.", "To outline the use of cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI)-driven video analytics (CAVs) in minimally invasive surgery and to propose their potential as a virtual portfolio for trainee and established surgeons.\u00a0 Methods: An independent online demonstration was requested from three platforms, namely Theator (Palo Alto, California, USA), Touch Surgery\u2122 (Medtronic, London, England, UK), and C-SATS\u00ae (Seattle, Washington, USA). The assessed domains were online and app-based accessibility, the ability for timely trainee feedback, and AI integration for operation-specific steps and critical views.\nThe CAVs enable users to record surgeries with the advantage of limitless video storage through clouding and smart integration into theatre settings.\u00a0This can be used to view surgeries and review trainee\u00a0videos through a medium of communication and sharing with the ability to provide feedback. Theator\u00a0and\u00a0C-SATS\u00ae provide their users with surgical skills scoring systems with\u00a0customizable options that can be used to provide structured feedback to trainees. Additionally, AI plays an important role in all three platforms by providing time-based analysis of steps and highlighting critical milestones.\u00a0 Conclusion:\u00a0Cloud-based AI-driven video analytics\u00a0is an emerging new technology that enables users to store, analyze, and review videos. This technology has the potential to improve training, governance, and standardization procedures. Moreover, with the future adaptation of the technology, CAVs can be integrated into the trainees' portfolios as part of their virtual curriculum. This can enable a structured assessment of a surgeon's progression and degree of experience throughout their surgical career.", "In order to meet people's demand for intelligent management of daily life and health, manufacturing and developing humidity monitoring equipment with convenience, high sensitivity, easy miniaturization, and low cost is particularly important in the era of rapid development of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. Polyaniline (PANI) is an attractive humidity sensing material due to its designable functional properties. However, PANI modified polyoxometalates (POMs) for humidity sensing are still rare. As a proof of concept, a novel moisture sensing composite material was obtained based on PANI and a novel 1D rare-earth-substituted phospho(III)tungstate [H2N(CH3)2]9Na3H6[Ce2(H2O)3W5O13(C2O4)][HPIIIW9O33]2[(HPIII)2W15O54]\u00b742H2O (1). Notably, the anion structure of 1 contains trivacant Keggin-type [B-\u03b1-HPIIIW9O33]8- and Dawson-like [(HPIII)2W15O54]10- subunits linked by a heterometallic [Ce2(H2O)3W5O32(C2O4)]30- cluster. Furthermore, the 1/PANI composite shows a typical semiconductive characteristic with a \"band-like\" conductive mechanism. The fabricated 1/PANI-based humidity sensing device exhibits a broad sensing range (11\u223c97% relative humidity), fast response/recovery time (3.45 s/3.24 s), good repeatability, and long-term stability (over 3 months). Additionally, the possible sensing mechanism is proposed. This work offers an enormous possibility for the design of high-performance humidity sensing materials through POM material chemistry.", "Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is important for diagnosis and risk stratification of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. However, collection of information from large numbers of CMR reports by manual review is time-consuming, error-prone and costly. Natural language processing (NLP) is an artificial intelligence method for automated extraction of information from narrative text including text in CMR reports in electronic health records (EHR). Our objective was to assess whether NLP can accurately extract diagnosis of HCM from CMR reports.\nAn NLP system with two tiers was developed for information extraction from narrative text in CMR reports; the first tier extracted information regarding HCM diagnosis while the second extracted categorical and numeric concepts for HCM classification. We randomly allocated 200 HCM patients with CMR reports from 2004 to 2018 into training (100 patients with 185 CMR reports) and testing sets (100 patients with 206 reports).\nNLP algorithms demonstrated very high performance compared to manual annotation. The algorithm to extract HCM diagnosis had accuracy of 0.99. The accuracy for categorical concepts included HCM morphologic subtype 0.99, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve 0.96, mitral regurgitation 0.93, left ventricular (LV) obstruction 0.94, location of obstruction 0.92, apical pouch 0.98, LV delayed enhancement 0.93, left atrial enlargement 0.99 and right atrial enlargement 0.98. Accuracy for numeric concepts included maximal LV wall thickness 0.96, LV mass 0.99, LV mass index 0.98, LV ejection fraction 0.98 and right ventricular ejection fraction 0.99.\nNLP identified and classified HCM from CMR narrative text reports with very high performance.", "At present, the underwater autonomous operation based on monocular vision has poor accuracy and low intelligence, due mainly to the low accuracy of pose estimation. To solve this problem, we propose a real-time pose estimation method for underwater cylinders and cuboids. The first challenge in processing underwater images is image degradation, which is overcome by using a scale-optimized dark channel prior dehazing algorithm. The lightweight improved You Only Look Once v5 is used to obtain the pixel information of the four control points and obtain the bounding box close to the edge of the object, which makes the pose estimation more accurate. We then propose an underwater optical imaging model that overcomes the challenges posed by refraction. Finally, the improved algorithm based on the perspective-n-point problem is used to estimate the pose of the object in real time. We deployed the algorithm in the edge computing device NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and achieved excellent performance. The experimental results show that our method can achieve high-precision monocular pose estimation without producing a large-scale pose dataset, and can be used to provide reliable information for underwater autonomous operation tasks.", "Postmortem interval (PMI) estimation has always been a major challenge in forensic science. Conventional methods for predicting PMI are based on postmortem phenomena, metabolite or biochemical changes, and insect succession. Because postmortem microbial succession follows a certain temporal regularity, the microbiome has been shown to be a potentially effective tool for PMI estimation in the last decade. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies shed new lights on forensic medicine through analyzing big data, establishing prediction models, assisting in decision-making, etc. With the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and AI techniques, it is possible for forensic practitioners to improve the dataset of microbial communities and obtain detailed information on the inventory of specific ecosystems, quantifications of community diversity, descriptions of their ecological function, and even their application in legal medicine. This review describes the postmortem succession of the microbiome in cadavers and their surroundings, and summarizes the application, advantages, problems, and future strategies of AI-based microbiome analysis for PMI estimation.", "The rapid development of artificial intelligence places high demands on human-machine interfaces. Various types of huma-machine interfaces have been implemented, including smart keyboards, electronic skins, and wearable motion sensors. Handwriting behavior has a high degree of interaction freedom, and handwriting characteristics offer high-security standards for human-machine systems. Herein, we propose a portable smart pen integrated with triboelectric displacement vector sensors to trace handwriting trajectories for human-machine interactions and biometric identification. A triboelectric pressure sensor array is evenly distributed along the pen case to sense displacement vectors, and an additional triboelectric sensor is placed on top of the pen to detect vertical force. By leveraging the resin pen refill as a tribopositive material and a nanowired polyethylene tribonegative layer attached to a Cu electrode, triboelectric signals are generated during the writing/moving process. The calculation and analysis of the sensor signals enable the recognition of handwritten patterns, including Latin letters and Arabic numerals. Moreover, the smart pen can be used to authenticate users based on their unique handwriting patterns, which can help take human-machine interfaces and cyber security to the next level. Furthermore, a custom smart pen operation mode that enables the control of a slide presentation demonstrates the smart pen's potential for various human-machine interface applications.", "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of rehabilitation is growing rapidly. Therefore, there is a need to understand how physical therapists (PTs) perceive AI technologies in clinical practice.\nThis study aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitude of PTs regarding AI applications in rehabilitation based on multiple explanatory factors.\nA web-based Google Form survey, which was divided into 4 sections, was used to collect the data. A total of 317 PTs participated voluntarily in the study.\nThe PTs' knowledge about AI applications in rehabilitation was lower than their knowledge about AI in general. We found a statistically significant difference in the PTs' knowledge regarding AI applications in the rehabilitation field based on sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.43, 95% CI 1.53-3.87; P<.001). In addition, experience (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.11-2.87; P=.02) and educational qualification (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.05-2.70; P=.03) were found to be significant predictors of knowledge about AI applications. PTs who work in the nonacademic sector and who had <10 years of experience had positive attitudes regarding AI.\nAI technologies have been integrated into many physical therapy practices through the automation of clinical tasks. Therefore, PTs are encouraged to take advantage of the widespread development of AI technologies and enrich their knowledge about, and enhance their practice with, AI applications.", "The purpose of this study was to use the neural network to distinguish optic edema (ODE), and optic atrophy from normal fundus images and try to use visualization to explain the artificial intelligence methods.\nThree hundred and sixty-seven images of ODE, 206 images of optic atrophy, and 231 images of normal fundus were used, which were provided by two hospitals. A set of image preprocessing and data enhancement methods were created and a variety of different neural network models, such as VGG16, VGG19, Inception V3, and 50-layer Deep Residual Learning (ResNet50) were used. The accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve under different networks were analyzed to evaluate the performance of models. Besides, CAM (class activation mapping) was utilized to find the focus of neural network and visualization of neural network with feature fusion.\nOur image preprocessing and data enhancement method significantly improved the accuracy of model performance by about 10%. Among the networks, VGG16 had the best effect, as the accuracy of ODE, optic atrophy and normal fundus were 98, 90, and 95%, respectively. The macro-average and micro-average of VGG16 both reached 0.98. From CAM we can clearly find out that the focus area of the network is near the optic cup. From feature fusion images, we can find out the difference between the three types fundus images.\nThrough image preprocessing, data enhancement, and neural network training, we applied artificial intelligence to identify ophthalmic diseases, acquired the focus area through CAM, and identified the difference between the three ophthalmic diseases through neural network middle layers visualization. With the help of assistant diagnosis, ophthalmologists can evaluate cases more precisely and more clearly.", "The attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has a negative impact on the child's educational life and relationships with the social environment during childhood and adolescence. The connection between temperament traits and The attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has been proven by various studies. As far as we know, there is no machine learning study to diagnose. The attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in a dataset created using temperament characteristics.\nMachine learning-based semi-automatic/fully automatic expert decision support systems are frequently used for the diagnosis of various diseases. In this study, it was aimed to reveal the success of a semi-automatic expert decision support system in the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder by using temperament characteristics. The high classification success achieved is a resource for a potential diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder expert decision support system. In this respect, this study includes original qualities and innovations.\nMany different deep learning methods were used in the research. Deep learning methods are models that achieve high success by using a large number of images in various image processing competitions. The images of the signals in the data set were first obtained by Continuous Wavelet Transform. The highest classification success in our data set was obtained with the Squeeze Net model with 88.33%.\nThe model we propose shows that an automatic system based on artificial intelligence can be created, as well as revealing the relationship between temperament characteristics in the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity in the data set we created.", "Ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes are subtle and transient in patients with suspected non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE)-acute coronary syndrome. However, the out-of-hospital ECG is not routinely used during subsequent evaluation at the emergency department. Therefore, we sought to compare the diagnostic performance of out-of-hospital and ED ECG and evaluate the incremental gain of artificial intelligence-augmented ECG analysis.\nThis prospective observational cohort study recruited patients with out-of-hospital chest pain. We retrieved out-of-hospital-ECG obtained by paramedics in the field and the first ED ECG obtained by nurses during inhospital evaluation. Two independent and blinded reviewers interpreted ECG dyads in mixed order per practice recommendations. Using 179 morphological ECG features, we trained, cross-validated, and tested a random forest classifier to augment non ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) diagnosis.\nOur sample included 2,122 patients (age 59 [16]; 53% women; 44% Black, 13.5% confirmed acute coronary syndrome). The rate of diagnostic ST elevation and ST depression were 5.9% and 16.2% on out-of-hospital-ECG and 6.1% and 12.4% on ED ECG, with \u223c40% of changes seen on out-of-hospital-ECG persisting and \u223c60% resolving. Using expert interpretation of out-of-hospital-ECG alone gave poor baseline performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), sensitivity, and negative predictive values of 0.69, 0.50, and 0.92. Using expert interpretation of serial ECG changes enhanced this performance (AUC 0.80, sensitivity 0.61, and specificity 0.93). Interestingly, augmenting the out-of-hospital-ECG alone with artificial intelligence algorithms boosted its performance (AUC 0.83, sensitivity 0.75, and specificity 0.95), yielding a net reclassification improvement of 29.5% against expert ECG interpretation.\nIn this study, 60% of diagnostic ST changes resolved prior to hospital arrival, making the ED ECG suboptimal for the inhospital evaluation of NSTE-ACS. Using serial ECG changes or incorporating artificial intelligence-augmented analyses would allow correctly reclassifying one in 4 patients with suspected NSTE-ACS.", "Aging accelerates during midlife. Researches have shown the health benefits of mind-body intervention (MBI). However, whether MBI is involved with aging process has not been well understood. In this study, we approach to examine the relations of MBI with this process by investigating an aging marker of the peripheral blood, blood chemistry, and self-report questionnaires. A quasi-experimental design was applied. Experienced MBI practitioners participated in a 3-month intensive meditation training, while the age, gender-matched MBI-na\u00efve controls led a normal daily life. Measurements were taken at before and after the 3 months for relative telomere length (RTL), blood chemistry, and self-report questionnaires including items about sleep quality, somatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, stress, emotional intelligence (EI), and self-regulation. For RTL, the repeated measures analysis of variance showed a significant group*time interaction (P = .013) with a significant post hoc result (P = .030) within the control group: RTL was significantly reduced in the control while it was maintained in the meditation group. In repeated measures analysis of variance for blood chemistries, there were significant group differences between the groups in glucose and total protein. In the post hoc comparison analysis, at post measurements, the meditation group exhibited significantly lower values than the control group in both glucose and total protein. There were significant group-wise differences in the correlations of RTL with triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase. Any of self-report results did not show significant changes in group*time interaction. However, there were group differences with significant (P < .05) or a tendency (.05 < P < .1) level. There were significant improvements in depression, stress and EI as well as tendencies of improvement in sleep quality and anxiety, in the meditation group compared to the control group. Our results suggest that meditation practice may have a potential to modify aging process in molecular cellular level combined with changes in psychological dimension.", "Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is widely utilized to support critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance CRRT delivery, but evidence is limited. We reviewed existing literature on the utilization of AI in CRRT with the objective of identifying current gaps in evidence and research considerations. We conducted a scoping review focusing on the development or use of AI-based tools in patients receiving CRRT. Ten papers were identified; 6 of 10 (60%) published in 2021, and 6 of 10 (60%) focused on machine learning models to augment CRRT delivery. All innovations were in the design/early validation phase of development. Primary research interests focused on early indicators of CRRT need, prognostication of mortality and kidney recovery, and identification of risk factors for mortality. Secondary research priorities included dynamic CRRT monitoring, predicting CRRT-related complications, and automated data pooling for point-of-care analysis. Literature gaps included prospective validation and implementation, biases ascertainment, and evaluation of AI-generated health care disparities. Research on AI applications to enhance CRRT delivery has grown exponentially in the last years, but the field remains premature. There is a need to evaluate how these applications could enhance bedside decision-making capacity and assist structure and processes of CRRT delivery.", "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is promising in interacting with machines through electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. The compact end-to-end neural network model for generalized BCIs, EEGNet, has been implemented in hardware to get near sensor intelligence, but without enough efficiency. To utilize EEGNet in low-power wearable device for long-term use, this paper proposes an efficient EEGNet inference accelerator. Firstly, the EEGNet model is compressed by embedded channel selection, normalization merging, and product quantization. The customized accelerator based on the compressed model is then designed. The multilayer convolutions are achieved by reusing multiplying-accumulators and processing elements (PEs) to minimize area of logic circuits, and the weights and intermediate results are quantized to minimize memory sizes. The PEs are clock-gated to save power. Experimental results in FPGA on three datasets show the good generalizing ability of the proposed design across three BCI diagrams, which only consumes 3.31% area and 1.35% power compared to the one-to-one parallel design. The speedup factors of 1.4, 3.5, and 3.7 are achieved by embedded channel selection with negligible loss of accuracy (-0.80%). The presented accelerator is also synthesized in 65 nm CMOS low power (LP) process and consumes 0.23M gates, 24.4 ms/inference, 0.267 mJ/inference, which is 87.22% more efficient than the implementation of EEGNet in a RISC-V MCU realized in 40 nm CMOS LP process in terms of area, and 20.77% more efficient in terms of energy efficiency on BCIC-IV-2a dataset.", "Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-machine interface (BMI) has been utilized to help patients regain motor function and has recently been validated for its use in healthy people because of its ability to directly decipher human intentions. In particular, neurolinguistic research using EEGs has been investigated as an intuitive and naturalistic communication tool between humans and machines. In this study, the human mind directly decoded the neural languages based on speech imagery using the proposed deep neurolinguistic learning. Through real-time experiments, we evaluated whether BMI-based cooperative tasks between multiple users could be accomplished using a variety of neural languages. We successfully demonstrated a BMI system that allows a variety of scenarios, such as essential activity, collaborative play, and emotional interaction. This outcome presents a novel BMI frontier that can interact at the level of human-like intelligence in real time and extends the boundaries of the communication paradigm.", "In theory, building automation and management systems (BAMSs) can provide all the components and functionalities required for analyzing and operating buildings. However, in reality, these systems can only ensure the control of heating ventilation and air conditioning system systems. Therefore, many other tasks are left to the operator, e.g. evaluating buildings' performance, detecting abnormal energy consumption, identifying the changes needed to improve efficiency, ensuring the security and privacy of end-users, etc. To that end, there has been a movement for developing artificial intelligence (AI) big data analytic tools as they offer various new and tailor-made solutions that are incredibly appropriate for practical buildings' management. Typically, they can help the operator in (i) analyzing the tons of connected equipment data; and; (ii) making intelligent, efficient, and on-time decisions to improve the buildings' performance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic survey on using AI-big data analytics in BAMSs. It covers various AI-based tasks, e.g. load forecasting, water management, indoor environmental quality monitoring, occupancy detection, etc. The first part of this paper adopts a well-designed taxonomy to overview existing frameworks. A comprehensive review is conducted about different aspects, including the learning process, building environment, computing platforms, and application scenario. Moving on, a critical discussion is performed to identify current challenges. The second part aims at providing the reader with insights into the real-world application of AI-big data analytics. Thus, three case studies that demonstrate the use of AI-big data analytics in BAMSs are presented, focusing on energy anomaly detection in residential and office buildings and energy and performance optimization in sports facilities. Lastly, future directions and valuable recommendations are identified to improve the performance and reliability of BAMSs in intelligent buildings.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a rapidly increasing role in clinical care. Many of these systems, for instance, deep learning-based applications using multilayered Artificial Neural Nets, exhibit epistemic opacity in the sense that they preclude comprehensive human understanding. In consequence, voices from industry, policymakers, and research have suggested trust as an attitude for engaging with clinical AI systems. Yet, in the philosophical and ethical literature on medical AI, the notion of trust remains fiercely debated. Trust skeptics hold that talking about trust in nonhuman agents constitutes a category error and worry about the concept being misused for ethics washing. Proponents of trust have responded to these worries from various angles, disentangling different concepts and aspects of trust in AI, potentially organized in layers or dimensions. Given the substantial disagreements across these accounts of trust and the important worries about ethics washing, we embrace a diverging strategy here. Instead of aiming for a positive definition of the elements and nature of trust in AI, we proceed ex negativo, that is we look at cases where trust or distrust are misplaced. Comparing these instances with trust expedited in doctor-patient relationships, we systematize these instances and propose a taxonomy of both misplaced trust and distrust. By inverting the perspective and focusing on negative examples, we develop an account that provides useful ethical constraints for decisions in clinical as well as regulatory contexts and that highlights how we should not engage with medical AI.", "Innovations in robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence are being rapidly adopted as tools of \"digital surgery\". Despite its quickly emerging role, digital surgery is not well understood. A recent study defines the term itself, and then specifies ethical issues specific to the field. These include privacy and public trust, consent, and litigation.", "Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) that are developed based on artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) approaches carry transformative potentials in improving the way neonatal care is practiced. From the use of the data available from electronic health records to physiological sensors and imaging modalities, CDSS can be used to predict clinical outcomes (such as mortality rate, hospital length of state, or surgical outcome) or early warning signs of diseases in neonates. However, only a limited number of clinical decision support systems for neonatal care are currently deployed in healthcare facilities or even implemented during pilot trials (or prospective studies). This is mostly due to the unresolved challenges in developing a real-time supported clinical decision support system, which mainly consists of three phases: model development, model evaluation, and real-time deployment. In this review, we introduce some of the pivotal challenges and factors we must consider during the implementation of real-time supported CDSS.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) research is transforming the range tools and technologies available to pathologists, leading to potentially faster, personalized and more accurate diagnoses for patients. However, to see the use of tools for patient benefit and achieve this safely, the implementation of any algorithm must be underpinned by high quality evidence from research that is understandable, replicable, usable and inclusive of details needed for critical appraisal of potential bias. Evidence suggests that reporting guidelines can improve the completeness of reporting of research, especially with good awareness of guidelines. The quality of evidence provided by abstracts alone is profoundly important, as they influence the decision of a researcher to read a paper, attend a conference presentation or include a study in a systematic review. AI abstracts at two international pathology conferences were assessed to establish completeness of reporting against the STARD for Abstracts criteria. This reporting guideline is for abstracts of diagnostic accuracy studies and includes a checklist of 11 essential items required to accomplish satisfactory reporting of such an investigation. A total of 3488 abstracts were screened from the United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology annual meeting 2019 and the 31st European Congress of Pathology (ESP Congress). Of these, 51 AI diagnostic accuracy abstracts were identified and assessed against the STARD for Abstracts criteria for completeness of reporting. Completeness of reporting was suboptimal for the 11 essential criteria, a mean of 5.8 (SD 1.5) items were detailed per abstract. Inclusion was variable across the different checklist items, with all abstracts including study objectives and no abstracts including a registration number or registry. Greater use and awareness of the STARD for Abstracts criteria could improve completeness of reporting and further consideration is needed for areas where AI studies are vulnerable to bias.", "Cytology is the study of whole cells in diagnostic pathology. Unlike standard histologic thinly sliced specimens, cytologic preparations consist of preparations of whole cells where cells commonly cluster and aggregate. As such, cytology preparations are generally much thicker than histologic slides, resulting in large patches of defocus when examined under the microscope. A diagnostic aggregate of cells often cannot be viewed in focus together, requiring pathologists to continually manipulate the focal plane, complicating the task of accurately assessing the entire cellular aggregate and thus in making a diagnosis. Further, it is extremely difficult to acquire useful uniformly in-focus digital images of cytology preparations for applications such as remote diagnostic evaluations and artificial intelligence models. The predominant current method to address this issue is to acquire digital images at multiple focal planes of the entire slide, which demands long scanning time, complex and expensive scanning systems, and huge storage capacity.\nHere we report a unique imaging method that can acquire cytologic images efficiently and computationally render all-in-focus digital images that are highly compact.\nThis method applies a metric-based digital refocusing to microscopy data collected with a Fourier ptychographic microscope (FPM). The digitally refocused patches of images are then synthesized into an all-in-focus image.\nWe report all-in-focus FPM results of thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology samples, demonstrating our method's ability to overcome the height variance of 30\u202f\u03bcm caused by cell aggregation, and rendering images at high resolution (corresponds to a standard microscope with objective NA of 0.75) and that are all-in-focus.\nThis technology is applicable to standard microscopes, and we believe can have an impact on diagnostic accuracy as well as ease and speed of diagnosing challenging specimens. While we focus on cytology slides here, we anticipate this technology's advantages will translate well for histology applications. This technique also addresses the issue of remote rapid evaluation of cytology preparations. Finally, we believe that by resolving the focus heterogeneity issues in standard digital images, this technique is a critical advance for applying machine learning to cytology specimens.", "Early confirmation or ruling out biliary atresia (BA) is essential for infants with delayed onset of jaundice. In the current practice, percutaneous liver biopsy and intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) remain the golden standards for diagnosis. In Taiwan, the diagnostic methods are invasive and can only be performed in selective medical centers. However, referrals from primary physicians and local pediatricians are often delayed because of lacking clinical suspicions. Ultrasounds (US) are common screening tools in local hospitals and clinics, but the pediatric hepatobiliary US particularly requires well-trained imaging personnel. The meaningful comprehension of US is highly dependent on individual experience. For screening BA through human observation on US images, the reported sensitivity and specificity were achieved by pediatric radiologists, pediatric hepatobiliary experts, or pediatric surgeons. Therefore, this research developed a tool based on deep learning models for screening BA to assist pediatric US image reading by general physicians and pediatricians.\nDe-identified hepatobiliary US images of 180 patients from Taichung Veterans General Hospital were retrospectively collected under the approval of the Institutional Review Board. Herein, the top network models of ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition and other network models commonly used for US image recognition were included for further study to classify US images as BA or non-BA. The performance of different network models was expressed by the confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curve. There were two methods proposed to solve disagreement by US image classification of a single patient. The first and second methods were the positive-dominance law and threshold law. During the study, the US images of three successive patients suspected to have BA were classified by the trained models.\nAmong all included patients contributing US images, 41 patients were diagnosed with BA by surgical intervention and 139 patients were either healthy controls or had non-BA diagnoses. In this study, a total of 1,976 original US images were enrolled. Among them, 417 and 1,559 raw images were from patients with BA and without BA, respectively. Meanwhile, ShuffleNet achieved the highest accuracy of 90.56% using the same training parameters as compared with other network models. The sensitivity and specificity were 67.83% and 96.76%, respectively. In addition, the undesired false-negative prediction was prevented by applying positive-dominance law to interpret different images of a single patient with an acceptable false-positive rate, which was 13.64%. For the three consecutive patients with delayed obstructive jaundice with IOC confirmed diagnoses, ShuffleNet achieved accurate diagnoses in two patients.\nThe current study provides a screening tool for identifying possible BA by hepatobiliary US images. The method was not designed to replace liver biopsy or IOC, but to decrease human error for interpretations of US. By applying the positive-dominance law to ShuffleNet, the false-negative rate and the specificities were 0 and 86.36%, respectively. The trained deep learning models could aid physicians other than pediatric surgeons, pediatric gastroenterologists, or pediatric radiologists, to prevent misreading pediatric hepatobiliary US images. The current artificial intelligence (AI) tool is helpful for screening BA in the real world.", "Today, with the rapid development of the Internet, society has entered the era of \"information explosion.\" Financial data are a particularly important part of network information, and it has also reached a new level of public demand. The frequent appearance of words such as \"carbon peak\" and \"green\" indicates the transition of national policies to the field of sustainable development. Sustainable development would become an inevitable choice, and a green supply chain has become a new trend under this policy background. Supply chain finance uses the ideas and methods of key supply management to provide financial services to related enterprises. If an enterprise cannot acquire, organize, and use the information and data in the supply chain, it is likely to be outdated or even abandoned in the short term. This paper takes the artificial intelligence green financial system as the background and uses the cooperation theory model to analyze and predict the big data information of the enterprise supply chain. It realizes the transformation of information into sustainable resources for enterprises and releases the huge potential of big data. In this model, this model not only helped the company's overall profit increase by about 8.79% but also provided scientific support for corporate decision-making and promoted the development of the company.", "Online adaptive radiation therapy (RT) using hybrid magnetic resonance linear accelerators (MR-Linacs) can administer a tailored radiation dose at each treatment fraction. Daily MR imaging followed by organ and target segmentation adjustments allow to capture anatomical changes, improve target volume coverage, and reduce the risk of side effects. The introduction of automatic segmentation techniques could help to further improve the online adaptive workflow by shortening the re-contouring time and reducing intra- and inter-observer variability. In fractionated RT, prior knowledge, such as planning images and manual expert contours, is usually available before irradiation, but not used by current artificial intelligence-based autocontouring\u00a0approaches.\nThe goal of this study was to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic segmentation of bladder, rectum (organs at risk, OARs), and clinical target volume (CTV) for prostate cancer patients treated at 0.35 T MR-Linacs. Furthermore, we tested the CNNs generalization on data from independent facilities and compared them with the MR-Linac treatment planning system (TPS) propagated structures currently used in clinics. Finally, expert planning delineations were utilized for patient- (PS) and facility-specific (FS) transfer learning to improve auto-segmentation of CTV and OARs on fraction\u00a0images.\nIn this study, data from fractionated treatments at 0.35\u00a0T MR-Linacs were leveraged to develop a 3D U-Net-based automatic segmentation. Cohort C1 had 73 planning images and cohort C2 had 19 planning and 240 fraction images. The baseline models (BMs) were trained solely on C1 planning data using 53 MRIs for training and 10 for validation. To assess their accuracy, the models were tested on three data subsets: (i) 10 C1 planning images not used for training, (ii) 19 C2 planning, and (iii) 240 C2 fraction images. BMs also served as a starting point for FS and PS transfer learning, where the planning images from C2 were used for network parameter fine tuning. The segmentation output of the different trained models was compared against expert ground truth by means of geometric metrics. Moreover, a trained physician graded the network segmentations as well as the segmentations propagated by the clinical\u00a0TPS.\nThe BMs showed dice similarity coefficients (DSC) of 0.88(4) and 0.93(3) for the rectum and the bladder, respectively, independent of the facility. CTV segmentation with the BM was the best for intermediate- and high-risk cancer patients from C1 with DSC=0.84(5) and worst for C2 with DSC=0.74(7). The PS transfer learning brought a significant improvement in the CTV segmentation, yielding DSC=0.72(4) for post-prostatectomy and low-risk patients and DSC=0.88(5) for intermediate- and high-risk patients. The FS training did not improve the segmentation accuracy considerably. The physician's assessment of the TPS-propagated versus network-generated structures showed a clear advantage of the\u00a0latter.\nThe obtained results showed that the presented segmentation technique has potential to improve automatic segmentation for MR-guided\u00a0RT.", "Lack of clinical validation and inter-observer variability are two limitations of endoscopic assessment and scoring of disease severity in patients with ulcerative colitis [UC]. We developed a deep learning [DL] model to improve, accelerate and automate UC detection, and predict the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore [MES] and the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity [UCEIS].\nA total of 134 prospective videos [1550 030 frames] were collected and those with poor quality were excluded. The frames were labelled by experts based on MES and UCEIS scores. The scored frames were used to create a preprocessing pipeline and train multiple convolutional neural networks [CNNs] with proprietary algorithms in order to filter, detect and assess all frames. These frames served as the input for the DL model, with the output being continuous scores for MES and UCEIS [and its components]. A graphical user interface was developed to support both labelling video sections and displaying the predicted disease severity assessment by the artificial intelligence from endoscopic recordings.\nMean absolute error [MAE] and mean bias were used to evaluate the distance of the continuous model's predictions from ground truth, and its possible tendency to over/under-predict were excellent for MES and UCEIS. The quadratic weighted kappa used to compare the inter-rater agreement between experts' labels and the model's predictions showed strong agreement [0.87, 0.88 at frame-level, 0.88, 0.90 at section-level and 0.90, 0.78 at video-level, for MES and UCEIS, respectively].\nWe present the first fully automated tool that improves the accuracy of the MES and UCEIS, reduces the time between video collection and review, and improves subsequent quality assurance and scoring.", "Employers place emphasis on graduates' work experience and interpersonal skills while academia mainly focuses on developing students' learning ability. One proposed strategy is through career guidance by universities; however, supportive evidence is lacking. This study explored the career readiness of pharmacy students for the Saudi job market. It also examined the availability of career guidance services for pharmacy students and alumni in Saudi Arabia and the impact of such services on recipients' career path choices and development of competencies.\nThis cross-sectional study utilized an online-based survey. Pharmacy students in the last three years of their program and recent graduates participated in the survey. The study used descriptive statistics to describe participants' demographic data. Respondents were asked to rate aspects related to career readiness on a 5-point Likert scale, and their responses were reported as frequencies with percentages or means as appropriate. Comparisons between groups were made using t-test or one- way ANOVA as required.\nA total of 576 responses were collected. About 25% of participants acknowledged the career guidance services provided at their pharmacy college, whereas the majority indicated that they have never reached out to a career counselor at their university (89.6%). The highest level of disagreement was noticed in impact of career guidance services on participants' establishment of their CV/portfolio (50.7%). Using the work readiness scale, the lowest mean was seen in the social intelligence domain (3.64 \u00b1 0.94).\nAlthough substantial proportion of students reported the presence of career guidance services in their university or college, very few stated that they had utilized such services. This could have impacted the students' career readiness for the rapidly changing Saudi job market. Therefore, proper measures to advertise the availability of career guidance services in Saudi pharmacy schools have to be implemented.", "Advances in artificial intelligence have produced a few predictive models in glaucoma, including a logistic regression model predicting glaucoma progression to surgery. However, uncertainty exists regarding how to integrate the wealth of information in free-text clinical notes. The purpose of this study was to predict glaucoma progression requiring surgery using deep learning (DL) approaches on data from electronic health records (EHRs), including features from structured clinical data and from natural language processing of clinical free-text notes.\nDevelopment of DL predictive model in an observational cohort.\nAdult patients with glaucoma at a single center treated from 2008 through\u00a02020.\nOphthalmology clinical notes of patients with glaucoma were identified from EHRs. Available structured data included patient demographic information, diagnosis codes, prior surgeries, and clinical information including intraocular pressure, visual acuity, and central corneal thickness. In addition, words from patients' first 120 days of notes were mapped to ophthalmology domain-specific neural word embeddings trained on PubMed ophthalmology abstracts. Word embeddings and structured clinical data were used as inputs to DL models to predict subsequent glaucoma surgery.\nEvaluation metrics included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and F1 score, the harmonic mean of positive predictive value, and sensitivity on a held-out test set.\nSeven hundred forty-eight of 4512 patients with glaucoma underwent surgery. The model that incorporated both structured clinical features as well as input features from clinical notes achieved an AUC of 73% and F1 of 40%, compared with only structured clinical features, (AUC, 66%; F1, 34%) and only clinical free-text features (AUC, 70%; F1, 42%). All models outperformed predictions from a glaucoma specialist's review of clinical notes (F1, 29.5%).\nWe can successfully predict which patients with glaucoma will need surgery using DL models on EHRs unstructured text. Models incorporating free-text data outperformed those using only structured inputs. Future predictive models using EHRs should make use of information from within clinical free-text notes to improve predictive performance. Additional research is needed to investigate optimal methods of incorporating imaging data into future predictive models as well.", "Despite its promising future, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated decision-making in healthcare services and medical research faces several legal and ethical hurdles. The European Union (EU) is tackling these issues with the existing legal framework and drafting new regulations, such as the proposed AI Act. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) partly regulates AI systems, with rules on processing personal data and protecting data subjects against solely automated decision-making. In healthcare services, (automated) decisions are made more frequently and rapidly. However, medical research focuses on innovation and efficacy, with less direct decisions on individuals. Therefore, the GDPR's restrictions on solely automated decision-making apply mainly to healthcare services, and the rights of patients and research participants may significantly differ. The proposed AI Act introduced a risk-based approach to AI systems based on the principles of ethical AI. We analysed the complex connection between the GDPR and AI Act, highlighting the main issues and finding ways to harmonise the principles of data protection and ethical AI. The proposed AI Act may complement the GDPR in healthcare services and medical research. Although several years may pass before the AI Act comes into force, many of its goals will be realised before that.", "Hexapeptides are widely applied as a model system for studying the amyloid-forming properties of polypeptides, including proteins. Recently, large experimental databases have become publicly available with amyloidogenic labels. Using these data sets for training and testing purposes, one may build artificial intelligence (AI)-based classifiers for predicting the amyloid state of peptides. In our previous work (Biomolecules 2021, 11, 500), we described the Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based Budapest Amyloid Predictor (https://pitgroup.org/bap). Here, we apply the Budapest Amyloid Predictor for discovering numerous amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic hexapeptide patterns with accuracy between 80% and 84%, as surprising and succinct novel rules for further understanding the amyloid state of peptides. For example, we have shown that for any independently mutated residue (position marked by \"x\"), the patterns CxFLWx, FxFLFx, or xxIVIV are predicted to be amyloidogenic, while those of PxDxxx, xxKxEx, and xxPQxx are nonamyloidogenic. We note that each amyloidogenic pattern with two x's (e.g.,CxFLWx) describes succinctly 202 = 400 hexapeptides, while the nonamyloidogenic patterns comprising four point mutations (e.g.,PxDxxx) give 204 = 160\u202f000 hexapeptides in total. We also examine the restricted substitutions for positions \"x\" from subclasses of proteinogenic amino acid residues; for example, if \"x\" is substituted with hydrophobic amino acids, then there exist patterns containing three x's, like MxVVxx, predicted to be amyloidogenic. If we can choose for the x positions any hydrophobic amino acids, except the \"structure breaker\" proline, then we get amyloid patterns with five x positions, for example, xxxFxx, each corresponding to 32\u202f768 hexapeptides. To our knowledge, no similar applications of artificial intelligence tools or succinct amyloid patterns were described before the present work.", "In the context of multicultural information, to explore and analyze the use effect of voice interactive educational robot in the classroom of adolescent students, and the physical and mental impact of movie characters on adolescent students, and to lay the foundation for studying the positive development of adolescents, under the guidance of positive psychology theory, the relationship between positive psychology and adolescent mental health is analyzed, the application of adolescent educational robot is discussed, and the relationship between adolescent educational robot combined with movies characters and positive development of adolescent is analyzed. The questionnaire is used to collect data, including the questionnaire on the influence of movie characters on the positive development of adolescents, the questionnaire of pre- and postpopularization of artificial intelligence in primary and secondary schools, and the satisfaction questionnaire of voice interactive educational robot. The reliability and validity of the questionnaire are analyzed. The results show that students who watch more than 20 movies are 20% in grade one and that is only 10% in grade three. 79% of the students think that the movie characters have an impact on themselves. The distribution of the number of the grade two students exposed to the movie is relatively uniform, 40% of them watch 10-20 movies, and 82% of them think that the movie characters have an impact on themselves; the Cronbach coefficient of classroom satisfaction questionnaire is 0.929\u2009>\u20090.9, the average value of the correlation of total correction items of the corresponding item is 0.612\u2009>\u20090.5, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measurement value is 0.812\u2009>\u20090.6, and the Sig value is 0.000\u2009<\u20090.05, indicating that the reliability and validity of the questionnaire are very high and 92.3% of the students are very satisfied with the classroom. This shows that voice interactive educational robot combined with movie characters can promote the positive development of adolescents.", "Panoramic radiographs can assist dentist to quickly evaluate patients' overall oral health status. The accurate detection and localization of tooth tissue on panoramic radiographs is the first step to identify pathology, and also plays a key role in an automatic diagnosis system. However, the evaluation of panoramic radiographs depends on the clinical experience and knowledge of dentist, while the interpretation of panoramic radiographs might lead misdiagnosis. Therefore, it is of great significance to use artificial intelligence to segment teeth on panoramic radiographs. In this study, SWin-Unet, the transformer-based Ushaped encoder-decoder architecture with skip-connections, is introduced to perform panoramic radiograph segmentation. To well evaluate the tooth segmentation performance of SWin-Unet, the PLAGH-BH dataset is introduced for the research purpose. The performance is evaluated by F1 score, mean intersection and Union (IoU) and Acc, Compared with U-Net, Link-Net and FPN baselines, SWin-Unet performs much better in PLAGH-BH tooth segmentation dataset. These results indicate that SWin-Unet is more feasible on panoramic radiograph segmentation, and is valuable for the potential clinical application.", "The maturity and commercialization of emerging digital technologies represented by artificial intelligence, cloud computing, block chain and virtual reality are giving birth to a new and higher economic form, that is, digital economy. Digital economy is different from the traditional industrial economy. It is clean, efficient, green and recyclable. It represents and promotes the future direction of global economic development, especially in the context of the sudden COVID-19 pandemic as a continuing disaster. Therefore, it is essential to establish the comprehensive evaluation model of digital economy development scientifically and reasonably. In this paper, first on the basis of literature analysis, the relevant indicators of digital economy development are collected manually and then screened by the grey dynamic clustering and rough set reduction theory. The evaluation index system of digital economy development is constructed from four dimensions: digital innovation impetus support, digital infrastructure construction support, national economic environment and digital policy guarantee, digital integration and application. Next the subjective weight and objective weight are calculated by the group FAHP method, entropy method and improved CRITIC method, and the combined weight is integrated with the thought of maximum variance. The grey correlation analysis and improved VIKOR model are combined to systematically evaluate the digital economy development level of 31 provinces and cities in China from 2013 to 2019. The results of empirical analysis show that the overall development of China's digital economy shows a trend of superposition and rise, and the development of digital economy in the four major economic zones is unbalanced. Finally, we put forward targeted opinions on the construction of China's provincial digital economy.", "To develop and validate an automated deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform for diagnosing and grading cataracts using slit-lamp and retroillumination lens photographs based on the Lens Opacities Classification System (LOCS) III.\nCross-sectional study in which a convolutional neural network was trained and tested using photographs of slit-lamp and retroillumination lens photographs.\nOne thousand three hundred thirty-five slit-lamp images and 637 retroillumination lens images from 596 patients.\nSlit-lamp and retroillumination lens photographs were graded by 2 trained graders using LOCS III. Image datasets were labeled and divided into training, validation, and test datasets. We trained and validated AI platforms with 4 key strategies in the AI domain: (1) region detection network for redundant information inside data, (2) data augmentation and transfer learning for the small dataset size problem, (3) generalized cross-entropy loss for dataset bias, and (4) class balanced loss for class imbalance problems. The performance of the AI platform was reinforced with an ensemble of 3 AI algorithms: ResNet18, WideResNet50-2, and ResNext50.\nDiagnostic and LOCS III-based grading prediction performance of AI platforms.\nThe AI platform showed robust diagnostic performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.9992 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9986-0.9998] and 0.9994 [95% CI, 0.9989-0.9998]; accuracy, 98.82% [95% CI, 97.7%-99.9%] and 98.51% [95% CI, 97.4%-99.6%]) and LOCS III-based grading prediction performance (AUC, 0.9567 [95% CI, 0.9501-0.9633] and 0.9650 [95% CI, 0.9509-0.9792]; accuracy, 91.22% [95% CI, 89.4%-93.0%] and 90.26% [95% CI, 88.6%-91.9%]) for nuclear opalescence (NO) and nuclear color (NC) using slit-lamp photographs, respectively. For cortical opacity (CO) and posterior subcapsular opacity (PSC), the system achieved high diagnostic performance (AUC, 0.9680 [95% CI, 0.9579-0.9781] and 0.9465 [95% CI, 0.9348-0.9582]; accuracy, 96.21% [95% CI, 94.4%-98.0%] and 92.17% [95% CI, 88.6%-95.8%]) and good LOCS III-based grading prediction performance (AUC, 0.9044 [95% CI, 0.8958-0.9129] and 0.9174 [95% CI, 0.9055-0.9295]; accuracy, 91.33% [95% CI, 89.7%-93.0%] and 87.89% [95% CI, 85.6%-90.2%]) using retroillumination images.\nOur DL-based AI platform successfully yielded accurate and precise detection and grading of NO and NC in 7-level classification and CO and PSC in 6-level classification, overcoming the limitations of medical databases such as few training data or biased label distribution.", "Low birth weight is the most important condition of neonatal community health and the main cause of neonates' mortality. Identifying the indexes associated with this condition, and factors to prevent, and managing related data can help reduce the birth of premature infants to reduce the mortality rate due to this condition. The goal of present study was to design, implement and evaluate an innovative intelligence information management system for premature infants.\nThe present study was a multidisciplinary research that was done in 2019 to 2021 in four integrated phases in Iran. The first phase aimed to compare the current status of registration systems of premature infants through a systematic review and semi-structured interviews by using the Delphi model Then the minimum data set was determined and was designed a proposed model based on it. In the second phase, the structure and how the user interacts with the system were determined, and, using Microsoft Visio software, Unified Modeling Language diagrams were drawn to define the logical relationship of data. In the third phase, the system was developed, and finally in the last phase, in three methods, users' views on the usability of the system were evaluated.\nThe findings of this study included 233 essential data elements that were placed in two main groups of essential data, and the system was approved by end users for 87.73% consent and 67.19% satisfaction for SUMI (Software Usability Measurement Inventory) and 7.97 of 9 in QUIS questionnaire.\nThis research's results can be beneficial and functional such as a complete sample for design and development of other systems concerned to health systems.", "Most individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) experience a degradation in their speech intelligibility. Research on the use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) to assess intelligibility is still sparse, especially when trying to replicate communication challenges in real-life conditions (ie, noisy backgrounds). Developing technologies to automatically measure intelligibility in noise can ultimately assist patients in self-managing their voice changes due to the disease.\nThe goal of this study was to pilot-test and validate the use of a customized web-based app to assess speech intelligibility in noise in individuals with dysarthria associated with PD.\nIn total, 20 individuals with dysarthria associated with PD and 20 healthy controls (HCs) recorded a set of sentences using their phones. The Google Cloud ASR API was used to automatically transcribe the speakers' sentences. An algorithm was created to embed speakers' sentences in +6-dB signal-to-noise multitalker babble. Results from ASR performance were compared to those from 30 listeners who orthographically transcribed the same set of sentences. Data were reduced into a single event, defined as a success if the artificial intelligence (AI) system transcribed a random speaker or sentence as well or better than the average of 3 randomly chosen human listeners. These data were further analyzed by logistic regression to assess whether AI success differed by speaker group (HCs or speakers with dysarthria) or was affected by sentence length. A discriminant analysis was conducted on the human listener data and AI transcriber data independently to compare the ability of each data set to discriminate between HCs and speakers with dysarthria.\nThe data analysis indicated a 0.8 probability (95% CI 0.65-0.91) that AI performance would be as good or better than the average human listener. AI transcriber success probability was not found to be dependent on speaker group. AI transcriber success was found to decrease with sentence length, losing an estimated 0.03 probability of transcribing as well as the average human listener for each word increase in sentence length. The AI transcriber data were found to offer the same discrimination of speakers into categories (HCs and speakers with dysarthria) as the human listener data.\nASR has the potential to assess intelligibility in noise in speakers with dysarthria associated with PD. Our results hold promise for the use of AI with this clinical population, although a full range of speech severity needs to be evaluated in future work, as well as the effect of different speaking tasks on ASR.", "Clinical teaching practice of nurse educators is important in the development of clinical competence of undergraduate nursing students, but it is often not done according to best practice standards. This study aimed to summarise the best clinical teaching practices of nurse educators teaching undergraduate nursing programmes. An integrative literature review was conducted according to Whittemore and Knafl's adapted stages. A systematic search of electronic databases, including EBSCOhost and ScienceDirect, for applicable papers from January 2001 to June 2021, was followed by a manual search. The review resulted in selection of 67 papers, and critical appraisal had been completed by two independent reviewers using relevant critical appraisal tools. Papers that were selected revealed six main themes, with sub-themes, outlining best practices for clinical teaching, namely: (1) planning for clinical teaching practice: self-preparation and planning for clinical placement; (2) facilitation of students' clinical learning: orientation of students, planning for clinical teaching and the clinical teaching process; (3) evaluation of students' clinical skills: reflection by the nursing student and feedback; (4) modelling professional clinical teaching practice: emotional intelligence, self-evaluation, role modelling and continuous professional development; (5) work-based assessment in the clinical environment: clinical assessment process and clinical assessment tools and (6) clinical teaching in the simulation laboratory. The six identified best practices could assist nurse educators to provide comprehensive clinical teaching.\nThe review's results can be used in the development of a best practice guideline for clinical teaching. This guideline will aid nurse educators in achieving best clinical teaching practices.", "The purpose of this review is to present the latest innovations and current topics in musculoskeletal diagnosis and interventional imaging, with a focus on degenerative and inflammatory diseases.\nIn this study, the search was conducted through the online databases PubMed and Google Scholar, including articles published in English in the past 15 years, in order to find existing studies, clinical cases, and reviews on the latest innovations and current topics in degenerative and inflammatory musculoskeletal pathologies.\nImaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of MSK degenerative and inflammatory disease. In the last few years continuous innovations and technological advances have allowed new clinical applications in the management of MSK disorder.

Artificial intelligence also increasingly seeks to be applied in all fields of medicine and radiology with increasingly promising results.\nImaging modalities undergo continuous innovations and revolutions due to technological advances, with direct repercussions on clinical applications and new therapeutic potential through interventional radiology techniques. In recent years, there have been particular innovations in the context of musculoskeletal imaging of degenerative and inflammatory diseases, both for diagnosis and intervention.", "With the development of The Times, social events are increasing, and emergency management has gradually become the main helper to solve the crisis in the public domain. By observing the current situation of many countries and regions, we can find that various types of public crises often occur in many countries and regions in the world, which have severely affected people's daily life, lives, and property. Through long-term research and analysis, it can be known that the emergency management mechanism currently established in China has certain shortcomings. The communication problem of emergency information is likely to cause the emergency work to not proceed smoothly. In addition, problems in the communication channels of emergency information are likely to cause problems in the cooperation of various departments when people carry out emergency management work, and the efficiency of the government in dealing with problems will also be reduced in real scenarios. In order to improve the efficiency of emergency information management, this paper aims at the various problems existing and facing in the construction of emergency management system. On this basis, the integration of various relevant emergency information management plan models is analyzed and sorted out, and based on the research and integration of the development of artificial intelligence algorithms. The main research results of emergency information management at home and abroad are comprehensively studied and evaluated. Finally, a QG algorithm based on more model fusion is developed. In the process of analysis, this article uses artificial intelligence algorithms to build a prediction model of multiple modes and collects the data needed to build the model by random extraction. Through the analysis of different data sets, it is used as the basic training data for prediction. Through comprehensive analysis, the model constructed in this paper can promote the sharing of emergency information among departments to a certain extent.", "In innovation strategy, a type of Schumpeterian competitive strategy in business administration, \"intra-individual diversity\" has attracted attention as one factor for creating innovation. In this study, we redefine \"framework for identifying researchers' areas of expertise\" as \"a framework for quantifying intra-individual diversity among researchers. Note that diversity here refers to authorship of articles in multiple research fields. The application of this framework then made it possible to visualize organizational diversity by accumulating the intra-individual diversity of researchers and to discuss the innovation strategy of the organization. The analysis in this study discusses how countries are promoting research on the topics of artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which are at the core of Industry 4.0, from an innovation perspective. Note that Industry 4.0 is a technological framework that aims to \"improve the efficiency of all social systems,\" \"create new industries,\" and \"increase intellectual productivity.\" For the analysis, we used 19-year bibliographic data (2000-2018) from the top 20 countries in terms of the number of papers in AI, big data, and IoT technologies. As the results, this study classified the styles of cross-disciplinary fusion into four patterns in AI and three patterns in big data. This study did not consider the results in IoT because of only small differences between countries. Furthermore, regional differences in the style of cross-disciplinary fusion were also observed, and the global innovation patterns in Industry 4.0 were classified into seven categories. In Europe and North America, the cross-disciplinary integration style was similar to that between the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, England, Italy, Canada, and France. In Asia, the cross-disciplinary fusion style was similar between China, Japan, and South Korea.", "A higher level of intelligence can improve adolescents' interactions with intelligent online services, although overemphasizing intelligent online services may nullify their sense of autonomy and in turn affect their acceptance intention. Enterprises have therefore focused on the best ways through which to provide intelligent online services. Based on the technology acceptance model, this study constructs a theoretical model of the impact of perceived control and power on adolescents' acceptance intention of intelligent services. Through a scenario experiment involving an intelligent online recommendation service, 195 participants were obtained to test the model. The results show that the adolescents' perceived control affects their acceptance intention of intelligent online services through their perceived usefulness. The adolescents' sense of power moderates the influence of perceived control on perceived usefulness. This study supplements the research on intelligent online services and provides a reference for online merchants seeking to design such service processes.", "Computational modeling is increasingly used to assist in the discovery of supramolecular materials. Supramolecular materials are typically primarily built from organic components that are self-assembled through noncovalent bonding and have potential applications, including in selective binding, sorption, molecular separations, catalysis, optoelectronics, sensing, and as molecular machines. In this review, the key areas where computational prediction can assist in the discovery of supramolecular materials, including in structure prediction, property prediction, and the prediction of how to synthesize a hypothetical material are discussed, before exploring the potential impact of artificial intelligence techniques on the field. Throughout, the importance of close integration with experimental materials discovery programs will be highlighted. A series of case studies from the author's work across some different supramolecular material classes will be discussed, before finishing with a discussion of the outlook for the field.", "Gastric atrophy is a precancerous lesion. We aimed to clarify whether gastric atrophy determined by artificial intelligence (AI) correlates with the diagnosis made by expert endoscopists using several endoscopic classifications, the Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) classification based on histological findings, and genotypes associated with gastric atrophy and cancer.\nTwo hundred seventy Helicobacter pylori-positive outpatients were enrolled. All patients' endoscopy data were retrospectively evaluated based on the Kimura-Takemoto, modified Kyoto, and OLGA classifications. The AI-trained neural network generated a continuous number between 0 and 1 for gastric atrophy. Nucleotide variance of some candidate genes was confirmed or selectively assessed for a variety of genotypes, including the COX-21195, IL-1\u03b2 511, and mPGES-1 genotypes.\nThere were significant correlations between determinations of gastric atrophy by AI and by expert endoscopists using not only the Kimura-Takemoto classification (P\u2009<\u20090.001), but also the modified Kyoto classification (P\u00a0=\u00a00.046 and P\u2009<\u20090.001 for the two criteria). Moreover, there was a significant correlation with the OLGA classification (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Nucleotide variance of the COX-2, IL-1\u03b2, and mPGES-1genes was not significantly associated with gastric atrophy determined by AI. The area under the curve values of the combinations of AI and the modified Kyoto classification (0.746) and AI and the OLGA classification (0.675) were higher than in AI alone (0.665).\nCombinations of AI and the modified Kyoto classification or of AI and the OLGA classification could be useful tools for evaluating gastric atrophy in patients with H. pylori infection as the risk of gastric cancer.", "The knee joint is the second largest joint in the human body, with a wide range of functional activities and strong support for the human body. Moreover, the cartilage of the knee joint is hyaline cartilage, which is relatively brittle, so it is most vulnerable to trauma. In clinical work, the damage of articular cartilage is a disease with a high rate of orthopedic visits. In this paper, all the experimental group cases included in the observation were patients with acute articular cartilage injury or OA diagnosed by knee arthroscopy. All experimental groups and control groups did not have any strenuous exercise one day before MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and they sat for 30\u2009minutes before the examination. Conventional scanning sagittal FSE-T1WI, FSE-T2WI, FS-FSE-T1WI, FS-FSE-T2WI, FS-PDWI, and coronal FS-PDWI sequence. In the normal control group, after the T2 color map was generated in the workstation, the articular cartilage was divided on the midsagittal plane, and the patellar cartilage and tibial plateau were roughly divided into upper, middle, lower and anterior, middle, and posterior thirds. In order to ensure the maximum comparability of the results, an artificial intelligence segmentation algorithm is used to divide the region of interest equally, and the central part of each partition is selected as much as possible for measurement. The T2 values of the three partitions of each cartilage were measured one by one and averaged. For the comparison results of T2 value of cartilage in the same part: according to patellar cartilage, femoral cartilage, and tibial cartilage, the P values are 0.973, 0.150, and 0.525, respectively. Therefore, early detection and early treatment of articular cartilage injury are of great significance to the performance of athletes' competition level and the extension of sports life.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved superhuman performance in board games such as Go, chess, and Othello (Reversi). In other words, the AI system surpasses the level of a strong human expert player in such games. In this context, it is difficult for a human player to enjoy playing the games with the AI. To keep human players entertained and immersed in a game, the AI is required to dynamically balance its skill with that of the human player. To address this issue, we propose AlphaDDA, an AlphaZero-based AI with dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA). AlphaDDA consists of a deep neural network (DNN) and a Monte Carlo tree search, as in AlphaZero. AlphaDDA learns and plays a game the same way as AlphaZero, but can change its skills. AlphaDDA estimates the value of the game state from only the board state using the DNN. AlphaDDA changes a parameter dominantly controlling its skills according to the estimated value. Consequently, AlphaDDA adjusts its skills according to a game state. AlphaDDA can adjust its skill using only the state of a game without any prior knowledge regarding an opponent. In this study, AlphaDDA plays Connect4, Othello, and 6x6 Othello with other AI agents. Other AI agents are AlphaZero, Monte Carlo tree search, the minimax algorithm, and a random player. This study shows that AlphaDDA can balance its skill with that of the other AI agents, except for a random player. AlphaDDA can weaken itself according to the estimated value. However, AlphaDDA beats the random player because AlphaDDA is stronger than a random player even if AlphaDDA weakens itself to the limit. The DDA ability of AlphaDDA is based on an accurate estimation of the value from the state of a game. We believe that the AlphaDDA approach for DDA can be used for any game AI system if the DNN can accurately estimate the value of the game state and we know a parameter controlling the skills of the AI system.", "With the popularity of wine culture and the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, wine label image retrieval becomes more and more important. Taking an wine label image as an input, the goal of this task is to return the wine information that the user hopes to know, such as the main brand and sub-brand of the wine. The main challenge in wine label image retrieval task is that there are a large number of wine brands with the imbalance of their sample images which strongly affects the training of the retrieval system based on deep learning. To solve this problem, this article adopts a distribted strategy and proposes two distributed retrieval frameworks. It is demonstrated by the experimental results on the large scale wine label dataset and the Oxford flowers dataset that both our proposed distributed retrieval frameworks are effective and even greatly outperform the previous state-of-the-art retrieval models.", "Averting nutrient volatilisation in thermal treatment of organic waste is a challenging task. The dynamics of ammonia volatilisation and the role of additives in preventing the losses of nutrients in thermal digestion of food waste (FW) were explored. The experimental trials were performed in a convective dehydrator at different combinations of temperatures and airflow velocities. The study dictated that ammonia volatilisation rate increased with increase in temperature and airflow velocity. The losses reached to its peak during the initial drying period and then gradually declined in the falling rate period. An artificial intelligence-based random forest model was explored to precisely predict the ammonia losses during the drying process. The SEM-EDX images confirmed enhanced N (2.25%) in the alum treated end product compared to blank (N - 1.8%) and thus reveals alum induced mineralization of nutrients. Higher intensities of the N containing compounds peaks observed in FTIR spectra also supported the mineralization of nitrogen. XRD analysis indicated formation of stable ammonium compounds in the sample digested with alum. Cost benefit analysis of the alum aided digestion revealed that it enhances the nutrient retention and overall cost of N in the end product by \u20b9626/tonne. The study revealed high potential of alum in reducing the ammonia volatilisation and enhancing the agronomical value of nutrients in the thermal digestion process.", "Light field imaging (LFI) based on Liquid crystal microlens array (LC MLAs) are emerging as a significant area for 3D imaging technology in the field of upcoming Internet of things and artificial intelligence era. However, in scenes of LFI through conventional MLAs, such as biological imaging and medicine imaging, the quality of imaging reconstruction will be severely reduced due to the limited depth of field. Here, we are proposed a low-voltage driving LC MLAs with electrically tunable depth of field (DOF) for the LFI system. An aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) film was deposited on the top of the hole-patterned driven-electrode arrays and used as a high resistance (Hi-R) layer, a uniform gradient electric field was obtained across the sandwiched LC cell. Experimental results confirm that the proposed LC MLAs possess high-quality interference rings and tunable focal length at a lower working voltage. In addition, the focal lengths are tunable from 3.93 to 2.62\u00a0mm and the DOF are adjustable from 15.60 to 1.23\u00a0mm. The experiments demonstrated that the LFI system based on the proposed structure can clearly capture 3D information of the insets with enlarged depths by changing the working voltage and driving frequency, which indicates that the tunable DOF LC MLAs have a potential application prospects for the biological and medical imaging.", "SLC6A4 is a serotonin re-uptake transporter which has been a target for anti-depressant therapies but recently some mutations have been described in cancer cells. Here, we characterize mutations in SLC6A4 that appear in cancer cells. We employed several validated computational and artificial intelligence algorithms to characterize the mutations. We identified a previously uncharacterized G100V mutation in lung cancers. In sillico structural analysis reveals that this mutation may affect SLC6A4 ligand binding and subsequently its function. We also identified several other mutations that may affect the structure of the protein. This preliminary analysis highlights the role of SLC6A4 in human cancers.", "Terahertz imaging and spectroscopy is an exciting technology that has the potential to provide insights in medical imaging. Prior research has leveraged statistical inference to classify tissue regions from terahertz images. To date, these approaches have shown that the segmentation problem is challenging for images of fresh tissue and for tumors that have invaded muscular regions. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning, has been shown to improve performance in some medical imaging challenges. This paper builds on that literature by modifying a set of deep learning approaches to the challenge of classifying tissue regions of images captured by terahertz imaging and spectroscopy of freshly excised murine xenograft tissue. Our approach is to preprocess the images through a wavelet synchronous-squeezed transformation (WSST) to convert time-sequential terahertz data of each THz pixel to a spectrogram. Spectrograms are used as input tensors to a deep convolution neural network for pixel-wise classification. Based on the classification result of each pixel, a cancer tissue segmentation map is achieved. In experimentation, we adopt leave-one-sample-out cross-validation strategy, and evaluate our chosen networks and results using multiple metrics such as accuracy, precision, intersection, and size. The results from this experimentation demonstrate improvement in classification accuracy compared to statistical methods, an improvement to segmentation between muscle and cancerous regions in xenograft tumors, and identify areas to improve the imaging and classification methodology.", "Determination and development of an effective set of models leveraging Artificial Intelligence techniques to generate a system able to support clinical practitioners working with COVID-19 patients. It involves a pipeline including classification, lung and lesion segmentation, as well as lesion quantification of axial lung CT studies.\nA deep neural network architecture based on DenseNet is introduced for the classification of weakly-labeled, variable-sized (and possibly sparse) axial lung CT scans. The models are trained and tested on aggregated, publicly available data sets with over 10 categories. To further assess the models, a data set was collected from multiple medical institutions in Colombia, which includes healthy, COVID-19 and patients with other diseases. It is composed of 1,322 CT studies from a diverse set of CT machines and institutions that make over 550,000 slices. Each CT study was labeled based on a clinical test, and no per-slice annotation took place. This enabled a classification into Normal vs. Abnormal patients, and for those that were considered abnormal, an extra classification step into Abnormal (other diseases) vs. COVID-19. Additionally, the pipeline features a methodology to segment and quantify lesions of COVID-19 patients on the complete CT study, enabling easier localization and progress tracking. Moreover, multiple ablation studies were performed to appropriately assess the elements composing the classification pipeline.\nThe best performing lung CT study classification models achieved 0.83 accuracy, 0.79 sensitivity, 0.87 specificity, 0.82 F1 score and 0.85 precision for the Normal vs. Abnormal task. For the Abnormal vs COVID-19 task, the model obtained 0.86 accuracy, 0.81 sensitivity, 0.91 specificity, 0.84 F1 score and 0.88 precision. The ablation studies showed that using the complete CT study in the pipeline resulted in greater classification performance, restating that relevant COVID-19 patterns cannot be ignored towards the top and bottom of the lung volume.\nThe lung CT classification architecture introduced has shown that it can handle weakly-labeled, variable-sized and possibly sparse axial lung studies, reducing the need for expert annotations at a per-slice level.\nThis work presents a working methodology that can guide the development of decision support systems for clinical reasoning in future interventionist or prospective studies.", "The aim of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to automatically and accurately determine the stage of cervical vertebra maturation (CVM) with the main purpose being to eliminate the human error factor.\nArchives of the cephalometric images were reviewed and the data of 1501 subjects with fully visible cervical vertebras were included in this retrospective study.\nLateral cephalometric (LC) that met the inclusion criteria were used in the training process, labeling was carried out using a computer vision annotation tool (CVAT), tracing was done by an experienced orthodontist as a gold standard and, in order to limit the effect of the uneven distribution of the training data set, maturation stage was classified with a modified Bachetti method by the operator who labelled them. The labelled data were split randomly into a training set (80%), a testing set (10%) and an validation set (10%), to measure intra-observer, inter-observer reliability, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and weighted Cohen's kappa test was carried out.\nThe ICC was valued at 0.973, weighted Cohen's kappa standard error was 0.870\u2009\u00b1\u20090.027 which shows high reliability of the observers and excellent level of agreement between them, the segmentation network achieved a global accuracy of 0.99 and the average dice score overall images was 0.93. The classification network achieved an accuracy of 0.802, class sensitivity of (pre-pubertal 0.78; pubertal 0.45; post-pubertal 0.98), respectively, per class specificity of (pre-pubertal 0.94; pubertal 0.94; post-pubertal 0.75), respectively.\nThe developed algorithm showed the ability to determine the cervical vertebrae maturation stage which might aid in a faster diagnosis process by eliminating human intervention, which might lead to wrong decision-making procedures that might affect the outcome of the treatment plan. The developed algorithm proved reliable in determining the pre-pubertal and post-pubertal growth stages with high accuracy.", "An adverse event is any abnormal clinical finding associated with the use of a therapy. Adverse events are classified by reporting an event's seriousness, expectedness, and relatedness. Monitoring patient safety is of utmost importance as more and more data becomes available. In reality, very low numbers of adverse events are reported via the official path. Chart review, voluntary reporting, computerized surveillance, and direct observation can detect adverse drug events. Medication errors are commonly seen in hospitals and need provider and system-based interventions to prevent them. The need of the hour in India is to develop and implement medication safety best practices to avoid adverse events. The utility of artificial intelligence techniques in adverse event detection remains unexplored, and their accuracy and precision need to be studied in a controlled setting. There is a need to develop predictive models to assess the likelihood of adverse reactions while testing novel pharmaceutical drugs.", "In this paper, in-depth research and analysis of juvenile delinquency prevention and occupational therapy education guidance using artificial intelligence are conducted, and its response mechanism is designed in this way. Two crime type prediction algorithms based on time-crime type count vectorization and dense neural network and crime type prediction based on the fusion of dense neural network and long- and short-term memory neural network are proposed. The outputs of both are fed into a new neural network for training to achieve the fusion of the two neural networks. Among them, the use of the dense neural network can effectively fit the relationship between the constructed features and crime types. The behavioral manifestations and causes of the formation of deviant behavior in adolescents are discussed. They can only read numerical data, but there is a lot of information in the textual data that is closely related to the training effect. When experimenting, it is necessary to extract knowledge and build applications. The practical work with adolescents with deviant behaviors is again carried out from group work and casework, respectively, with problem diagnosis, needs assessment, and service plan development for specific clients, to carry out relevant practical service work. The causes of juvenile delinquency in the Internet culture are discussed in terms of the Internet environment, juvenile use of the Internet, Internet supervision, and crime prevention education, respectively. The fourth chapter focuses on the analysis of the prevention and control measures for juvenile delinquency in cyberculture. In response to the above-mentioned causes of juvenile delinquency in cyberculture, the prevention and control measures are discussed in four aspects, namely, strengthening the construction of cyberculture and building a healthy cyber environment, strengthening the capacity building of guiding juveniles to use cyber correctly, building a prevention and supervision system to promote the improvement of the legal system, and improving and innovating the crime prevention education in the cyber era.", "Animals, including humans, differ in a wide range of physical and cognitive abilities ranging from measures of running speed and physical strength to learning ability and intelligence. We consider the evolution of ability when individuals interact pairwise over their contribution to a common good. In this interaction, the contribution of each is assumed to be the best given their own ability and the contribution of their partner. Since there is a tendency for individuals to partially compensate for a low contribution by their partner, low-ability individuals can do well. As a consequence, for benefit and cost structures for which individuals have a strong response to partner's contribution, there can be selection for reduced ability. Furthermore, there can be disruptive selection on ability, leading to a bimodal distribution of ability under some modes of inheritance.", "During the fourth age, a marked physiological deterioration and critical points of dysfunction are observed, during which cognitive performance exhibits a marked decline in certain skills (fluid intelligence) but good performance of others (crystallized intelligence). Experimental evidence describes important constraints on word production during old age, accompanied by a relative stabilization of speech comprehension. However, cognitive changes associated with advanced aging could also affect comprehension, particularly word recognition. The present study examines how the visual recognition of words is affected during the fourth age when tasks involving different cognitive loads are applied. Through linear regression models, performance was compared between two third-age groups and a fourth-age group on reaction time (RT) and accuracy in naming, priming and lexical decision experiments. The fourth-age group showed a significant RT increase in all experiments. In contrast, accuracy was good when the task involved a low cognitive demand (Experiments 1 and 2); however, when a decisional cognitive factor was included (Experiment 3), the fourth-age group performed significantly worse than the younger third-age group. We argue that the behavior observed among fourth-age individuals is consistent with an unbalanced cognitive configuration, in which the fluid intelligence deficit significantly reduces the speed necessary to recognize words, independent of the cognitive load associated with the test. In contrast, the maintenance in crystallized intelligence improves the accuracy of the process, strengthening linguistic functionality in the advanced stages of old age.", "Despite its introduction into the diagnostic nomenclature over four decades ago, there remain large knowledge gaps about disordered gambling. The primary aims of the present study were to document the long-term course, childhood precursors, and adult life outcomes associated with disordered gambling.\nParticipants enrolled in the population-representative Dunedin Study were prospectively followed from birth through age 45. Disordered gambling was assessed six times from age 18; composite measures of childhood social class, general intelligence, and low self-control were based on assessments obtained from birth through age 15; adult socioeconomic, financial, and legal outcomes were obtained through age 45. Lifetime disordered gambling was predicted from the three childhood precursors and the adult outcomes were predicted from lifetime disordered gambling.\nPast-year disordered gambling usually occurred at only a single time point and recurrence was relatively uncommon. Lower childhood social class, general intelligence, and self-control significantly predicted lifetime disordered gambling in adulthood. In turn, lifetime disordered gambling in adulthood significantly predicted occupational, educational, and financial problems in adulthood (ds = 0.23-0.41). These associations were markedly reduced and sometimes rendered nonsignificant after adjusting for childhood precursors (ds = 0.04-0.32).\nSocioeconomic, financial, and legal outcomes in adulthood are not merely consequences of disordered gambling, but also are predicted from childhood precursors. Deflecting the trajectories of young people at risk for developing disordered gambling may help to ameliorate not just the development of later disordered gambling, but also other associated adverse outcomes.", "Machine learning is the field of artificial intelligence in which computers are trained to make predictions or to identify patterns in data through complex mathematical algorithms. It has great potential in critical care to predict outcomes, such as acute kidney injury, and can be used for prognosis and to suggest management strategies. Machine learning can also be used as a research tool to advance our clinical and biochemical understanding of acute kidney injury. In this review, we introduce basic concepts in machine learning and review recent research in each of these domains.", "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant changes in the external environment of enterprises, resulting in tremendous negative impacts. Accordingly, the irregular fluctuation of business data poses a critical challenge to traditional approaches. Therefore, to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, an effective model is required to proactively predict an enterprise's performance and simultaneously generate scientific performance optimization solutions. Consequently, at the intersection of artificial intelligence algorithms, operations research, and management science, an intelligent DEA-SVM model, which has a theoretical contribution, is developed in this study. The capabilities of this model are verified through sufficient numerical experiments. On the one hand, this model outperforms traditional algorithms in prediction accuracy. On the other hand, effective performance optimization solutions for low-performance enterprises are obtained from the input-output perspective. Moreover, the application value of this model is reflected in its successful implementation in the healthcare industry. Thus, it is a user-friendly tool for realizing the stable operation of enterprises in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "With the emergence and development of artificial intelligence, design is no longer a process that can be completed only by creativity and knowledge. This article introduces research based on voice data mining and further discusses the optimization and application of rhetorical methods for e-commerce advertising. This article is working from two main aspects: one is to use association rule models in speech data mining to obtain useful rule relationships between Chinese prosody parameters, and the other is to use neural networks and data items in speech data mining. Using computer technology can make online advertisements interact with users. In addition to clicking on advertisements to jump to product pages, online advertisements also have multichannel sensory feelings, which can provide rich information and stimulate interest through interaction with users. We need to optimize the rhetoric of the advertisement and pay attention to the combination of the beauty of speech and the content of the advertisement when designing the advertisement. At the same time, we must also pay attention to the accuracy and elegance of the advertising language and wording.", "Early diagnosis and treatment of retinoblastoma are of paramount importance for a positive clinical outcome. The most common sign of retinoblastoma is leukocoria, or white pupil. Effective, easy-to-perform, community-based screening is needed to improve outcomes in lower-income regions. The EyeScreen (developed by Joshua Meyer from the University of Michigan) Android (Google LLC) smartphone application is an important step toward addressing this need. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential of the novel use of low-cost technologies-a cell phone application and machine learning-to identify leukocoria.\nA cell phone application was developed and refined with the feedback from on-site, single-population use in Ethiopia. Application performance was evaluated in this technology validation study.\nOne thousand four hundred fifty-seven participants were recruited from ophthalmology and pediatric clinics in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nPhotographs obtained with inexpensive Android smartphones running the EyeScreen Application were used to train an ImageNet (ResNet)\u00a0machine learning model and to measure the performance of the app. Eighty percent of the images were used in training the model, and 20% were reserved for testing.\nPerformance of the model was measured in terms of sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and precision-recall curve.\nAnalyses of the participant images resulted in the following at the participant level: sensitivity, 87%; specificity, 73%; area under the ROC curve, 0.93; and area under the precision-recall curve, 0.77.\nEyeScreen has the potential to serve as an effective screening tool in the areas of the world most affected by delayed retinoblastoma diagnosis. The relatively high initial performance of the machine learning model with small training datasets in this early-phase study can serve as a proof of concept for future use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in ophthalmic applications.", "Although long-term memory and Theory of Mind (ToM) are closely related across the whole lifespan, little is known about the relationship between ToM and semantic memory. Clinical studies have documented the co-occurrence of ToM impairments and semantic memory abnormalities in individuals with autism or semantic dementia. However, to date, no study has directly investigated the existence of a relationship between ToM and semantic memory in the typical population. We addressed this gap on a sample of 103 healthy adults (M age\u2009=\u200922.96\u2009years; age range\u2009=\u200919-35\u2009years). Participants completed a classical false memory task tapping on semantic processes, the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) task, and two ToM tasks, the Triangles and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes task. They also completed the vocabulary scale from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Results showed that participants' semantic performance in the DRM task was significantly related to that in the Triangles task. Specifically, the higher participants' ToM in the Triangles task, the higher participants' reliance on semantic memory while making false memories in the DRM task. Our findings are consistent with the Fuzzy Trace Theory and the Weak Central Coherence account and suggest that a (partially) common cognitive process responsible for global versus detailed-focus information processing could underlie these two abilities.", "Reliable Digit Span (RDS), RDS-Revised (RDS-R), and age-corrected scaled score (ACSS) have been previously validated as embedded performance validity tests (PVTs) from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV Digit Span subtest (WAIS-IV DS). However, few studies have directly compared the relative utility of these and other proposed WAIS-IV DS validity indicators within a single sample.\nThis study compared classification accuracies of 10 WAIS-IV DS indices in a mixed neuropsychiatric sample of 227 outpatients who completed a standardized neuropsychological battery. Participants with \u22641 PVT failures of the four, freestanding criterion PVTs constituted the valid group (n\u2009=\u2009181), whereas those with \u22652 PVT failures formed the invalid group (n\u2009=\u200946). Among the valid group, 113 met criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nClassification accuracies for all DS indicators were statistically significant across the overall sample and subsamples with and without MCI, apart from indices derived from the Forward trial in the MCI sample. DS Sequencing ACSS, working memory RDS (wmRDS), and DS ACSS emerged as the most effective predictors of validity status, with acceptable to excellent classification accuracy for the overall sample (AUCs\u2009=\u20090.792-0.816; 35%-50% sensitivity/88%-96% specificity).\nAlthough most DS indices demonstrated clinical utility as embedded PVTs, DS Sequencing ACSS, wmRDS, and DS ACSS may be particularly robust to cognitive impairment, minimizing risk of false positive errors while identifying noncredible performance. Moreover, DS indices incorporating data from multiple trials (i.e., wmRDS, DS ACSS) also generally yielded greater classification accuracy than those derived from a single trial.", "Infectious outbreaks are the foremost global public health concern, challenging the current healthcare system, which claims millions of lives annually. The most crucial way to control an infectious outbreak is by early detection through point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. POC diagnostics are highly advantageous owing to the prompt diagnosis, which is economical, simple and highly efficient with remote access capabilities. In particular, utilization of nanomaterials to architect POC devices has enabled highly integrated and portable (compact) devices with enhanced efficiency. As such, this review will detail the factors influencing the emergence of infectious diseases and methods for fast and accurate detection, thus elucidating the underlying factors of these infections. Furthermore, it comprehensively highlights the importance of different nanomaterials in POCs to detect nucleic acid, whole pathogens, proteins and antibody detection systems. Finally, we summarize findings reported on nanomaterials based on advanced POCs such as lab-on-chip, lab-on-disc-devices, point-of-action and hospital-on-chip. To this end, we discuss the challenges, potential solutions, prospects of integrating internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, 5G communications and data clouding to achieve intelligent POCs.", "Patients who undergo heart valve replacements with mechanical valves need to take Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) drugs (Warfarin, Nicoumalone) which has got a very narrow therapeutic range and needs very close monitoring using PT-INR. Accessibility to physicians to titrate drugs doses is a major problem in low-middle income countries (LMIC) like India. Our work was aimed at predicting the maintenance dosage of these drugs, using the de-identified medical data collected from patients attending an INR Clinic in South India. We used artificial intelligence (AI) - machine learning to develop the algorithm. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression model was built to predict the maintenance dosage of warfarin, who have stable INR values between 2.0 and 4.0. We developed a simple user friendly android mobile application for patients to use the algorithm to predict the doses. The algorithm generated drug doses in 1100 patients were compared to cardiologist prescribed doses and found to have an excellent correlation.", "The massive development of information technology based on big data, internet, and artificial intelligence has brought fundamental changes to human patterns and lifestyles, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic that hit globally, has added to a large and complex problems in parenting, as well as demanding people to take care of their children. Parents must be able to adapt and reposition themselves with new and effective forms of parenting, this can increase parental anxiety. To determine the level of parental anxiety, this research was conducted using a quantitative descriptive method through the distribution of questionnaires based on the GAD-7 instrument. This study focuses on efforts to capture the level of parental anxiety and the need for a new form of parenting. The results can be the basis for further research to find and develop new forms of parenting. The results of research on 669 parents living in West Java, Indonesia, showed that the level of parental anxiety was 63.08% at the level of moderate and severe anxiety. The level of parental satisfaction regarding the form of parenting used is at a low level of 67.12%, while the level of parental interest in the new form of parenting is at a very high level of 98.51%. The need for the latest form of parenting that can respond to the challenges and demands of the times is very necessary to minimize parental anxiety.", "Digital imaging systems (DISs) have been widely used in industrial process control, field monitoring, and other domains, and the autofocusing capability of DISs is a key factor affecting the imaging quality and intelligence of the system. In view of the deficiencies of focusing accuracy and speed in current imaging systems, this paper proposes a fast autofocus method of bionic vision on the basis of the liquid lens. First, the sharpness recognition network and sharpness comparison network are designed based on the consideration of a human visual focusing mechanism. Then a sharpness evaluation function combined with the distance-aware algorithm and an adaptive focusing search algorithm are proposed. These lead to the construction of our proposed autofocus method with the introduction of the memory mechanism. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, an experimental platform based on a liquid lens is built to test its performance. Experiment confirms that the proposed autofocus method has obvious advantages in robustness, accuracy, and speed compared with traditional methods.", "Assessing working posture risks is important for occupational safety and health. However, low-cost assessment techniques for human motion injuries in the logistics delivery industry have rarely been reported.\nTo propose a novel approach for posture risk assessment using low-cost motion capture with artificial intelligence.\nA Kinect was adopted to obtain red-green-blue (RGB) and depth images of the subject with 24 postures, and the human joints were extracted using artificial intelligence. The images were registered to obtain the actual three-dimensional (3D) human joint angle.\nThe root mean square error (RMSE) significantly decreased. Finally, two common methods for evaluating human working posture injuries-the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment and Ovako Working Posture Analysis System-were investigated.\nThe outputs of the proposed method are consistent with those of the commercial ergonomic evaluation software.", "Allergic diseases are increasing around the world with unprecedented complexity and severity. One of the reasons is that genetically modified crops produce new potentially allergenic proteins. From this starting point, many researchers have paid attention to the development of tools to predict the allergenicity of new proteins. In this study, a novel approach is introduced for the prediction of food allergens based on Artificial Intelligence techniques: a pairwise sequence alignment with the FASTA program for feature extraction and the use of the Deep Learning technique known as Restricted Boltzmann Machines in combination with the Decision Tree method for the prediction process. The developed tool, called ALLERDET (publicly available at http://allerdet.frangam.com), overcomes the state-of-the-art methods. The performance of our method is: 98.46% sensitivity, 94.37% specificity and 97.26% accuracy), on a data set built from several publicly available sources.", "Due to the difficult evaluation of the risk of anastomotic leakage (AL) after rectal cancer resection, the decision to perform a temporary ileostomy is not easily distinguishable. The aim of the present study was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model for identifying the risk of AL to assist surgeons in the selective implementation of a temporary ileostomy.\nThe data from 2240 patients with rectal cancer who received anterior resection were collected, and these patients were divided into one training and two test cohorts. Five AI algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and random forest (RF) were employed to develop predictive models using clinical variables and were assessed using the two test cohorts.\nThe SVM model indicated good discernment of AL, and might have increased the implementation of temporary ileostomy in patients with AL in the training cohort (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Following the assessment of the two test cohorts, the SVM model could identify AL in a favorable manner, which performed with positive predictive values of 0.150 (0.091-0.234) and 0.151 (0.091-0.237), and negative predictive values of 0.977 (0.958-0.988) and 0.986 (0.969-0.994), respectively. It is important to note that the implementation of temporary ileostomy in patients without AL would have been significantly reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and which would have been significantly increased in patients with AL (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\nThe model (https://alrisk.21cloudbox.com/) indicated good discernment of AL, which may be used to assist the surgeon's decision-making of performing temporary ileostomy.", "Since the twenty-first century, with the continuous improvement of economic life, people have higher and higher requirements for life at present. Therefore, exploring better environmental art design has become a key concern of many people. This kind of environmental design can rely on the development of modern art in China. By analyzing the atmosphere of environmental factors and visual construction methods in modern art works, it can be integrated into the geographic positioning and map construction of slam in artificial intelligence. After analyzing the flavor of the times and visual construction of modern art, it is believed that SLAM algorithm can be combined with full convolution network FCN and superpixel CRF and can better estimate the position in many dynamic scenes. Therefore, we should explore in different ways, integrate the art culture in modern art works with modern social science and technology, and realize the modernization of environmental art design. It can be seen that the slam system formed by combining with the visual construction of environmental factors in modern art works is more suitable for people's life at the current stage.", "Cancer is one of the top causes of death globally. Recently, microarray gene expression data has been used to aid in cancer's effective and early detection. The use of DNA microarray technology to uncover information from the expression levels of thousands of genes has enormous promise. The DNA microarray technique can determine the levels of thousands of genes simultaneously in a single experiment. The analysis of gene expression is critical in many disciplines of biological study to obtain the necessary information. This study analyses all the research studies focused on optimizing gene selection for cancer detection using artificial intelligence. One of the most challenging issues is figuring out how to extract meaningful information from massive databases. Deep Learning architectures have performed efficiently in numerous sectors and are used to diagnose many other chronic diseases and to assist physicians in making medical decisions. In this study, we have evaluated the results of different optimizers on a RNA sequence dataset. The Deep learning algorithm proposed in the study classifies five different forms of cancer, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and Colon Adenocarcinoma (COAD). The performance of different optimizers like Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Root Mean Squared Propagation (RMSProp), Adaptive Gradient Optimizer (AdaGrad), and Adaptive Momentum (AdaM). The experimental results gathered on the dataset affirm that AdaGrad and Adam. Also, the performance analysis has been done using different learning rates and decay rates.

However, due to the limitations in hardware, scan time, and throughput, it is often clinically challenging to obtain high-quality MR images. In this article, we propose a method of using artificial intelligence to expand the coils to achieve the goal of generating the virtual coils. The main characteristic of our work is utilizing dummy variable technology to expand/extrapolate the receive coils in both image and k-space domains. The high-dimensional information formed by coil expansion is used as the prior information to improve the reconstruction performance of parallel imaging. Two main components are incorporated into the network design, namely variable augmentation technology and sum of squares (SOS) objective function. Variable augmentation provides the network with more high-dimensional prior information, which is helpful for the network to extract the deep feature information of the data. The SOS objective function is employed to solve the deficiency of k-space data training while speeding up convergence. Experimental results demonstrated its great potentials in accelerating parallel imaging reconstruction.", "Transformers have achieved great success in many artificial intelligence fields, such as computer vision (CV), audio processing and natural language processing (NLP). In speech emotion recognition (SER), transformer-based architectures usually compute attention in a token-by-token (frame-by-frame) manner, but this approach lacks adequate capacity to capture local emotion information and is easily affected by noise. This paper proposes a novel SER architecture, referred to as block and token self-attention (BAT), that splits a mixed spectrogram into blocks and computes self-attention by combining these blocks with tokens, which can alleviate the effect of local noise while capturing authentic sentiment expressions. Furthermore, we present a cross-block attention mechanism to facilitate information interaction among blocks while integrating a frequency compression and channel enhancement (FCCE) module to smooth the attention biases between blocks and tokens. BAT achieves 73.2% weighted accuracy (WA) and 75.2% unweighted accuracy (UA) on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) dataset, surpassing the results of previously developed state-of-the-art approaches with the same dataset partitioning operation. Further experimental results reveal that our proposed method is also well suited for cross-database and cross-domain tasks, achieving 89% WA and 87.4% UA on Emo-DB and producing a top-1 recognition accuracy of 88.32% with only 15.01 Mb of parameters on the CIFAR-10 image dataset under a scenario with no data augmentation or pretraining.", "The incorporation of novel technologies such as artificial intelligence, data mining, and advanced statistical methodologies have received wide responses from researchers. This study was designed to model the factors impacting the actual milk yield of Holstein-Friesian cows using the proportional odds ordered logit model (OLM). A total of 8300 lactation records were collected for cows calved between 2005 and 2019. The actual milk yield, the outcome variable, was categorized into three levels: low (<\u20094500\u00a0kg), medium (4500-7500\u00a0kg), and high (>\u20097500\u00a0kg). The studied predictor variables were age at first calving (AFC), lactation order (LO), days open (DO), lactation period (LP), peak milk yield (PMY), and dry period (DP). The proportionality assumption of odds using the logit link function was verified for the current datasets. The goodness-of-fit measures revealed the suitability of the ordered logit models to datasets structure. Results showed that cows with younger ages at first calving produce two times higher milk quantities. Also, longer days open were associated with higher milk yield. The highest amount of milk yield was denoted by higher lactation periods (>\u2009250\u00a0days). The peak yield per kg was significantly related to the actual yield (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, shorter dry periods showed about 1.5 times higher milk yield. The greatest yield was observed in the 2nd and 4th parities, with an odds ratio (OR) equal to 1.75, on average. In conclusion, OLM can be used for analyzing dairy cows' data, denoting fruitful information as compared to the other classical regression models. In addition, the current study showed the possibility and applicability of OLM in understanding and analyzing livestock datasets suited for planning effective breeding programs.", "To our knowledge, no feasible, valid and reliable instrument exists to examine tactical skills over the course of multiple training and game situations in tennis yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of the Tactical Skills Questionnaire in Tennis (TSQT). The TSQT is a new instrument with closed-ended questions designed to examine tactical skills in tennis players. Participants were 233 competitive tennis players (age: 17.06 \u00b1 4.74 years) competing on national or regional levels. With a principal component analysis (PCA) we identified four theoretically meaningful subscales for the 31-item TSQT: \"Anticipation and positioning,\" \"Game intelligence and adaptability,\" \"Decision-making,\" and \"Recognizing game situations\" and confirmed them with a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (\u03c72 = 527.02, df = 426, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.045, SRMR = 0.079). Internal consistency was good, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.89 for the entire scale and McDonald's omega ranging from 0.69 to 0.78 for the separate subscales. A subsample of 57 players completed the TSQT twice to assess test-retest reliability. Absolute test-retest reliability of the subscales was good with no significant differences in mean scores between test and retest (p > 0.05). Relative test-retest reliability was moderate with ICC values ranging from 0.65 to 0.71. National players outperformed regional players on the subscales \"Game intelligence and adaptability,\" \"Decision-making,\" and \"Recognizing game situations\" (p < 0.05), and there was a trend toward significance for \"Anticipation and positioning\" (p = 0.07). This study supported the psychometric properties of the TSQT. Evaluating tactical skills with the TSQT provides players, coaches and other professionals with insight in players' self-assessed tactical skills over the course of multiple training and game situations. It creates the opportunity for players to reflect on their skills and detect personal development areas with their coach. We advise to use this information as input for tailor-made training programs.", "The advancement of artificial intelligence in education (AIED) has the potential to transform the educational landscape and influence the role of all involved stakeholders. In recent years, the applications of AIED have been gradually adopted to progress our understanding of students' learning and enhance learning performance and experience. However, the adoption of AIED has led to increasing ethical risks and concerns regarding several aspects such as personal data and learner autonomy. Despite the recent announcement of guidelines for ethical and trustworthy AIED, the debate revolves around the key principles underpinning ethical AIED. This paper aims to explore whether there is a global consensus on ethical AIED by mapping and analyzing international organizations' current policies and guidelines. In this paper, we first introduce the opportunities offered by AI in education and potential ethical issues. Then, thematic analysis was conducted to conceptualize and establish a set of ethical principles by examining and synthesizing relevant ethical policies and guidelines for AIED. We discuss each principle and associated implications for relevant educational stakeholders, including students, teachers, technology developers, policymakers, and institutional decision-makers. The proposed set of ethical principles is expected to serve as a framework to inform and guide educational stakeholders in the development and deployment of ethical and trustworthy AIED as well as catalyze future development of related impact studies in the field.", "The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies in recent years has resulted in improved company performance. Customer churn forecast is a difficult problem in many corporate sectors, particularly the telecommunications industry. Because customer churns have a direct impact on a company's total revenue, telecommunications firms have begun to develop 76 models to reduce churns at an earlier stage. Previous research has revealed that AI and ML models are effective CCP solutions. According to this viewpoint, this study proposes a unique AI-based CCP model for Telecommunication Business Markets (AICCP-TBM). The AICCP-TBM model's purpose is to control the existence of churners and non-churners in the telecom sector. The proposed AICCP-TBM model employs a Chaotic Salp Swarm Optimization-based Feature Selection (CSSO-FS) method for the best feature assortment. In addition, a Fuzzy Rule-based Classifier(FRC) is used to distinguish between client churners and non-churners. A technique known as Quantum Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) is used to pick the membership functions for the FRC model in order to improve the classification performance of the FRC model. The performance of the AICCP-TBM model is validated using a benchmark CCP dataset and the experimental results are reviewed from several angles. In relations of presentation, the imitation consequences demonstrated that the AICCP-TBM model surpassed the most recent state-of-the-art CPP models. The suggested AICCP-TBM method's comparative accuracy was thoroughly tested on the three datasets used. Using datasets 1-3, this technique obtained better levels of accuracy, with the maximum attainable values being 97.25 %, 97.5 % and 94.33 %. The simulation results for the AICCP-TBM model demonstrated improved prediction performance.", "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in nephrology and its associated clinical research is growing. Recent years have seen increased interest in utilizing AI to predict the development of hospital-based acute kidney injury (AKI). Several AI techniques have been employed to improve the ability to detect AKI across a variety of hospitalized settings. This review discusses the evolutions of AKI risk prediction discussing the static risk assessment models of yesteryear as well as the more recent trend toward AI and advanced learning techniques. We discuss the relative improvement in AKI detection as well as the relative dearth of data around the clinical implementation and patient outcomes using these models. The use of AI for AKI detection and clinical care is in its infancy, and this review describes how we arrived at our current position and hints at the promise of the future.", "Conventional microscopy is the standard procedure for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis, despite its limited sensitivity, reliance on skilled personnel, and the fact that it is error prone. Here, we report the performance of the innovative (semi-)automated Schistoscope 5.0 for optical digital detection and quantification of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in urine, using conventional microscopy as the reference standard. At baseline, 487 participants in a rural setting in Nigeria were assessed, of which 166 (34.1%) tested S. haematobium positive by conventional microscopy. Captured images from the Schistoscope 5.0 were analyzed manually (semiautomation) and by an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm (full automation). Semi- and fully automated digital microscopy showed comparable sensitivities of 80.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 73.2-86.0) and 87.3% (95% CI: 81.3-92.0), but a significant difference in specificity of 95.3% (95% CI: 92.4-97.4) and 48.9% (95% CI: 43.3-55.0), respectively. Overall, estimated egg counts of semi- and fully automated digital microscopy correlated significantly with the egg counts of conventional microscopy (r = 0.90 and r = 0.80, respectively, P < 0.001), although the fully automated procedure generally underestimated the higher egg counts. In 38 egg positive cases, an additional urine sample was examined 10 days after praziquantel treatment, showing a similar cure rate and egg reduction rate when comparing conventional microscopy with semiautomated digital microscopy. In this first extensive field evaluation, we found the semiautomated Schistoscope 5.0 to be a promising tool for the detection and monitoring of S. haematobium infection, although further improvement of the AI algorithm for full automation is required.", "Over the past 15 years, there have been significant advances in the treatment of acute and chronic medical consequences of stroke in childhood. Given high rates of survival in pediatric stroke, practitioners are tasked with treating the ongoing motor and neuropsychological sequelae in patients over the course of their development. This article provides a review of the current literature on neuropsychological outcomes in pediatric stroke, including intelligence, academics, language, visual-spatial skills, attention, executive functions, memory, and psychosocial function. Recent developments in functional neuroimaging are discussed, with a particular focus on language outcomes. We further review the current research on cognitive and behavioral rehabilitation and introduce intervention models in pediatric stroke. In the final section, we discuss future directions for clinical practice and research in pediatric stroke.", "Surveillance of postoperative vestibular schwannomas currently relies on manual segmentation and measurement of the tumor by content experts, which is both labor intensive and time consuming. We aimed to develop and validate deep learning models for automatic segmentation of postoperative vestibular schwannomas on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (GdT1WI) and noncontrast high-resolution T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (HRT2WI).\nA supervised machine learning approach using a U-Net model was applied to segment magnetic resonance imaging images into pixels representing vestibular schwannoma and background pixels.\nTertiary care hospital.\nOur retrospective data set consisted of 122 GdT1WI and 122 HRT2WI studies in 82 postoperative adult patients with a vestibular schwannoma treated with subtotal surgical resection between September 1, 2007, and April 17, 2018. Forty-nine percent of our cohort was female, the mean age at the time of surgery was 49.8 years, and the median time from surgery to follow-up scan was 2.26 years.\nN/A.\nTumor areas were manually segmented in axial images and used as ground truth for training and evaluation of the model. We measured the Dice score of the predicted segmentation results in comparison to manual segmentations from experts to assess the model's accuracy.\nThe GdT1WI model achieved a Dice score of 0.89, and the HRT2WI model achieved a Dice score of 0.85.\nWe demonstrated that postoperative vestibular schwannomas can be accurately segmented on GdT1WI and HRT2WI without human intervention using deep learning. This artificial intelligence technology has the potential to improve the postoperative surveillance and management of patients with vestibular schwannomas.", "This project aimed to explore the cultural competence of third-year undergraduate nursing students. A retrospective, quantitative, quasi-experimental design was used to collect data from 15 undergraduate students who took part in a three-week travel abroad community clinical to Thailand during 2019. Students engaged in reflective journaling. Data were collected before and after travel using the 20-item Cultural Intelligence Scale. Post mean scores were higher than presurveys, indicating that students improved on cultural competency overall. All subcategories showed a positive difference, and the results were overall statistically significant.", "Artificial intelligence has been prevalent recently as its use in the medical field is noticed to be increased. However, middle east countries like Syria are deficient in multiple AI implementation methods in the field of medicine. So, holding these AI implementation methods in the medical field is necessary, which may be incredibly beneficial for making diagnosis more accessible and help in the treatment. This paper intends to determine AI's knowledge, attitude, and practice among doctors and medical students in Syria. A questionnaire conducted an online cross-sectional study on the google form website consisting of demographic data, knowledge, and perception of AI. There were 1,494 responses from both doctors and medical students. We included Syrian medical students and doctors who are currently residing in Syria. Of the 1,494 participants, 255 (16.9%) are doctors, while the other 1,252 (83.1%) are undergraduate medical students. About 1,055 (70%) participants have previous knowledge about AI. However, only 357 (23.7%) participants know about its application in the medical field. Most have shown positive attitudes toward its necessity in the medical field; 689 (45.7%) individuals strongly agree, and 628 (41.7%) agree. The undergraduate students had 3.327 times more adequate knowledge of AI than students in the first year. In contrast, the undergraduate 6th-year students had 2.868 times the attitude toward AI higher than students in the first year. The residents and assistant professors had 2.371 and 4.422 times the practice of AI higher than students, respectively. Although most physicians and medical students do not sufficiently understand AI and its significance in the medical field, they have favorable views regarding using AI in the medical field. Syrian medical authorities and international organizations should suggest including artificial intelligence in the medical field, particularly when training residents and fellowship physicians.", "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and registers the highest number of deaths for women. Advances in diagnostic activities combined with large-scale screening policies have significantly lowered the mortality rates for breast cancer patients. However, the manual inspection of tissue slides by pathologists is cumbersome, time-consuming and is subject to significant inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently, the advent of whole-slide scanning systems has empowered the rapid digitization of pathology slides and enabled the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted digital workflows. However, AI techniques, especially Deep Learning, require a large amount of high-quality annotated data to learn from. Constructing such task-specific datasets poses several challenges, such as data-acquisition level constraints, time-consuming and expensive annotations and anonymization of patient information. In this paper, we introduce the BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS) dataset, a large cohort of annotated Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E)-stained images to advance AI development in the automatic characterization of breast lesions. BRACS contains 547 Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) and 4539 Regions Of Interest (ROIs) extracted from the WSIs. Each WSI and respective ROIs are annotated by the consensus of three board-certified pathologists into different lesion categories. Specifically, BRACS includes three lesion types, i.e., benign, malignant and atypical, which are further subtyped into seven categories. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest annotated dataset for breast cancer subtyping both at WSI and ROI levels. Furthermore, by including the understudied atypical lesions, BRACS offers a unique opportunity for leveraging AI to better understand their characteristics. We encourage AI practitioners to develop and evaluate novel algorithms on the BRACS dataset to further breast cancer diagnosis and patient care.

However, the desirable strain-insensitive conductivity and low hysteresis are restricted by the failure of stretchable structures and mismatch of mechanical properties (rigid conductive layer and elastic core substrate) under large deformation. Here, based on the principles of fractal geometry, a stretchable conductive fiber with hierarchical wrinkles inspired by the unique shape of the maple leaf was fabricated by combining surface modification, interfacial polymerization, and improved prestrain finishing methods to break through this dilemma. The shape and size of wrinkles predicted by buckling analysis via the finite element method fit well with that of actual wrinkles (30-80 \u03bcm of macro wrinkles and 4-6 \u03bcm of micro wrinkles) on the fabricated fiber. Such hierarchically wrinkled conductive fiber (HWCF) exhibited not only excellent strain-insensitive conductivity denoted by the relative resistance change \u0394R/R0 = 0.66 with R0 the original resistance and \u0394R the change of resistance after the concrete strain reaching up to 600%, but also low hysteresis (0.04) calculated by the difference in area between stretching and releasing curve of the \u0394R/R0 strain under 300% strain and long-term durability (>1000 stretching-releasing cycles). Furthermore, the elastic conductive fiber with such a bionic structure design can be applied as highly stretchable electrical circuits for illumination and monitors for the human motion under large strains through tiny and rapid resistance changes as well. Such a smart biomimetic material holds great prospects in the field of stretchable electronics.", "Longitudinal studies on musical development can provide very valuable insights and potentially evidence for causal mechanisms driving the development of musical skills and cognitive resources, such as working memory and intelligence. Nonetheless, quantitative longitudinal studies on musical and cognitive development are very rare in the published literature. Hence, the aim of this paper is to document available longitudinal evidence on musical development from three different sources. In part I, data from a systematic literature review are presented in a graphical format, making developmental trends from five previous longitudinal studies comparable. Part II presents a model of musical development derived from music-related variables that are part of the British Millennium Cohort Study. In part III, data from the ongoing LongGold project are analyzed answering five questions on the change of musical skills and cognitive resources across adolescence and on the role that musical training and activities might play in these developmental processes. Results provide evidence for substantial near transfer effects (from musical training to musical skills) and weaker evidence for far-transfer to cognitive variables. But results also show evidence of cognitive profiles of high intelligence and working memory capacity that are conducive to strong subsequent growth rates of musical development.", "In the last few years, electron microscopy has experienced a new methodological paradigm aimed to fix the bottlenecks and overcome the challenges of its analytical workflow. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are answering this call providing powerful resources towards automation, exploration, and development. In this review, we evaluate the state-of-the-art of machine learning applied to electron microscopy (and obliquely, to materials and nano-sciences). We start from the traditional imaging techniques to reach the newest higher-dimensionality ones, also covering the recent advances in spectroscopy and tomography. Additionally, the present review provides a practical guide for microscopists, and in general for material scientists, but not necessarily advanced machine learning practitioners, to straightforwardly apply the offered set of tools to their own research. To conclude, we explore the state-of-the-art of other disciplines with a broader experience in applying artificial intelligence methods to their research (e.g., high-energy physics, astronomy, Earth sciences, and even robotics, videogames, or marketing and finances), in order to narrow down the incoming future of electron microscopy, its challenges and outlook.", "Copy-number variations (CNVs) are an essential component of genetic variation distributed across large parts of the human genome. CNV detection from next-generation sequencing data and artificial intelligence algorithms have progressed in recent years. However, only a few tools have taken advantage of machine-learning algorithms for CNV detection, and none propose using artificial intelligence to automatically detect probable CNV-positive samples. The most developed approach is to use a reference or normal dataset to compare with the samples of interest, and it is well known that selecting appropriate normal samples represents a challenging task that dramatically influences the precision of results in all CNV-detecting tools. With careful consideration of these issues, we propose here ifCNV, a new software based on isolation forests that creates its own reference, available in R and python with customizable parameters. ifCNV combines artificial intelligence using two isolation forests and a comprehensive scoring method to faithfully detect CNVs among various samples. It was validated using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets from diverse origins (capture and amplicon, germline and somatic), and it exhibits high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. ifCNV is a publicly available open-source software (https://github.com/SimCab-CHU/ifCNV) that allows the detection of CNVs in many clinical situations.", "Extended reality technologies (e.g. virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR)) are gaining popularity in sports owing to their unique advantages. This study aims to analyse the progress of the application of extended reality technology in sports and reveal its cooperative features, research hotspots and development trends.\nWe searched the literature in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database within the period 2000 to 2021 and conducted a bibliometric analysis. The analysis methods included statistical, co-occurrence, hierarchical clustering and social network analyses.\nA total of 340 articles were gathered. The literature related to its research showed an increasing trend over time. The paper collaboration rate was 90.88% (309/340 papers), and the degree of author collaboration was 3.96 (1345/340). VR was found to be the most productive journal, and Queen's University Belfast was the most productive institution. The United States, China and the United Kingdom were the three main contributors to the field. The foundational themes in sports extended reality research were (i) sports games and extended reality systems, (ii) virtual simulation devices and artificial intelligence, (iii) sports training and performance and (iv) age-appropriate physical activity, sports rehabilitation and physical education.\nThe level of author collaboration was low, but the degree of author collaboration is largely on the rise. The closeness of the collaboration between institutions and countries was also low. In addition, the subject of sport extended reality is relatively fragmented. Therefore, more research is needed to strengthen it in the future.", "Developing robust artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical image analysis requires large quantities of diverse, well-chosen data that can prove challenging to collect because of privacy concerns, disease rarity, or diagnostic label quality. Collecting image-based datasets for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a potentially blinding disease, suffers from these challenges. Progressively growing generative adversarial networks (PGANs) may help, because they can synthesize highly realistic images that may increase both the size and diversity of medical datasets.\nDiagnostic validation study of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for plus disease detection, a component of severe ROP, using synthetic data.\nFive thousand eight hundred forty-two retinal fundus images (RFIs) collected from 963 preterm infants.\nRetinal vessel maps (RVMs) were segmented from RFIs. PGANs were trained to synthesize RVMs with normal, pre-plus, or plus disease vasculature. Convolutional neural networks were trained, using real or synthetic RVMs, to detect plus disease from 2 real RVM test datasets.\nFeatures of real and synthetic RVMs were evaluated using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). Similarities were evaluated at the dataset and feature level using Fr\u00e9chet inception distance and Euclidean distance, respectively. CNN performance was assessed via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC); AUCs were compared via bootstrapping and Delong's test for correlated receiver operating characteristic curves. Confusion matrices were compared using McNemar's chi-square test and Cohen's \u03ba value.\nThe CNN trained on synthetic RVMs showed a significantly higher AUC (0.971; P = 0.006 and P\u00a0= 0.004) and classified plus disease more similarly to a set of 8 international experts (\u03ba\u00a0= 0.922) than the CNN trained on real RVMs (AUC\u00a0= 0.934; \u03ba\u00a0= 0.701). Real and synthetic RVMs overlapped, by plus disease diagnosis, on the UMAP manifold, showing that synthetic images spanned the disease severity spectrum. Fr\u00e9chet inception distance and Euclidean distances suggested that real and synthetic RVMs were more dissimilar to one another than real RVMs were to one another, further suggesting that synthetic RVMs were distinct from the training data with respect to privacy considerations.\nSynthetic datasets may be useful for training robust medical AI models. Furthermore, PGANs may be able to synthesize realistic data for use without protected health information concerns.", "The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the older population has increased in recent years. A considerable number of studies have been performed to characterize these diseases. Imaging analysis is an important biomarker for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease. Objective and reliable assessment and precise detection are important for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) using brain MRI applied to the study of neurodegenerative diseases could promote early diagnosis and optimal decisions for treatment plans. MRI-based AI software have been developed and studied worldwide. Representatively, there are MRI-based volumetry and segmentation software. In this review, we present the development process of brain volumetry analysis software in neurodegenerative diseases, currently used and developed AI software for neurodegenerative disease in the Republic of Korea, probable uses of AI in the future, and AI software limitations.\n\ud604\ub300\uc0ac\ud68c\uac00 \uc810\ucc28 \uace0\ub839\ud654 \uc0ac\ud68c\uac00 \ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud1f4\ud589\uc131 \ub1cc\uc9c8\ud658\uc758 \ubc1c\ubcd1\ub960\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud1f4\ud589\uc131 \ub1cc\uc9c8\ud658\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud1f4\ud589\uc131 \ub1cc\uc9c8\ud658\uc758 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uc0c1\ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc601\uc0c1\ud45c\uc9c0\uc790\ub85c\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc601\uc0c1\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1d\uad00\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc77c\uad00\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ud3c9\uac00\ub294 \ud1f4\ud589\uc131 \ub1cc\uc9c8\ud658\uc758 \uc870\uae30 \uc9c4\ub2e8 \ubc0f \uc815\ud655\ud55c \uc9c4\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud1f4\ud589\uc131 \ub1cc\uc9c8\ud658\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud55c \uc601\uc0c1\uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc790\uae30\uacf5\uba85\uc601\uc0c1(\uc774\ud558 MRI)\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc774 \uc870\uae30 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uacfc \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uce58\ub8cc \ubc29\ud5a5 \uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub420 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 MRI \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub1cc\uc6a9\uc801 \uce21\uc815\uacfc \ubd84\ud68d\ud654 \ubc0f \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ud3ec\ucc29\ud558\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\ub4e4\uc774 \uac1c\ubc1c\ub418\uace0 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uae30 \uc2dc\uc791\ud588\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uace0\ucc30\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1f4\ud589\uc131 \ub1cc\uc9c8\ud658\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc0c1\ud669\uacfc \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \ud1f4\ud589\uc131 \ub1cc\uc9c8\ud658 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "Fetal ultrasound is an important component of antenatal care, but shortage of adequately trained healthcare workers has limited its adoption in low-to-middle-income countries. This study investigated the use of artificial intelligence for fetal ultrasound in under-resourced settings.\nBlind sweep ultrasounds, consisting of six freehand ultrasound sweeps, were collected by sonographers in the USA and Zambia, and novice operators in Zambia. We developed artificial intelligence (AI) models that used blind sweeps to predict gestational age (GA) and fetal malpresentation. AI GA estimates and standard fetal biometry estimates were compared to a previously established ground truth, and evaluated for difference in absolute error. Fetal malpresentation (non-cephalic vs cephalic) was compared to sonographer assessment. On-device AI model run-times were benchmarked on Android mobile phones.\nHere we show that GA estimation accuracy of the AI model is non-inferior to standard fetal biometry estimates (error difference -1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5 days, 95% CI -1.8, -0.9, n\u2009=\u2009406). Non-inferiority is maintained when blind sweeps are acquired by novice operators performing only two of six sweep motion types. Fetal malpresentation AUC-ROC is 0.977 (95% CI, 0.949, 1.00, n\u2009=\u2009613), sonographers and novices have similar AUC-ROC. Software run-times on mobile phones for both diagnostic models are less than 3\u2009s after completion of a sweep.\nThe gestational age model is non-inferior to the clinical standard and the fetal malpresentation model has high AUC-ROCs across operators and devices. Our AI models are able to run on-device, without internet connectivity, and provide feedback scores to assist in upleveling the capabilities of lightly trained ultrasound operators in low resource settings.", "Rapid antigen tests in the form of lateral flow devices (LFDs) allow testing of a large population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To reduce the variability in device interpretation, we show the design and testing of an artifical intelligence (AI) algorithm based on machine learning. The machine learning (ML) algorithm is trained on a combination of artificially hybridized LFDs and LFD data linked to quantitative real-time PCR results. Participants are recruited from assisted test sites (ATSs) and health care workers undertaking self-testing, and images are analyzed using the ML algorithm. A panel of trained clinicians is used to resolve discrepancies. In total, 115,316 images are returned. In the ATS substudy, sensitivity increased from 92.08% to 97.6% and specificity from 99.85% to 99.99%. In the self-read substudy, sensitivity increased from 16.00% to 100% and specificity from 99.15% to 99.40%. An ML-based classifier of LFD results outperforms human reads in assisted testing sites and self-reading.", "In the United Kingdom (UK), whilst nurse educators are responsible for developing compassion through providing high quality education, there is limited literature exploring how their lived experience of compassion is interpreted in nurse education.\nTo explore how nurse educators make meaning of compassion through their lived experiences in the UK.\nHermeneutic phenomenology.\nA UK school of nursing.\nPurposeful sampling was used to recruit twelve nurse educators.\nSemi-structured interviews were used to explore participant experiences of compassion. Data analysis involved crafting stories and was interpreted by applying Heideggerian and Gadamerian philosophical notions to surface meanings of everyday experiences.\nThe phenomenological themes identified nurse educators interpreted compassion through Being-with is Care; settling their colliding worlds of nursing practice and nurse education, and balancing Kairos or 'felt' time with negotiated time for compassion in nurse education.\nThis research demonstrates that nurse educators share genuine concern for Being-with others that is interpreted as compassion. However, the emotional aspect of compassion is avoided in their professional practice as a means of protecting students and their own feelings of vulnerability. There are colliding views in understanding compassion. Emotional intelligence is identified as necessary to grasp 'felt' moments or negotiate a time to Be-with that is interpreted as compassion. Training and support is necessary for nurse educators to understand and develop compassion in their professional practices.", "Breast cancer was the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and early mammography screening could decrease the breast cancer mortality. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnose system based on machine learning (ML) methods can help improve the screening accuracy and efficacy. This study aimed to systematically review and make a meta-analysis on the diagnostic accuracy of mammography diagnosis of breast cancer through various ML methods. Springer Link, Science Direct (Elsevier), IEEE Xplore, PubMed and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies published from January 2000 to September 2021. The study was registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (protocol no. CRD42021284227). A Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) was used to assess the included studies, and reporting was evaluated using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The pooled summary estimates for sensitivity, specificity, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for three ML methods (convolutional neural network [CNN], artificial\u00a0neural\u00a0network [ANN], support\u00a0vector\u00a0machine [SVM]) were calculated. A total of 32 studies with 23,804 images were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled estimate for sensitivity, specificity and AUC was 0.914 [95% CI 0.868-0.945], 0.916 [95% CI 0.873-0.945] and 0.945 for mammography diagnosis of breast cancer through three ML methods. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC of CNN were 0.961 [95% CI 0.886-0.988], 0.950 [95% CI 0.924-0.967] and 0.974. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC of ANN were 0.837 [95% CI 0.772-0.886], 0.894 [95% CI 0.764-0.957] and 0.881. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC of SVM were 0.889 [95% CI 0.807-0.939], 0.843 [95% CI 0.724-0.916] and 0.913. Machine learning methods (especially CNN) show excellent performance in mammography diagnosis of breast cancer screening based on retrospective studies. More rigorous prospective studies are needed to evaluate the longitudinal performance of AI.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) can unveil novel personalized treatments based on drug screening and whole-exome sequencing experiments (WES). However, the concept of \"black box\" in AI limits the potential of this approach to be translated into the clinical practice. In contrast, explainable AI (XAI) focuses on making AI results understandable to humans. Here, we present a novel XAI method -called multi-dimensional module optimization (MOM)- that associates drug screening with genetic events, while guaranteeing that predictions are interpretable and robust. We applied MOM to an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cohort of 319 ex-vivo tumor samples with 122 screened drugs and WES. MOM returned a therapeutic strategy based on the FLT3, CBF\u03b2-MYH11, and NRAS status, which predicted AML patient response to Quizartinib, Trametinib, Selumetinib, and Crizotinib. We successfully validated the results in three different large-scale screening experiments. We believe that XAI will help healthcare providers and drug regulators better understand AI medical decisions.", "We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model that can predict five-year survival in patients with stage IV metastatic breast cancer, mainly based on host factors and sarcopenia. From a prospectively built breast cancer registry, a total of 210 metastatic breast cancer patients were selected in a consecutive manner using inclusion/exclusion criteria. The patients' data were divided into two categories: a group that survived for more than 5 years and a group that did not survive for 5 years. For the AI model input, 11 features were considered, including age, body mass index, skeletal muscle area (SMA), height-relative SMA (H-SMI), height square-relative SMA (H2-SMA), weight-relative SMA (W-SMA), muscle mass, anticancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and comorbid diseases such as hypertension and mellitus. For the feature importance analysis, we compared classifiers using six different machine learning algorithms and found that extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) provided the best accuracy. Subsequently, we performed the feature importance analysis based on XGBoost and proposed a 4-layer deep neural network, which considered the top 10 ranked features. Our proposed 4-layer deep neural network provided high sensitivity (75.00%), specificity (78.94%), accuracy (78.57%), balanced accuracy (76.97%), and an area under receiver operating characteristics of 0.90. We generated a web application for anyone to easily access and use this AI model to predict five-year survival. We expect this web application to be helpful for patients to understand the importance of host factors and sarcopenia and achieve survival gain.", "The incidence of multiple primary lung cancer (MPLC) in China is 0.52%-2.45%. Most primary lung cancer cases have reported two lesions or three in rare cases. We report a rare case of bilateral simultaneous multiple primary lung adenocarcinoma of four different genotypes.\nA 58-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on June 29, 2021, and upon physical examination, four multiple pulmonary nodules were identified in both lungs. Further computed tomography (CT) images revealed the presence of ground glass nodules, predicted to be high-risk cancer lesions by artificial intelligence. With the guidance of three-dimensional reconstruction of preoperative CT images, the nodules were resected under thoracoscopy. Postoperative pathological investigation revealed that the nodule types were adenocarcinoma in situ, invasive alveolar adenocarcinoma, and microinvasive adenocarcinoma. The excised nodules were further sequenced using high-throughput sequencing (semiconductor sequencing method) of 26 lung cancer genes to confirm that the four lesions were not homologous. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 8, that is, on July 15, 2021. One month later, she returned to the hospital for follow-up and reexamination. Chest CT examination showed that she had recovered well, and no obvious exudation and effusion were found in both pleural cavities. Evaluation of postoperative pulmonary function showed that her forced vital capacity was 1.40 L (preoperative value, 2.27 L) and forced expiratory volume was 1.24 L (preoperative value, 2.23 L).\nThe surgical plan for multiple pulmonary nodules should be carefully considered. For carefully selected patients with concurrently occurring multiple lung nodules in both lungs, sublobectomy is a safe and feasible plan for concurrent bilateral resection of the lesions. Genetic sequencing is necessary for MPLC diagnosis and treatment.", "To examine the reliability and validity of the public transportation use assessment form (PTAF), which was developed for assessing the performance of tasks during public transportation use.\nFifty consecutive patients admitted after a stroke to a convalescent rehabilitation hospital and received field-based practice for public transportation use were enrolled. A physical therapist (PT) and an occupational therapist (OT) independently evaluated actual participant performance using the PTAF. Its internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and construct validity were examined against other clinical measures related to the ability to use public transportation.\nCronbach's coefficient alpha for the internal consistency for overall PTAF was 0.84 and 0.88 for PTs and OTs, respectively. Cohen's weighted \u03ba coefficient for the inter-rater reliability for each item ranged from 0.61 to 0.83. Intraclass correlation coefficients for the inter-rater reliability for the mean scores of the items comprising the PTAF were 0.90 for all 14 items, 0.76 for items required for train use only, and 0.88 for items required for bus use only. The correlation coefficients for the construct validity between PTAF and clinical measures ranged from 0.38 to 0.59 (p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nThe PTAF showed sufficient internal consistency, intra-rater reliability, and construct validity.Implications for rehabilitationThis study illustrated the inter-rater reliability of the public transportation use assessment form (PTAF), indicating that the PTAF can be used for reliable assessment independent of the rater.The PTAF showed good internal consistency, indicating that each item in the PTAF consistently assessed the ability of patients with stroke to use public transportation.The PTAF correlated with assessment tools such as walking ability, balance, motor paralysis, intelligence, and activities of daily living, indicating that it reflects the functions and abilities necessary to use public transportation.", "The National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) reduces diabetes incidence and associated medical costs but is typically staffing-intensive, limiting scalability. We evaluated an alternative delivery method with 3933 members of a program powered by conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) called Lark DPP that has full recognition from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nWe compared weight loss maintenance at 12 months between two groups: 1) CDC qualifiers who completed \u22654 educational lessons over 9 months (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009191) and 2) non-qualifiers who did not complete the required CDC lessons but provided weigh-ins at 12 months (n\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009223). For a secondary aim, we removed the requirement for a 12-month weight and used logistic regression to investigate predictors of weight nadir in 3148 members.\nCDC qualifiers maintained greater weight loss at 12 months than non-qualifiers (M\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20095.3%, SE\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009.8 vs. M\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u20093.3%, SE\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009.8; p\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009.015), with 40% achieving \u22655%. The weight nadir of 3148 members was 4.2% (SE\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009.1), with 35% achieving \u22655%. Male sex (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.11; P\u2009\u2009=\u2009\u2009.009), weeks with \u22652 weigh-ins (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.68; P\u2009<\u2009.0001), and days with an AI-powered coaching exchange (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.43; P\u2009<\u2009.0001) were associated with a greater likelihood of achieving \u22655% weight loss.\nAn AI-powered DPP facilitated weight loss and maintenance commensurate with outcomes of other digital and in-person programs not powered by AI. Beyond CDC lesson completion, engaging with AI coaching and frequent weighing increased the likelihood of achieving \u22655% weight loss. An AI-powered program is an effective method to deliver the DPP in a scalable, resource-efficient manner to keep pace with the prediabetes epidemic.", "Many studies have explored emotional and mental services that robots can provide for older adults, such as offering them daily conversation, news, music, or health information. However, the ethical issues raised by using sensors for frail older adults to monitor their daily movements or their medication intake, for instance, are still being discussed. In this study, we develop an older adult-guided, caregiver-monitored robot, Dori, which can detect and recognize movement by sensing human poses in accordance with two factors from the human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) framework. To design the care robot's services based on sensing movement during daily activities, we conducted focus group interviews with two groups-caregivers and medical staff-on the topic of care robot services not for patients but for prefrail and frail elderly individuals living at home. Based on their responses, we derived the focal service areas of cognitive support, emotional support, physical activity support, medication management, and caregiver management. We also found the two groups differed in their ethical judgments in the areas of dignity, autonomy, controllability, and privacy for services utilizing sensing by care robots. Therefore, the pose recognition technology adopted in the present work uses only joint coordinate information extracted from camera images and thus is advantageous for protecting human dignity and personal information.", "This study exploratively conducted two investigations of timbre influenced by harmonic loudness. Investigation 1 examined piano timbre preference between non-processed melodies and two kinds of adjustments created via an equalizer-a basic tool used for sound engineering and for producing audio materials. Using the paired comparison method, 98 respondents were surveyed. The results show that in the bass range of the piano sound, the preferred audio material was that produced via an equalizer by reducing the loudness of the 7th and 9th harmonics by 15 dB, while enhancing the loudness of the 8th harmonic by 15 dB. Investigation 2 examined three degrees of the processed melodies-adjusting the harmonics by 15, 10, and 5 dB. The results show that the 15 dB change was the best, while the 10 dB change was the worst. These results provide a new approach to improving the sound timbre for sound engineering and artificial intelligence music production.", "Modern life quality is strongly supported by the advances made in biosensors, which has been attributed to their crucial and viable contribution in point-of-care (POC) technology developments. POC devices are exploited for the fast tracing of disease progression, rapid analysis of water, and food quality assessment. Blood glucose meters, home pregnancy strips, and COVID-19 rapid tests all represent common examples of successful biosensors. Biosensors can provide great specificity due to the incorporation of selective bio-recognition elements and portability at significantly reduced costs. Electrochemical biosensor platforms are one of the most advantageous of these platforms because they offer many merits, such as being cheap, selective, specific, rapid, and portable. Furthermore, they can be incorporated into smartphones and various analytical approaches in order to increase their sensitivity and many other properties. As a very broad and interdisciplinary area of research and development, biosensors include all disciplines and backgrounds from materials science, chemistry, physics, medicine, microbiology/biology, and engineering. Accordingly, in this state-of-the-art article, historical background alongside the long journey of biosensing construction and development, starting from the Clark oxygen electrode until reaching highly advanced wearable stretchable biosensing devices, are discussed. Consequently, selected examples among the miscellaneous applications of nanobiosensors (such as microbial detection, cancer diagnosis, toxicity analysis, food quality-control assurance, point of care, and health prognosis) are described. Eventually, future perspectives for intelligent biosensor commercialization and exploitation in real-life that is going to be supported by machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are stated.", "Swarm Intelligence (SI) is one of the research fields that has continuously attracted researcher attention in these last two decades. The flexibility and a well-known decentralized collective behavior of its algorithm make SI a suitable candidate to be implemented in the swarm robotics domain for real-world optimization problems such as target search tasks. Since the introduction of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a representation of the SI algorithm, it has been widely accepted and utilized especially in local and global search strategies. Because of its simplicity, effectiveness, and low computational cost, PSO has retained popularity notably in the swarm robotics domain, and many improvements have been proposed. Target search problems are one of the areas that have been continuously solved by PSO. This article set out to analyze and give the inside view of the existing literature on PSO strategies towards target search problems. Based on the procedure of PRISMA Statement review method, a systematic review identified 51 related research studies. After further analysis of these total 51 selected articles and consideration on the PSO components, target search components, and research field components, resulting in nine main elements related to the discussed topic. The elements are PSO variant, application field, PSO inertial weight function, PSO efficiency improvement, PSO termination criteria, target available, target mobility status, experiment framework, and environment complexity. Several recommendations, opinions, and perfectives on the discussed topic are presented. Finally, recommendations for future research in this domain are represented to support future developments.", "The rate of obesity in adolescents has increased due to social distancing measures and school closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These issues have caused adolescents to change their lifestyles and eating habits. Furthermore, the growth in inactive behavior and computer screen or watching TV time, as well as the reduction in physical activity, could similarly be related with obesity. To overcome this problem, we recently developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based gesture recognition game application called Super Kids Adventure (SUKIA, Funrehab, Daejeon, Korea), which provides inexpensive and motivational game applications. This research is designed to assess the effects of SUKIA and Nintendo Switch (NINS) on calorie consumption, VO2 max, 6-minute walking test (6MWT) as well as body mass index (BMI), and the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale (RPE) in adolescents with obesity. A convenience sample of 24 adolescents with obesity were randomized into either the NINS or SUKIA groups 5 days/week for 3 weeks. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent t-tests were presented with significant level at p < 0.05, and the analysis indicated that SUKIA showed superior effects on calorie consumption, VO2 max, and RPE compared to NINS. Our results provide evidence that SUKIA can more effectively improve cardiopulmonary function and calorie consumption than NINS in adolescents with obesity during COVID-19.", "Personalised healthcare has seen significant improvements due to the introduction of health monitoring technologies that allow wearable devices to unintrusively monitor physiological parameters such as heart health, blood pressure, sleep patterns, and blood glucose levels, among others. Additionally, utilising advanced sensing technologies based on flexible and innovative biocompatible materials in wearable devices allows high accuracy and precision measurement of biological signals. Furthermore, applying real-time Machine Learning algorithms to highly accurate physiological parameters allows precise identification of unusual patterns in the data to provide health event predictions and warnings for timely intervention. However, in the predominantly adopted architectures, health event predictions based on Machine Learning are typically obtained by leveraging Cloud infrastructures characterised by shortcomings such as delayed response times and privacy issues. Fortunately, recent works highlight that a new paradigm based on Edge Computing technologies and on-device Artificial Intelligence significantly improve the latency and privacy issues. Applying this new paradigm to personalised healthcare architectures can significantly improve their efficiency and efficacy. Therefore, this paper reviews existing IoT healthcare architectures that utilise wearable devices and subsequently presents a scalable and modular system architecture to leverage emerging technologies to solve identified shortcomings. The defined architecture includes ultrathin, skin-compatible, flexible, high precision piezoelectric sensors, low-cost communication technologies, on-device intelligence, Edge Intelligence, and Edge Computing technologies. To provide development guidelines and define a consistent reference architecture for improved scalable wearable IoT-based critical healthcare architectures, this manuscript outlines the essential functional and non-functional requirements based on deductions from existing architectures and emerging technology trends. The presented system architecture can be applied to many scenarios, including ambient assisted living, where continuous surveillance and issuance of timely warnings can afford independence to the elderly and chronically ill. We conclude that the distribution and modularity of architecture layers, local AI-based elaboration, and data packaging consistency are the more essential functional requirements for critical healthcare application use cases. We also identify fast response time, utility, comfort, and low cost as the essential non-functional requirements for the defined system architecture.", "Endoscopists' abilities to diagnose early gastric cancers (EGCs) vary, especially between specialists and nonspecialists. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic support tool \"Tango\" to differentiate EGCs and compared its performance with that of endoscopists.\nThe diagnostic performances of Tango and endoscopists (34 specialists, 42 nonspecialists) were compared using still images of 150 neoplastic and 165 non-neoplastic lesions. Neoplastic lesions included EGCs and adenomas. The primary outcome was to show the noninferiority of Tango (based on sensitivity) over specialists. The secondary outcomes were the noninferiority of Tango (based on accuracy) over specialists and the superiority of Tango (based on sensitivity and accuracy) over nonspecialists. The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between Tango and the specialists for sensitivity was calculated, with >-10% defined as noninferiority and >0% defined as superiority in the primary outcome. The comparable differences between Tango and the endoscopists for each performance were calculated, with >10% defined as superiority and >0% defined as noninferiority in the secondary outcomes.\nTango achieved superiority over the specialists based on sensitivity (84.7% vs. 65.8%, difference 18.9%, 95% CI 12.3-25.3%) and demonstrated noninferiority based on accuracy (70.8% vs. 67.4%). Tango achieved superiority over the nonspecialists based on sensitivity (84.7% vs. 51.0%) and accuracy (70.8% vs. 58.4%).\nThe AI-based diagnostic support tool for EGCs demonstrated a robust performance and may be useful to reduce misdiagnosis.", "The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is sometimes difficult for nonspecialists, resulting in misdiagnosis. A missed diagnosis can lead to improper management and poor outcomes. Moreover, nonspecialists lack a simple diagnostic model with high accuracy for AD diagnosis.\nRandomly assigned data, including training data, of 6000 patients and test data of 1932 from 7932 patients who visited our memory clinic between 2009 and 2021 were introduced into the artificial intelligence (AI)-based AD diagnostic model, which we had developed.\nThe AI-based AD diagnostic model used age, sex, Hasegawa's Dementia Scale-Revised, the Mini-Mental State Examination, the educational level, and the voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) score. It had a sensitivity, specificity, and c-static value of 0.954, 0.453, and 0.819, respectively. The other AI-based model that did not use the VSRAD had a sensitivity, specificity, and c-static value of 0.940, 0.504, and 0.817, respectively.\nWe created an AD diagnostic model with high sensitivity for AD diagnosis using only data acquired in daily clinical practice. By using these AI-based models, nonspecialists could reduce missed diagnoses and contribute to the appropriate use of medical resources.", "Some artificial intelligence models applied in medical practice require ongoing retraining, introduce unintended racial bias, or have variable performance among different subgroups of patients. We assessed the real-world performance of the artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram to detect left ventricular systolic dysfunction with respect to multiple patient and electrocardiogram variables to determine the algorithm's long-term efficacy and potential bias in the absence of retraining.\nElectrocardiograms acquired in 2019 at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida with an echocardiogram performed within 14 days were analyzed (n = 44 986 unique patients). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate performance of the algorithm among age groups, racial and ethnic groups, patient encounter location, electrocardiogram features, and over time. The artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram to detect left ventricular systolic dysfunction had an AUC of 0.903 for the total cohort. Time series analysis of the model validated its temporal stability. Areas under the curve were similar for all racial and ethnic groups (0.90-0.92) with minimal performance difference between sexes. Patients with a 'normal sinus rhythm' electrocardiogram (n = 37 047) exhibited an AUC of 0.91. All other electrocardiogram features had areas under the curve between 0.79 and 0.91, with the lowest performance occurring in the left bundle branch block group (0.79).\nThe artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram to detect left ventricular systolic dysfunction is stable over time in the absence of retraining and robust with respect to multiple variables including time, patient race, and electrocardiogram features.", "To construct and validate a deep learning cluster from whole slide images (WSI) for depicting the immunophenotypes and functional heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in patients with bladder cancer (BLCA) and to explore an artificial intelligence (AI) score to explore the underlying biological pathways in the developed WSI cluster.\nIn this study, the WSI cluster was constructed based on a deep learning procedure. Further rerecognition of TME features in pathological images was applied based on a neural network. Then, we integrated the TCGA cohort and several external testing cohorts to explore and validate this novel WSI cluster and a corresponding quantitative indicator, the AI score. Finally, correlations between the AI cluster (AI score) and classical BLCA molecular subtypes, immunophenotypes, functional heterogeneity, and potential therapeutic method in BLCA were assessed.\nThe WSI cluster was identified associated with clinical survival (P < 0.001) and was proved as an independent predictor (P = 0.031), which could also predict the immunology and the clinical significance of BLCA. Rerecognition of pathological images established a robust 3-year survival prediction model (with an average classification accuracy of 86%, AUC of 0.95) for BLCA patients combining TME features and clinical features. In addition, an AI score was constructed to quantify the underlying logic of the WSI cluster (AUC = 0.838). Finally, we hypothesized that high AI score shapes an immune-hot TME in BLCA. Thus, treatment options including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), chemotherapy, and ERBB therapy can be used for the treatment of BLCA patients in WSI cluster1 (high AI score subtype).\nIn general, we showed that deep learning can predict prognosis and may aid in the precision medicine for BLCA directly from H&E histology, which is more economical and efficient.", "To assess 3-dimensional surface shape patterns of the optic nerve head (ONH) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in glaucoma with unsupervised artificial intelligence (AI).\nRetrospective study.\nPatients with OCT scans obtained between 2016 and 2020 from Massachusetts Eye and Ear.\nThe first reliable Cirrus (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc) ONH OCT scans from each eye were selected. The ONH and RNFL surface shape was represented by the vertical positions of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) relative to the lowest ILM vertical position in each eye. Nonnegative matrix factorization was applied to determine the ONH and RNFL surface shape patterns, which then were correlated with OCT and visual field (VF) loss parameters and subsequent VF loss rate. We tested whether using ONH and RNFL surface shape patterns improved the prediction accuracy for associated VF loss and subsequent VF loss rates measured by adjusted r 2 and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) difference compared with using established OCT parameters alone.\nOptic nerve head and RNFL surface shape patterns and prediction of the associated VF loss and subsequent VF loss rates.\nWe determined 14 ONH and RNFL surface shape patterns using 9854 OCT scans from 5912 participants. Worse mean deviation (MD) was most correlated (r = 0.29 and r = 0.24, Pearson correlation; each P < 0.001) with lower coefficients of patterns 10 and 12 representing inferior and superior para-ONH nerve thinning, respectively. Worse MD was associated most with higher coefficients of patterns 5, 4, and 9 (r = -0.16, r = -0.13, and r = -0.13, respectively), representing higher peripheral ONH and RNFL surfaces. In addition to established ONH summary parameters and 12-clock-hour RNFL thickness, using ONH and RNFL surface patterns improved (BIC decrease: 182, 144, and 101, respectively; BIC decrease \u2265 6; strong model improvement) the prediction of accompanied MD (r 2 from 0.32 to 0.37), superior (r 2 from 0.27 to 0.31), and inferior (r 2 from 0.17 to 0.21) paracentral loss and improved (BIC decrease: 8 and 8, respectively) the prediction of subsequent VF MD loss rates (r 2 from 0 to 0.13) and inferior paracentral loss rates (r 2 from 0 to 0.16).\nThe ONH and RNFL surface shape patterns quantified by unsupervised AI techniques improved the structure-function relationship and subsequent VF loss rate prediction.", "Human action recognition has a wide range of applications, including Ambient Intelligence systems and user assistance. Starting from the recognized actions performed by the user, a better human-computer interaction can be achieved, and improved assistance can be provided by social robots in real-time scenarios. In this context, the performance of the prediction system is a key aspect. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a neural network approach based on various types of convolutional layers that can achieve a good performance in recognizing actions but with a high inference speed. The experimental results show that our solution, based on a combination of graph convolutional networks (GCN) and temporal convolutional networks (TCN), is a suitable approach that reaches the proposed goal. In addition to the neural network model, we design a pipeline that contains two stages for obtaining relevant geometric features, data augmentation and data preprocessing, also contributing to an increased performance.", "Assisted reproductive technology is helping humans by addressing infertility using different medical procedures that help in a successful pregnancy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is one of those assisted reproduction methods in which the sperm and eggs are combined outside the human body in a specialized environment and kept for growth. Assisted reproductive technology is helping humans by addressing infertility using different medical procedures that help in a successful pregnancy. The morphology of the embryological components is highly related to the success of the assisted reproduction procedure. In approximately 3-5 days, the embryo transforms into the blastocyst. To prevent the multiple-birth risk and to increase the chance of pregnancy the embryologist manually analyzes the blastocyst components and selects valuable embryos to transfer to the women's uterus. The manual microscopic analysis of blastocyst components, such as trophectoderm, zona pellucida, blastocoel, and inner cell mass, is time-consuming and requires keen expertise to select a viable embryo. Artificial intelligence is easing medical procedures by the successful implementation of deep learning algorithms that mimic the medical doctor's knowledge to provide a better diagnostic procedure that helps in reducing the diagnostic burden. The deep learning-based automatic detection of these blastocyst components can help to analyze the morphological properties to select viable embryos. This research presents a deep learning-based embryo component segmentation network (ECS-Net) that accurately detects trophectoderm, zona pellucida, blastocoel, and inner cell mass for embryological analysis. The proposed method (ECS-Net) is based on a shallow deep segmentation network that uses two separate streams produced by a base convolutional block and a depth-wise separable convolutional block. Both streams are densely concatenated in combination with two dense skip paths to produce powerful features before and after upsampling. The proposed ECS-Net is evaluated on a publicly available microscopic blastocyst image dataset, the experimental segmentation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. The proposed ECS-Net is providing a mean Jaccard Index (Mean JI) of 85.93% for embryological analysis.", "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) represents a fundamental problem for autonomous embodied systems, for which the hippocampal/entorhinal system (H/E-S) has been optimized over the course of evolution. We have developed a biologically-inspired SLAM architecture based on latent variable generative modeling within the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (FEP-AI) framework, which affords flexible navigation and planning in mobile robots. We have primarily focused on attempting to reverse engineer H/E-S \"design\" properties, but here we consider ways in which SLAM principles from robotics may help us better understand nervous systems and emergent minds. After reviewing LatentSLAM and notable features of this control architecture, we consider how the H/E-S may realize these functional properties not only for physical navigation, but also with respect to high-level cognition understood as generalized simultaneous localization and mapping (G-SLAM). We focus on loop-closure, graph-relaxation, and node duplication as particularly impactful architectural features, suggesting these computational phenomena may contribute to understanding cognitive insight (as proto-causal-inference), accommodation (as integration into existing schemas), and assimilation (as category formation). All these operations can similarly be describable in terms of structure/category learning on multiple levels of abstraction. However, here we adopt an ecological rationality perspective, framing H/E-S functions as orchestrating SLAM processes within both concrete and abstract hypothesis spaces. In this navigation/search process, adaptive cognitive equilibration between assimilation and accommodation involves balancing tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation; this dynamic equilibrium may be near optimally realized in FEP-AI, wherein control systems governed by expected free energy objective functions naturally balance model simplicity and accuracy. With respect to structure learning, such a balance would involve constructing models and categories that are neither too inclusive nor exclusive. We propose these (generalized) SLAM phenomena may represent some of the most impactful sources of variation in cognition both within and between individuals, suggesting that modulators of H/E-S functioning may potentially illuminate their adaptive significances as fundamental cybernetic control parameters. Finally, we discuss how understanding H/E-S contributions to G-SLAM may provide a unifying framework for high-level cognition and its potential realization in artificial intelligences.", "Compressed ultrafast photography (CUP) is a type of two-dimensional (2D) imaging technique to observe ultrafast processes. Intelligence reconstruction methods that influence the imaging quality are an essential part of a CUP system. However, existing reconstruction algorithms mostly rely on image priors and complex parameter spaces. Therefore, it usually takes a lot of time to obtain acceptable reconstruction results, which limits the practical application of the CUP. In this paper, we proposed a novel reconstruction algorithm named PnP-FFDNet, which can provide a high quality and high efficiency compared to previous methods. First, we built a forward model of the CUP and three sub-optimization problems were obtained using the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM), and the closed-form solution of the first sub-optimization problem was derived. Secondly, inspired by the PnP-ADMM framework, we used an advanced denoising algorithm based on a neural network named FFDNet to solve the second sub-optimization problem. On the real CUP data, PSNR and SSIM are improved by an average of 3 dB and 0.06, respectively, compared with traditional algorithms. Both on the benchmark dataset and on the real CUP data, the proposed method reduces the running time by an average of about 96% over state-of-the-art algorithms, and show comparable visual results, but in a much shorter running time.", "Electronic skin with human-like sensory capabilities has been widely applied to artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, and the prosthetic hand for expanding the sensing ability of robots. Robotic electronic skin (RES) based on conductive hydrogel is developed to collect strain and pressure data for improving the grasping capability of the robot finger. RES is fabricated and assembled by the soft functional materials through a sol-gel process for guaranteeing the overall softness. The strain sensor based on piezoresistive hydrogel (gauge factor ~9.98) is integrated onto the back surface of the robot finger to collect the bending angle of the robot finger. The capacitive pressure sensor based on a hydrogel electrode (sensitivity: 0.105 kPa-1 below 3.61 kPa, and 0.0327 kPa-1 in the range from 4.12 to 15 kPa.) is adhered onto the fingertip to collect the pressure data when touching the objects. A robot-finger-compatible RES with strain and pressure sensing function is designed for finger gesture detection and grasping manipulation. The negative force feedback control framework is built to improve grasping manipulation of the robot finger with RES, which would provide a self-adaptive control method to determine whether the objects are grasped successfully or not. Robot fingers integrated with soft sensors would promote the development of sensing and grasping abilities of the robot finger and interaction with human beings.", "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) led to important solutions in the field of Computer Vision. More recently, forensic sciences benefited from the resources of artificial intelligence, especially in procedures that normally require operator-dependent steps. Forensic tools for sexual dimorphism based on morphological dental traits are available but have limited performance. This study aimed to test the application of a machine learning setup to distinguish females and males using dentomaxillofacial features from a radiographic dataset. The sample consisted of panoramic radiographs (n\u2009=\u20094003) of individuals in the age interval of 6 and 22.9\u00a0years. Image annotation was performed with V7 software (V7labs, London, UK). From Scratch (FS) and Transfer Learning (TL) CNN architectures were compared, and diagnostic accuracy tests were used. TL (82%) performed better than FS (71%). The correct classifications of females and males aged\u2009\u2265\u200915\u00a0years were 87% and 84%, respectively. For females and males\u2009<\u200915\u00a0years, the correct classifications were 80% and 83%, respectively. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) from Receiver-operating Characteristic (ROC) curves showed high classification accuracy between 0.87 and 0.91. The radio-diagnostic use of CNN for sexual dimorphism showed positive outcomes and promising forensic applications to the field of dental human identification.", "Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019, many studies have been carried out on artificial intelligence for the rapid diagnosis of the disease to support health services. Therefore, in this study, we present a powerful approach to detect COVID-19 and COVID-19 findings from computed tomography images using pre-trained models using two different datasets. COVID-19, influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia and healthy lung image classes were used in the first dataset. Consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, ground-glass opacity, ground-glass opacity and consolidation, ground-glass opacity and nodule classes were used in the second dataset. The study consists of four steps. In the first two steps, distinctive features were extracted from the final layers of the pre-trained ShuffleNet, GoogLeNet and MobileNetV2 models trained with the datasets. In the next steps, the most relevant features were selected from the models using the Sine-Cosine optimization algorithm. Then, the hyperparameters of the Support Vector Machines were optimized with the Bayesian optimization algorithm and used to reclassify the feature subset that achieved the highest accuracy in the third step. The overall accuracy obtained for the first and second datasets is 99.46% and 99.82%, respectively. Finally, the performance of the results visualized with Occlusion Sensitivity Maps was compared with Gradient-weighted class activation mapping. The approach proposed in this paper outperformed other methods in detecting COVID-19 from multiclass viral pneumonia. Moreover, detecting the stages of COVID-19 in the lungs was an innovative and successful approach.", "In this paper, we develop innovative digital twins of cattle status that are powered by artificial intelligence (AI). The work is built on a farm IoT system that remotely monitors and tracks the state of cattle. A digital twin model of cattle based on Deep Learning (DL) is generated using the sensor data acquired from the farm IoT system. The physiological cycle of cattle can be monitored in real time, and the state of the next physiological cycle of cattle can be anticipated using this model. The basis of this work is the vast amount of data that is required to validate the legitimacy of the digital twins model. In terms of behavioural state, this digital twin model has high accuracy, and the loss error of training reach about 0.580 and the loss error of predicting the next behaviour state of cattle is about 5.197 after optimization. The digital twins model developed in this work can be used to forecast the cattle's future time budget.", "During late pregnancy, sleep deterioration is regularly observed. In concert with these observations, in previous studies by other researchers, a slight objective cognitive decline in pregnant women has been found. Sleep is essential for memory consolidation. The hypothesis of the study was that cognitive impairment could be related to sleep deterioration during pregnancy. The study included 19 pregnant women in their third trimester of pregnancy (28\u221240 weeks, median 33 weeks (IQR 32\u221237)) recruited at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Medical University of Warsaw, and 20 non-pregnant women as controls. The assessment was performed using the vocabulary subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), D2 Test of Attention, OSPAN task (Operational Span Task) to assess cognitive performance, actigraphy to examine sleep parameters, and a set of self-report instruments: Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Ford Insomnia Response to Stress (FIRST), Regenstein Hyperarousal Scale (HS), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Although there were no differences between the groups in WAIS (p = 0.18), pregnant women had worse scores in working memory capacity (overall number of remembered letters: p = 0.012, WM span index: p = 0.004) and a significantly lower score in attention (p = 0.03). Pregnant women also had lower sleep efficiency (p = 0.001), more awakenings from sleep (p = 0.001), longer average awakenings (p < 0.0001), longer wake after sleep onset (WASO, p < 0.0001), and longer total time in bed (p < 0.0001). In psychological assessment, pregnant women had only a higher FIRST score (p = 0.02). Using mediation analysis, we found that frequent awakening might be the major factor contributing to deterioration in working memory performance, explaining almost 40% of the total effect. In conclusion, sleep fragmentation in the third trimester of pregnancy may impair working memory consolidation. Pregnant women often complain about poor daily performance as well as non-restorative sleep. In this study, we showed that there is a relationship between lower sleep quality in pregnancy and worse cognitive functioning. We can expect a cognitive decline in women with sleep disturbances in pregnancy. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the treatment of sleep disorders in pregnancy.", "Regulation of health technologies must be rigorous, instilling trust among both healthcare providers and patients. This is especially important for the control and supervision of the growing use of artificial intelligence in healthcare. In this commentary on the accompanying piece by Van Laere and colleagues, we set out the scope for applying artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector and outline five key challenges that regulators face in dealing with these modern-day technologies. Addressing these challenges will not be easy. While artificial intelligence applications in healthcare have already made rapid progress and benefitted patients, these applications clearly hold even more potential for future developments. Yet it is vital that the regulatory environment keep up with this fast-evolving space of healthcare in order to anticipate and, to the extent possible, prevent the risks that may arise.", "This study aimed to assess morphological changes in the retinal microvasculature and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in patients with ischemic stroke and its different subtypes.\nThirty-three patients with ischemic stroke (14 with nonlacunar infarction and 19 with lacunar infarction) and 27 control participants were enrolled in this study. Based on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), three vascular parameters, including vascular area density, vascular fractal dimension (VFD), and vascular orientation distribution (VOD), and four FAZ-related parameters, including FAZ area, FAZ axis ratio (FAR), FAZ circularity (FC), and FAZ roundness, in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) were extracted and analyzed.\nLogistic regression results showed that worse best-corrected visual acuity (odds ratio [OR], 0.21), higher FAR (OR, 2.77) and lower FC (OR, 0.36) of the DCP were associated with ischemic stroke. Furthermore, lower VOD of the SCP was significantly associated with lacunar infarction compared with nonlacunar infarction.\nOur study shows that the FAR and FC of the DCP may be potential biomarkers of ischemic stroke. Moreover, we demonstrated that OCT showed specific damage patterns in retinal microvascular and macular morphology in different subtypes of ischemic stroke.\nThis work lays the foundation for the pathophysiological characteristics of cerebrovascular diseases assisted by retinal imaging and artificial intelligence.", "We aimed to develop a deep learning (DL)-based algorithm for early glaucoma detection based on color fundus photographs that provides information on defects in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and its thickness from the mapping and translating relations of spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) thickness maps.\nDeveloping and evaluating an artificial intelligence detection tool.\nPretraining paired data of color fundus photographs and SD-OCT images from 189 healthy participants and 371 patients with early glaucoma were used.\nThe variational autoencoder (VAE) network training architecture was used for training, and the correlation between the fundus photographs and RNFL thickness distribution was determined through the deep neural network. The reference standard was defined as a vertical cup-to-disc ratio of \u22650.7, other typical changes in glaucomatous optic neuropathy, and RNFL defects. Convergence indicates that the VAE has learned a distribution that would enable us to produce corresponding synthetic OCT scans.\nSimilarly to wide-field OCT scanning, the proposed model can extract the results of RNFL thickness analysis. The structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) were used to assess signal strength and the similarity in the structure of the color fundus images converted to an RNFL thickness distribution model. The differences between the model-generated images and original images were quantified.\nWe developed and validated a novel DL-based algorithm to extract thickness information from the color space of fundus images similarly to that from OCT images and to use this information to regenerate RNFL thickness distribution images. The generated thickness map was sufficient for clinical glaucoma detection, and the generated images were similar to ground truth (PSNR: 19.31 decibels; SSIM: 0.44). The inference results were similar to the OCT-generated original images in terms of the ability to predict RNFL thickness distribution.\nThe proposed technique may aid clinicians in early glaucoma detection, especially when only color fundus photographs are available.", "Caregiver workload in the ICU setting is difficult to numerically quantify. Ambient Intelligence utilises computer vision-guided neural networks to continuously monitor multiple datapoints in video feeds, has become increasingly efficient at automatically tracking various aspects of human movement.\nTo assess the feasibility of using Ambient Intelligence to track and quantify allpatient and caregiver activity within a bedspace over the course of an ICU admission and also to establish patient specific factors, and environmental factors such as time ofday, that might contribute to an increased workload in ICU workers.\n5000 images were manually annotated and then used to train You Only LookOnce (YOLOv4), an open-source computer vision algorithm. Comparison of patientmotion and caregiver activity was then performed between these patients.\nThe algorithm was deployed on 14 patients comprising 1762800 framesof new, untrained data. There was a strong correlation between the number ofcaregivers in the room and the standardized movement of the patient (p < 0.0001) withmore caregivers associated with more movement. There was a significant difference incaregiver activity throughout the day (p < 0.05), HDU vs. ICU status (p < 0.05), delirious vs. non delirious patients (p < 0.05), and intubated vs. not intubated patients(p < 0.05). Caregiver activity was lowest between 0400 and 0800 (average .71 \u00b1 .026caregivers per hour) with statistically significant differences in activity compared to 0800-2400 (p < 0.05). Caregiver activity was highest between 1200 and 1600 (1.02 \u00b1 .031 caregivers per hour) with a statistically significant difference in activity comparedto activity from 1600 to 0800 (p < 0.05). The three most dominant predictors of workeractivity were patient motion (Standardized Dominance 78.6%), Mechanical Ventilation(Standardized Dominance 7.9%) and Delirium (Standardized Dominance 6.2%).\nAmbient Intelligence could potentially be used to derive a single standardized metricthat could be applied to patients to illustrate their overall workload. This could be usedto predict workflow demands for better staff deployment, monitoring of caregiver workload, and potentially as a tool to predict burnout.", "This study aimed to evaluate the artificial intelligence (AI)-based coronary artery calcium (CAC) quantification and regional distribution of CAC on non-gated chest CT, using standard electrocardiograph (ECG)-gated CAC scoring as the reference.\nIn this retrospective study, a total of 405 patients underwent non-gated chest CT and standard ECG-gated cardiac CT. An AI-based algorithm was used for automated CAC scoring on chest CT, and Agatston score on cardiac CT was manually quantified. Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate the agreement of absolute Agatston score between the two scans at the patient and vessel levels. Linearly weighted kappa (\u03ba) was calculated to assess the reliability of AI-based CAC risk categorization and the number of involved vessels on chest CT.\nThe AI-based algorithm showed moderate reliability for the number of involved vessels in comparison to measures on cardiac CT (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.75, 95% CI 0.70-0.79, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and an assignment agreement of 76%. Considerable coronary arteries with CAC were not identified with a per-vessel false-negative rate of 59.3%, 17.8%, 34.9%, and 34.7% for LM, LAD, CX, and RCA on chest CT. The leading causes for false negatives of LM were motion artifact (56.3%, 18/32) and segmentation error (43.8%, 14/32). The motion artifact was almost the only cause for false negatives of LAD (96.6%, 28/29), CX (96.7%, 29/30), and RCA (100%, 34/34). Absolute Agatston scores on chest CT were underestimated either for the patient and individual vessels except for LAD (median difference: -\u200912.5, -\u200911.3, -\u20095.6, -\u200918.6 for total, LM, CX, and RCA, all P\u2009<\u20090.01; -\u20092.5 for LAD, P\u2009=\u20090.18). AI-based total Agatston score yielded good reliability for risk categorization (weighted \u03ba 0.86, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and an assignment agreement of 86.7% on chest CT, with a per-patient false-negative rate of 15.2% (28/184) and false-positive rate of 0.5% (1/221) respectively.\nAI-based per-patient CAC quantification on non-gated chest CT achieved a good agreement with dedicated ECG-gated CAC scoring overall and highly reliable CVD risk categorization, despite a slight but significant underestimation. However, it is challenging to evaluate the regional distribution of CAC without ECG-synchronization.", "The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) convened a workshop of international experts to discuss new research opportunities for the prevention, detection, and intervention of myocarditis in May 2021. These experts reviewed the current state of science and identified key gaps and opportunities in basic, diagnostic, translational, and therapeutic frontiers to guide future research in myocarditis. In addition to addressing community-acquired myocarditis, the workshop also focused on emerging causes of myocarditis including immune checkpoint inhibitors and SARS-CoV-2 related myocardial injuries and considered the use of systems biology and artificial intelligence methodologies to define workflows to identify novel mechanisms of disease and new therapeutic targets. A new priority is the investigation of the relationship between social determinants of health (SDoH), including race and economic status, and inflammatory response and outcomes in myocarditis. The result is a proposal for the reclassification of myocarditis that integrates the latest knowledge of immunological pathogenesis to refine estimates of prognosis and target pathway-specific treatments.", "Businesses need to use sentiment analysis, powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning to forecast accurately whether or not consumers are satisfied with their offerings. This paper uses a deep learning model to analyze thousands of reviews of Amazon Alexa to predict customer sentiment. The proposed model can be directly applied to any company with an online presence to detect customer sentiment from their reviews automatically. This research aims to present a suitable method for analyzing the users' reviews of Amazon Echo and categorizing them into positive or negative thoughts. A dataset containing reviews of 3150 users has been used in this research work. Initially, a word cloud of positive and negative reviews was plotted, which gave a lot of insight from the text data. After that, a deep learning model using a multinomial naive Bayesian classifier was built and trained using 80% of the dataset. Then the remaining 20% of the dataset was used to test the model. The proposed model gives 93% accuracy. The proposed model has also been compared with four models used in the same domain, outperforming three.", "The efficacy and safety of drugs are widely known to be determined by their interactions with multiple molecules of pharmacological importance, and it is therefore essential to systematically depict the molecular atlas and pharma-information of studied drugs. However, our understanding of such information is neither comprehensive nor precise, which necessitates the construction of a new database providing a network containing a large number of drugs and their interacting molecules. Here, a new database describing the molecular atlas and pharma-information of drugs (DrugMAP) was therefore constructed. It provides a comprehensive list of interacting molecules for\u00a0>30 000 drugs/drug candidates, gives the differential expression patterns for\u00a0>5000 interacting molecules among different disease sites, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)-relevant organs and physiological tissues, and weaves a comprehensive and precise network containing\u00a0>200 000 interactions among drugs and molecules. With the great efforts made to clarify the complex mechanism underlying drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and rapidly emerging interests in artificial intelligence (AI)-based network analyses, DrugMAP is expected to become an indispensable supplement to existing databases to facilitate drug discovery. It is now fully and freely accessible at: https://idrblab.org/drugmap/.", "This paper presents two novel swarm intelligence algorithms for gene selection, HHO-SVM and HHO-KNN. Both of these algorithms are based on Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), one in conjunction with support vector machines (SVM) and the other in conjunction with k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). In both algorithms, the goal is to determine a small gene subset that can be used to classify samples with a high degree of accuracy. The proposed algorithms are divided into two phases. To obtain an accurate gene set and to deal with the challenge of high-dimensional data, the redundancy analysis and relevance calculation are conducted in the first phase. To solve the gene selection problem, the second phase applies SVM and k-NN with leave-one-out cross-validation. A performance evaluation was performed on six microarray data sets using the two proposed algorithms. A comparison of the two proposed algorithms with several known algorithms indicates that both of them perform quite well in terms of classification accuracy and the number of selected genes.", "Tonometry is commonly used to provide efficient and good diagnostics for cardiovascular disease (CVD). There are many advantages of this method, including low cost, non-invasiveness and little time to perform. In this study, the effort was undertaken to check whether tonometry data hides valuable information associated with different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treatment. For this purpose, six groups containing patients at different stages of CKD following different ways of dialysis treatment, as well as patients without CKD but with CVD and healthy volunteers were assessed. It was revealed that each of the studied groups had a unique profile. Only the type of dialysis was indistinguishable a from tonometric perspective (hemodialysis vs. peritoneal dialysis). Several techniques were used to build profiles that independently gave the same outcome: analysis of variance, network correlation structure analysis, multinomial logistic regression, and discrimination analysis. Moreover, to evaluate the classification potential of the discriminatory model, all mentioned techniques were later compared and treated as feature selection methods. Although the results are promising, it could be difficult to express differences as simple mathematical relations. This study shows that artificial intelligence can differentiate between different stages of CKD and patients without CKD. Potential future machine learning models will be able to determine kidney health with high accuracy and thereby classify patients. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05214872.", "Cavitation is a physical process that produces different negative effects on the components working in conditions where it acts. One is the materials' mass loss by corrosion-erosion when it is introduced into fluids under cavitation. This research aims at modeling the mass variation of three samples (copper, brass, and bronze) in a cavitation field produced by ultrasound in water, using four artificial intelligence methods-SVR, GRNN, GEP, and RBF networks. Utilizing six goodness-of-fit indicators (R2, MAE, RMSE, MAPE, CV, correlation between the recorded and computed values), it is shown that the best results are provided by GRNN, followed by SVR. The novelty of the approach resides in the experimental data collection and analysis.", "Breast cancer survivors have to deal with notable challenges even after successful treatment, such as body image issues, depression and anxiety, the stress related to changes in lifestyle, and the continual challenges inherent to health management. The literature suggests that emotional abilities, such as emotional intelligence, emotion management, mood repair, and coping play a fundamental role in such challenges. We performed a systematic review to systematize the evidence available on the role of emotional abilities in quality of life and health management in breast cancer survivors. The search was performed on three scientific databases (Pubmed, Scopus, and PsycINFO) and, after applying exclusion criteria, yielded 33 studies, mainly of a cross-sectional nature. The results clearly support the hypothesis that emotional abilities play multiple important roles in breast cancer survivors' quality of life. Specifically, the review highlighted that coping/emotional management plays multiple roles in breast cancer survivors' well-being and health management, affecting vitality and general adjustment to cancer positivity and promoting benefit findings related to the cancer experience; however, rare negative results exist in the literature. This review highlights the relevance of emotional abilities to promoting quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Future review efforts may explore other breast cancer survivors' emotional abilities, aiming at assessing available instruments and proposing tailored psychological interventions.", "Colorectal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is correlated with genetic and epigenetic alterations in the colonic epithelium. Genetic changes play a major role in the pathophysiology of colorectal cancer through the development of gene mutations, but recent research has shown an important role for epigenetic alterations. In this review, we try to describe the current knowledge about epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as the role of non-coding RNAs as epigenetic regulators and the prognostic and predictive biomarkers in metastatic colorectal disease that can allow increases in the effectiveness of treatments. Additionally, the intestinal microbiota's composition can be an important biomarker for the response to strategies based on the immunotherapy of CRC. The identification of biomarkers in mCRC can be enhanced by developing artificial intelligence programs. We present the actual models that implement AI technology as a bridge connecting ncRNAs with tumors and conducted some experiments to improve the quality of the model used as well as the speed of the model that provides answers to users. In order to carry out this task, we implemented six algorithms: the naive Bayes classifier, the random forest classifier, the decision tree classifier, gradient boosted trees, logistic regression and SVM.", "The\u00a0study aims to investigate the association of aspiration for future occupation, socioeconomic position, and intellectual abilities with risk of dual diagnosis, psychosis, substance use disorder (SUD) in later life, and to explore if social and intellectual disadvantage modify any effect of childhood aspirations on outcomes. The study included 7177 Danish boys born in 1953. We investigated childhood aspirations (preference regarding future occupation), socioeconomic position (paternal social group), and intellectual abilities (H\u00e4rnquist intelligence score) on outcomes with dual diagnosis, psychotic disorder, or SUD in Danish registers. Combinations of variables were used for a two-way and three-way analysis (high and low levels of exposure variables). Cox regression with age as the underlying time scale was used for analysis. The separate analysis showed no associations between childhood aspirations and outcomes. Boys with low intelligence scores had an increased risk of developing psychotic disorders (aHR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1) and SUD (aHR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.1) compared to high intelligence scores. The interaction analyses showed that individuals with a combination of low intelligence score, high aspirations, and/or high paternal social group might have an increased risk of developing dual diagnosis, psychotic disorders, or SUD in later life. This result should be interpreted with caution as interaction variables were not overall significant with the outcome of dual diagnosis or psychotic disorder. The findings suggest that childhood abilities and social position could be associated with the development of psychotic disorders and SUD in later life, however, further studies are needed to address the temporality of the association to gain an understanding of the underlying mechanism of the association.", "In this Series paper, we explore the promises and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI)-based precision medicine tools in mental health care from clinical, ethical, and regulatory perspectives. The real-world implementation of these tools is increasingly considered the prime solution for key issues in mental health, such as delayed, inaccurate, and inefficient care delivery. Similarly, machine-learning-based empirical strategies are becoming commonplace in psychiatric research because of their potential to adequately deconstruct the biopsychosocial complexity of mental health disorders, and hence to improve nosology of prognostic and preventive paradigms. However, the implementation steps needed to translate these promises into practice are currently hampered by multiple interacting challenges. These obstructions range from the current technology-distant state of clinical practice, over the lack of valid real-world databases required to feed data-intensive AI algorithms, to model development and validation considerations being disconnected from the core principles of clinical utility and ethical acceptability. In this Series paper, we provide recommendations on how these challenges could be addressed from an interdisciplinary perspective to pave the way towards a framework for mental health care, leveraging the combined strengths of human intelligence and AI.", "The population of patients with cancer is rapidly expanding, and the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular complications greatly rely on imaging. Numerous advances in the field of cardio-oncology and imaging have occurred in recent years. This review presents updated and practical approaches for multimodality cardiovascular imaging in the cardio-oncology patient and provides recommendations for imaging to detect the myriad of adverse cardiovascular effects associated with antineoplastic therapy, such as cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, vascular toxicity, myocarditis, valve disease, and cardiac masses. Uniquely, we address the role of cardiovascular imaging in patients with pre-existing cardiomyopathy, pregnant patients, long-term survivors, and populations with limited resources. We also address future avenues of investigation and opportunities for artificial intelligence applications in cardio-oncology imaging. This review provides a uniform practical approach to cardiovascular imaging for patients with cancer.", "Background: Microsoft Windows Security is a recently implemented safeguard for the Windows operating systems, including the latest versions of Windows10 and 11. However, there is a major shortcoming in this system to stop Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). These are government-financed groups that are funded to attack other government entities. Following the initial security breach, the hacked Windows device is used to access the rest of the network devices in order to transfer data to external storage (Exfiltration). Methods: In this work, we have tested the Microsoft Windows Security system using MITRE CALDERA and ATT&CK frameworks and explain how APT groups are able to bypass Windows Security. Results: In this study we used \"54ndc47\" agent through GoLang feature in MITRE CALDERA platform to test and bypass Microsoft Windows Security systems (MS Windows 10). Through it, we were able to bypass the Windows Security system and display entire files in the victim's device. Conclusions: In this paper, we have provided recommendations to Microsoft to improve their Windows Security tool through the use of Artificial intelligence (AI).", "Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and early LC diagnosis can significantly improve outcomes and survival rates in affected patients. Implementation of LC screening programs using low-dose computed tomography CT in high-risk subjects aims to detect LC as early as possible, but so far, adoption of screening programs into routine clinical care has been very slow. In recent years, the use of CT has significantly increased the rate of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules. Although most of those incidental pulmonary nodules (IPNs) are benign, some of them represent early-stage LC. Given the large number of IPNs detected in the range of several millions each year, this represents an additional, maybe even larger, opportunity to drive stage shift in LC diagnosis, next to LC screening programs. Comprehensive evaluation and targeted work-up of IPNs are mandatory to identify the malignant nodules from the crowd, and several guidelines provide radiologists and physicians' guidance on IPN assessment and management. However, IPNs still seem to be inadequately processed due to various reasons including insufficient reporting in the radiological report, missing communication between stakeholders, absence of patient tracking systems, and uncertainty regarding responsibilities for the IPN management. In recent years, several approaches such as lung nodule programs, patient tracking software, artificial intelligence, and communication software were introduced into clinical practice to address those shortcomings. This review evaluates the current situation of IPN management and highlights recent developments in process improvement to achieve first steps toward stage shift in LC diagnosis.", "Due to its increasing prevalence, breast cancer has become a serious public health problem. In addition to the models used to identify individuals at risk, the search for fast and accurate tools has continued for years.\nIn our study, we aimed to examine the correlation of mammographic density measurement and serum Mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) levels with an effective model such as Gail.\nOf the women whose serum MIS levels were measured in the last 1\u00a0year, 214 participants who applied for routine breast examination were included in the study. The age range was between 40 and 60. Exclusion criteria were determined as pathological mammographic findings, active breast symptom, and thoracic radiotherapy history. Mammographic density measurement (PD) was performed with the artificial intelligence-based Deep-LIBRA software. The relationship of these two parameters with the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was examined.\nThe correlation between PD and GRP was remarkable (p\u2009<\u20090.01\u00a0cc:0.35). A positive correlation was observed between serum MIS levels and increased breast cancer, but it was not possible to prove this statistically (p\u2009=\u20090.056). It was thought that this situation was caused by perimenopausal patients. Because when the menopause group was excluded, the correlation between MIS levels and GRP decreased (p\u2009=\u20090.12\u00a0cc:0.17).\nPD measurement can be considered as a promising method for the determination of individuals at risk for breast cancer in a large group of patients, but we think that serum MIS levels are not suitable for risk assessment in perimenopausal patients.", "Conventional radiomics in nuclear medicine involve hand-crafted and computer-assisted regions of interest. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have seen the emergence of AI-augmented segmentation and extraction of lower order traditional radiomic features. Deep learning (DL) affords the opportunity to extract abstract radiomic features directly from input tensors (images) without the need for segmentation. These fourth-order, high dimensional radiomics produce deep radiomics and are well suited to the data density associated with the molecular nature of hybrid imaging. Molecular radiomics and deep molecular radiomics provide insights beyond images and quantitation typical of semantic reporting. While the application of molecular radiomics using hand-crafted and computer-generated features is integrated into decision-making in nuclear medicine, the acceptance of deep molecular radiomics is less universal. This manuscript aims to provide an understanding of the language and principles associated with radiomics and deep radiomics in nuclear medicine.", "Active ageing is described as the process of optimizing health, empowerment, and security to enhance the quality of life in the rapidly growing population of older adults. Meanwhile, multimorbidity and neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), lead to global public health and resource limitations. We introduce a novel user-centered paradigm of ageing based on wearable-driven artificial intelligence (AI) that may harness the autonomy and independence that accompany functional limitation or disability, and possibly elevate life expectancy in older adults and people with PD.\nActiveAgeing is a 4-year, multicentre, mixed method, cyclic study that combines digital phenotyping via commercial devices (Empatica E4, Fitbit Sense, and Oura Ring) with traditional evaluation (clinical assessment scales, in-depth interviews, and clinical consultations) and includes four types of participants: (1) people with PD and (2) their informal caregiver; (3) healthy older adults from the Helgetun living environment in Norway, and (4) people on the Helgetun waiting list. For the first study, each group will be represented by N = 15 participants to test the data acquisition and to determine the sample size for the second study. To suggest lifestyle changes, modules for human expert-based advice, machine-generated advice, and self-generated advice from accessible data visualization will be designed. Quantitative analysis of physiological data will rely on digital signal processing (DSP) and AI techniques. The clinical assessment scales are the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI), Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), and the REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ). A qualitative inquiry will be carried out with individual and focus group interviews and analysed using a hermeneutic approach including narrative and thematic analysis techniques.\nWe hypothesise that digital phenotyping is feasible to explore the ageing process from clinical and lifestyle perspectives including older adults and people with PD. Data is used for clinical decision-making by symptom tracking, predicting symptom evolution, and discovering new outcome measures for clinical trials.", "With the development of modern Internet technology, the health assessment model based on computer technology has gradually become a research hotspot. In the process of studying the health level of residents, exercise status and diet nutrition are important factors affecting their health. Therefore, based on the idea of the genetic algorithm, this paper establishes a resident sports nutrition data monitoring system. In this system, the data feature selection method of the genetic algorithm, which simulates the process of biological evolution, is used in the key technology of real-time motion data processing of residents, and it is improved to interfere with the data cross process of the genetic algorithm, to seek the local optimal solution. Two different types of data sets and different data classifiers are selected to verify the system's performance. It is proved that compared with the traditional filter class feature selection method, this method can achieve more effective data feature recognition. In addition, some samples are selected to test the residents' sports nutrition data monitoring system, mainly through the analysis and quantification of the exercise process, eating habits, physique, and other data of the athletes; to evaluate the impact of their sports and eating habits on physical health; and to obtain the best sports guidance scheme, to guide the adjustment and improvement of their later sports and eating plans. Through the analysis of the existing residents' health status, the monitoring and management strategies of residents' health status are summarized, which provides a certain reference for the improvement of residents' physical health under the background of artificial intelligence.", "Artificial intelligence-based computer-aid detection (CADe) devices have been recently tested in colonoscopies, increasing the adenoma detection rate (ADR), mainly in Asian populations. However, evidence for the benefit of these devices in the occidental population is still low. We tested a new CADe device, namely, ENDO-AID (OIP-1) (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), in clinical practice.\nThis randomized controlled trial included 370 consecutive patients who were randomized 1:1 to CADe (n\u00a0= 185) versus standard exploration (n\u00a0= 185) from November 2021 to January 2022. The primary endpoint was the ADR. Advanced adenoma was defined as\u00a0\u226510\u00a0mm, harboring high-grade dysplasia, or with a villous pattern. Otherwise, the adenoma was nonadvanced. ADR was assessed in both groups stratified by endoscopist ADR and colon cleansing.\nIn the intention-to-treat analysis, the ADR was 55.1% (102/185) in the CADe group and 43.8% (81/185) in the control group (P\u00a0= .029). Nonadvanced ADRs (54.8% vs 40.8%, P\u00a0= .01) and flat ADRs (39.4 vs 24.8, P\u00a0= .006), polyp detection rate (67.1% vs 51%; P\u00a0= .004), and number of adenomas per colonoscopy were significantly higher in the CADe group than in the control group (median [25th-75th percentile], 1 [0-2] vs 0 [0-1.5], respectively; P\u00a0= .014). No significant differences were found in serrated ADR. After stratification by endoscopist and bowel cleansing, no statistically significant differences in ADR were found.\nColonoscopy assisted by ENDO-AID (OIP-1) increases ADR and number of adenomas per colonoscopy, suggesting it may aid in the detection of colorectal neoplastic lesions, especially because of its detection of diminutive and flat adenomas. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT04945044.).", "Intraoperative hypotension is common and has been associated with adverse events. Although association does not imply causation, predicting and preventing hypotension may improve postoperative outcomes. This review summarizes current evidence on the development and validation of an artificial intelligence predictive algorithm, the Hypotension Prediction (HPI) (formerly known as the Hypotension Probability Indicator). This machine learning model can arguably predict hypotension up to 15 min before its occurrence. Several validation studies, retrospective cohorts, as well as a few prospective randomized trials, have been published in the last years, reporting promising results. Larger trials are needed to definitively assess the usefulness of this algorithm in optimizing postoperative outcomes.", "Deep learning models with imbalanced data sets are a challenge in the fields of artificial intelligence and surgery. The aim of this study was to develop and compare deep learning models that predict rare but devastating postoperative complications after abdominal wall reconstruction.\nA prospectively maintained institutional database was used to identify abdominal wall reconstruction patients with preoperative computed tomography scans. Conventional deep learning models were developed using an 8-layer convolutional neural network and a 2-class training system (ie, learns negative and positive outcomes). Conventional deep learning models were compared to deep learning models that were developed using a generative adversarial network anomaly framework, which uses image augmentation and anomaly detection. The primary outcomes were receiver operating characteristic values for predicting mesh infection and pulmonary failure.\nComputed tomography scans from 510 patients were used with a total of 10,004 images. Mesh infection and pulmonary failure occurred in 3.7% and 5.6% of patients, respectively. The conventional deep learning models were less effective than generative adversarial network anomaly for predicting mesh infection (receiver operating characteristic 0.61 vs 0.73, P < .01) and pulmonary failure (receiver operating characteristic 0.59 vs 0.70, P < .01). Although the conventional deep learning models had higher accuracies/specificities for predicting mesh infection (0.93 vs 0.78, P < .01/.96 vs .78, P < .01) and pulmonary failure (0.88 vs 0.68, P < .01/.92 vs .67, P < .01), they were substantially compromised by decreased model sensitivity (0.25 vs 0.68, P < .01/.27 vs .73, P < .01).\nCompared to conventional deep learning models, generative adversarial network anomaly deep learning models showed improved performance on imbalanced data sets, predominantly by increasing model sensitivity. Understanding patients who are at risk for rare but devastating postoperative complications can improve risk stratification, resource utilization, and the consent process.", "Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a cause of profound morbidity and mortality. Its effects extend beyond functional neurological status to neurocognitive and psychological functioning. Endovascular treatment is becoming more prevalent after increasing evidence for its safety and efficacy; however, there is a relative paucity of evidence specific to neurocognitive status after treatment.\nTo assess and compare neuropsychological outcomes after the treatment of ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms.\nA systematic review of the literature was conducted searching for articles assessing the neuropsychological and cognitive outcomes after the treatment of ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Inclusion criteria were English language, publication between January 2000 and October 2020, and discussion of neuropsychological outcomes in adequate detail. Outcomes were categorized into 8 domains: 5 Neurocognitive (Language, Executive Function, Complex Attention, Memory and Learning, and Perceptual motor function), Intelligence Quotient, Affect, and Quality of Life.\nTwenty-four articles were included comprising 2236 patients (924 surgical clipping, 1095 endovascular coiling, and 217 controls). These studies reported that most tests revealed no significant difference [n = 356/421 (84.56%)] between treatment modalities. More studies reported significantly superior test scores in the fields of language, executive function, and memory and learning after coiling [n = 53/421 tests (12.59%)] compared with clipping [n = 12/421 tests (2.85%)].\nThe current available data and published studies demonstrate a trend toward improved neurocognitive and psychological outcomes after endovascular treatment. Although these findings should be considered when deciding on the optimal treatment method for each patient, drawing definitive conclusions is difficult because of heterogeneity between patients and studies.", "The design of a new therapeutic agent is a time-consuming and expensive process. The rise of machine intelligence provides a grand opportunity of expeditiously discovering novel drug candidates through smart search in the vast molecular structural space. In this paper, we propose a new approach called adversarial deep evolutionary learning (ADEL) to search for novel molecules in the latent space of an adversarial generative model and keep improving the latent representation space. In ADEL, a custom-made adversarial autoencoder (AAE) model is developed and trained under a deep evolutionary learning (DEL) process. This involves an initial training of the AAE model, followed by an integration of multi-objective evolutionary optimization in the continuous latent representation space of the AAE rather than the discrete structural space of molecules. By using the AAE, an arbitrary distribution can be provided to the training of AAE such that the latent representation space is set to that distribution. This allows for a starting latent space from which new samples can be produced. Throughout the process of learning, new samples of high quality are generated after each iteration of training and then added back into the full dataset, therefore, allowing for a more comprehensive procedure of understanding the data structure. This combination of evolving data and continuous learning not only enables improvement in the generative model, but the data as well. By comparing ADEL to the previous work in DEL, we see that ADEL can obtain better property distributions. We show that ADEL is able to design high-quality molecular structures which can be further used for virtual and experimental screenings.", "The importance of ethics in research and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly recognized not only in the field of healthcare but throughout society. This article intends to provide domestic readers with practical points regarding the ethical issues of using radiological images for AI research, focusing on data security and privacy protection and the right to data. Therefore, this article refers to related domestic laws and government policies. Data security and privacy protection is a key ethical principle for AI, in which proper de-identification of data is crucial. Sharing healthcare data to develop AI in a way that minimizes business interests is another ethical point to be highlighted. The need for data sharing makes the data security and privacy protection even more important as data sharing increases the risk of data breach.\n\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uac1c\ubc1c \ubc0f \ud65c\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc724\ub9ac\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc758\ub8cc\ubd84\uc57c\ubfd0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc804 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\ucc28 \ub110\ub9ac \uc778\uc2dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc885\uc124\uc740 \uc601\uc0c1\uc758\ud559 \uc601\uc0c1\ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ubcf4\ud638 \ubc0f \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uad8c\ub9ac \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud560 \uc0ac\ud56d\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c \uad6d\ub0b4 \ub3c5\uc790\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc774 \uae00\uc5d0 \ub2f4\uae34 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc740 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uad6d\ub0b4\ubc95\uacfc \uc815\ubd80 \uc81c\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uac1c\ubc1c \ubc0f \ud65c\uc6a9\uc5d0\uc11c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc6d0\uce59\uc774\uba70 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uac00\uba85\ucc98\ub9ac\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \uc544\uc6b8\ub7ec \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uc5f0\uad6c \uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0 \uc758\ub8cc \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc801 \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uba70 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacf5\uc720\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\ub3c4 \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uacf5\uc720\ub294 \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \uc720\ucd9c\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ubbc0\ub85c \uac1c\uc778\uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\ud638\uc5d0 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc8fc\uc758\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has branched out to various applications in healthcare, such as health services management, predictive medicine, clinical decision-making, and patient data and diagnostics. Although AI models have achieved human-like performance, their use is still limited because they are seen as a black box. This lack of trust remains the main reason for their low use in practice, especially in healthcare. Hence, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has been introduced as a technique that can provide confidence in the model's prediction by explaining how the prediction is derived, thereby encouraging the use of AI systems in healthcare. The primary goal of this review is to provide areas of healthcare that require more attention from the XAI research community.\nMultiple journal databases were thoroughly searched using PRISMA guidelines 2020. Studies that do not appear in Q1 journals, which are highly credible, were excluded.\nIn this review, we surveyed 99 Q1 articles covering the following XAI techniques: SHAP, LIME, GradCAM, LRP, Fuzzy classifier, EBM, CBR, rule-based systems, and others.\nWe discovered that detecting abnormalities in 1D biosignals and identifying key text in clinical notes are areas that require more attention from the XAI research community. We hope this is review will encourage the development of a holistic cloud system for a smart city.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being developed to support clinical decisions for better health service quality, but the adoption of AI in hospitals is not as popular as expected. A possible reason is that the unclear AI explainability (XAI) affects the physicians' consideration of adopting the model.\nTo propose and validate an innovative conceptual model aimed at exploring physicians' intention to use AI with XAI as an antecedent variable of technology trust (TT) and perceived value (PV).\nA questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data from physicians of three hospitals in Taiwan. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to validate the proposed model and test the hypotheses.\nA total of 295 valid questionnaires were collected. The research results showed that physicians expressed a high intention to use AI. The XAI was found to be of great importance and had a significant impact both on AI TT and PV. We also observed that TT in AI had a significant impact on PV. Moreover, physicians' PV and TT in AI had a significant impact on their behavioral intention to use AI (BI). However, XAI's impact on BI cannot be proved.\nThe conceptual model developed in this study provides empirical evidence that could be used as guidelines to effectively explore physicians' intention to use medical AI from the antecedent of XAI. Our findings contribute crucial AI-human interaction insights in health care studies.", "The advent of massive DNA sequencing technologies is producing a huge number of human single-nucleotide polymorphisms occurring in protein-coding regions and possibly changing their sequences. Discriminating harmful protein variations from neutral ones is one of the crucial challenges in precision medicine. Computational tools based on artificial intelligence provide models for protein sequence encoding, bypassing database searches for evolutionary information. We leverage the new encoding schemes for an efficient annotation of protein variants.\nE-SNPs&GO is a novel method that, given an input protein sequence and a single amino acid variation, can predict whether the variation is related to diseases or not. The proposed method adopts an input encoding completely based on protein language models and embedding techniques, specifically devised to encode protein sequences and GO functional annotations. We trained our model on a newly generated dataset of 101\u00a0146 human protein single amino acid variants in 13\u00a0661 proteins, derived from public resources. When tested on a blind set comprising 10\u00a0266 variants, our method well compares to recent approaches released in literature for the same task, reaching a Matthews Correlation Coefficient score of 0.72. We propose E-SNPs&GO as a suitable, efficient and accurate large-scale annotator of protein variant datasets.\nThe method is available as a webserver at https://esnpsandgo.biocomp.unibo.it.

This paper developed a two-mode underwater surveillance camera system consisting of a sonar imaging device and a stereo camera. The sonar imaging device has two cloud-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) functions that estimate the quantity and the distribution of the length and weight of fish in a crowded fish school. Because sonar images can be noisy and fish instances of an overcrowded fish school are often overlapped, machine learning technologies, such as Mask R-CNN, Gaussian mixture models, convolutional neural networks, and semantic segmentation networks were employed to address the difficulty in the analysis of fish in sonar images. Furthermore, the sonar and stereo RGB images were aligned in the 3D space, offering an additional AI function for fish annotation based on RGB images. The proposed two-mode surveillance camera was tested to collect data from aquaculture tanks and off-shore net cages using a cloud-based AIoT system. The accuracy of the proposed AI functions based on human-annotated fish metric data sets were tested to verify the feasibility and suitability of the smart camera for the estimation of remote underwater fish metrics.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) for health has a great potential; it has already proven to be successful in enhancing patient outcomes, facilitating professional work and benefiting administration.

Currently there are several therapeutic options available; however these are only suitable for limited subpopulation: surgical resection or radiosurgery for cases with a limited number of lesions, targeted therapies for approximately 18% of patients, and immune checkpoint inhibitors with a response rate of 20-30%. Thus, there is a pressing need for development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic options. This overview article aims to provide research advances in disease model, targeted therapy, blood brain barrier (BBB) opening strategies, imaging and its incorporation with artificial intelligence, external radiotherapy, and internal targeted radionuclide theragnostics. Finally, a distinct type of BM, leptomeningeal metastasis is also covered.", "Cardiac CT has been proven to provide diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of coronary artery disease for cardiovascular risk stratification and treatment decision-making based on rapid technological development and various research evidence. Coronary CT angiography has emerged as a gateway test for coronary artery disease that can reduce invasive angiography due to its high negative predictive value, but the diagnostic specificity is relatively low. However, coronary CT angiography is likely to overcome its limitations through functional evaluation to identify the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery disease by analyzing myocardial perfusion and fractional flow reserve through cardiac CT. Recently, studies have been actively conducted to incorporate artificial intelligence to make this more objective and reproducible.

We performed external validation on a U.S. screening cohort of a mammography-derived AI breast cancer risk model originally developed for European screening cohorts. We retrospectively identified 176 breast cancers with exams 3 months to 2 years prior to cancer diagnosis and a random sample of 4963 controls from women with at least one-year negative follow-up. A risk score for each woman was calculated via the AI risk model. Age-adjusted areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) were estimated for the entire cohort and separately for White and Black women. The Gail 5-year risk model was also evaluated for comparison. The overall AUC was 0.68 (95% CIs 0.64\u22120.72) for all women, 0.67 (0.61\u22120.72) for White women, and 0.70 (0.65\u22120.76) for Black women. The AI risk model significantly outperformed the Gail risk model for all women p < 0.01 and for Black women p < 0.01, but not for White women p = 0.38. The performance of the mammography-derived AI risk model was comparable to previously reported European validation results; non-significantly different when comparing White and Black women; and overall, significantly higher than that of the Gail model.", "Metasurfaces are promising platforms for integrated compact optical systems. Traditional metasurface holography design algorithms are limited to information capacity due to finite spatial bandwidth production, which is insufficient for the growing demand for big data storage and encryption. Here, we propose and demonstrate deep learning empowered ultra-dense complex-amplitude holography using step-moving cascaded metasurfaces. Using deep learning artificial intelligence optimization strategy, the barriers of traditional algorithms can be conquered to meet diverse practical requirements. Two metasurfaces are cascaded to form the desired holography. One of them can move to switch the reconstruction images due to diffraction propagation accumulated during the cascaded path. The diffraction pattern from the first metasurface propagates at a different distance and meets with the second metasurface, reconstructing the target holographic reconstructions in the far-field. Such a technique can provide a new solution for multi-dimensional beam shaping, optical encryption, camouflage, integrated on-chip ultra-high-density storage, etc.", "Despite a century of use in assessing children for predicting academic success, IQ theory and assessments largely overlook the intellectual repertoires of adolescents and adults that are not common, including declarative, procedural, and tacit knowledge. Such knowledge and skill repertoires are essential elements of adult intellectual life and livelihood. A proposal for considering a wider range of knowledge and skills in the definition and assessment of intelligence is offered, along with ideas for moving forward in both research and applications. When intelligence is considered beyond the lowest common denominator, it is clear that there are many important questions have yet to be answered about adolescent and adult intellectual development, maintenance, and decline, occupational performance, relations between intelligence and nonability traits, and the role of engagement in day-to-day intellectual functioning. The proposed focus is to reconsider what it means to be an intelligent adult beyond the IQ measures and to recognize that adults, on average, are far more \"intelligent\" than they have been considered to be by traditional IQ assessments developed over the last century.

Recent advances in endoscopic techniques have progressively added new tools to the armamentarium of endoscopists for a deeper assessment and characterisation of the intestinal mucosa. Virtual Electronic chromoendoscopy is widely available in the endoscopic units, leading to a more accurate evaluation of the vascular and mucosal architecture of the colon, reducing the gap with histology, which is considered a favourable long-term measure. In addition, advanced, sophisticated techniques such as endocytoscope and confocal laser endomicroscopy provide insights into individualised and personalised IBD therapy. Finally, high expectations are placed on the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with promising applications that have the potential to revolutionise IBD diagnosis and management. Here, we discuss state-of-the-art of endoscopic techniques and their applicability to accurate assess endoscopic and histological remission, predict response to therapy and detect, characterise and guide treatment of colonic dysplastic lesions. We are seeing the dawn of a new era wherein the applications of these new endoscopic tools, hand in hand with AI, offer the most incredible opportunity to deliver precision medicine to patients with IBD.", "Integrating neurons into digital systems may enable performance infeasible with silicon alone. Here, we develop DishBrain, a system that harnesses the inherent adaptive computation of neurons in a structured environment. In\u00a0vitro neural networks from human or rodent origins are integrated with in silico computing via a high-density multielectrode array. Through electrophysiological stimulation and recording, cultures are embedded in a simulated game-world, mimicking the arcade game \"Pong.\" Applying implications from the theory of active inference via the free energy principle, we find apparent learning within five minutes of real-time gameplay not observed in control conditions. Further experiments demonstrate the importance of closed-loop structured feedback in eliciting learning over time. Cultures display the ability to self-organize activity in a goal-directed manner in response to sparse sensory information about the consequences of their actions, which we term synthetic biological intelligence. Future applications may provide further insights into the cellular correlates of intelligence.", "This study investigated the effect of Mahjong, which is a table game played by three or four players and involves intellectual activity, on the intelligence quotient (IQ) of children. The participants were children between the age of 6 and 15 years, and their IQ was assessed immediately after enrolling in children's Mahjong classes and 1 year after the enrollment using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Fourth Edition (WISC-IV). Twenty children were included in the analysis. Their mean age at the time of the initial evaluation was 9 years and 6 months. In addition, we conducted a 1-year post-examination. The change in the IQ of this group was compared to that of a historical control group with a similar age range and test-retest interval. The mean overall full-scale IQ of the 20 children during the initial and post-1-year examinations was 106.05 and 113.75, respectively, and showed a statistically significant increase (p < 0.01). Based on the subscale index, the verbal comprehension index (VCI) and processing speed index (PSI) scores both showed a statistically significant increase from 100.6 to 106.75 and from 108.05 to 119.05 (p < 0.01), respectively. The PSI of the children included in the analysis showed a statistically significant increase compared to the historical control group. This study suggests that children who participate in Mahjong classes during their childhood have increased PSI scores of WISC-IV.", "Kidney cancer is a very dangerous and lethal cancerous disease caused by kidney tumors or by genetic renal disease, and very few patients survive because there is no method for early prediction of kidney cancer. Early prediction of kidney cancer helps doctors start proper therapy and treatment for the patients, preventing kidney tumors and renal transplantation. With the adaptation of artificial intelligence, automated tools empowered with different deep learning and machine learning algorithms can predict cancers. In this study, the proposed model used the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based transfer learning technique with different deep learning algorithms to predict kidney cancer in its early stages, and for the patient's data security, the proposed model incorporates blockchain technology-based private clouds and transfer-learning trained models. To predict kidney cancer, the proposed model used biopsies of cancerous kidneys consisting of three classes. The proposed model achieved the highest training accuracy and prediction accuracy of 99.8% and 99.20%, respectively, empowered with data augmentation and without augmentation, and the proposed model achieved 93.75% prediction accuracy during validation. Transfer learning provides a promising framework with the combination of IoMT technologies and blockchain technology layers to enhance the diagnosing capabilities of kidney cancer.", "Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) and has been utilized in clinical research and practice to construct high-performing prediction models. Hidden blood loss (HBL) is prevalent during the perioperative period of spinal treatment and might result in a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to develop a ML-based model for identifying perioperative HBL-related risk factors in patients with thoracolumbar burst fracture (TBF).\nIn this study, single-central TBF patients were chosen. The medical information on patients, including clinical characteristics, laboratory indicators, and surgery-related parameters, was extracted. After comparing various ML model algorithms, we selected the best model with high performance. The model was validated using the internal validation set before performing recursive feature elimination (RFE) to determine the importance of HBL-related risk factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, accuracy (ACC), sensitivity, and specificity were reported as critical model measures for evaluating predictive performance.\nIn this study, 62 (38.5%) of the 161 TBF patients were positive for HBL. There was a significant statistical difference in age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, Beta (percentage of vertebral restoration), duration of operation, and other pre-operative laboratory indicators between the HBL-positive and HBL-negative groups. Nine ML-based models were built and validated, with the Random Forest model having the greatest AUC in both the training set (0.905) and internal validation set (0.864). Furthermore, following RFE, age, duration of operation, Beta, pre-operative fibrinogen (Fib), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were identified as the five main important risk factors in patients with TBF during the perioperative period.\nIn this study, we built and validated ML algorithms for an individualized prediction of HBL-related risk factors in the perioperative period of TBF. The importance of HBL-related risk factors could be determined, which contributes to clinicians' decision-making and improves perioperative management.", "Currently, one of the topical areas of application of artificial intelligence methods in industrial production is neural networks, which allow for predicting the performance properties of products and structures that depend on the characteristics of the initial components and process parameters. The purpose of the study was to develop and train a neural network and an ensemble model to predict the mechanical properties of lightweight fiber-reinforced concrete using the accumulated empirical database and data from construction industry enterprises, and to improve production processes in the construction industry. The study applied deep learning and an ensemble of regression trees. The empirical base is the result of testing a series of experimental compositions of fiber-reinforced concrete. The predicted properties are cubic compressive strength, prismatic compressive strength, flexural tensile strength, and axial tensile strength. The quantitative picture of the accuracy of the applied methods for strength characteristics varies for the deep neural network method from 0.15 to 0.73 (MAE), from 0.17 to 0.89 (RMSE), and from 0.98% to 6.62% (MAPE), and for the ensemble of regression trees, from 0.11 to 0.62 (MAE), from 0.15 to 0.80 (RMSE), and from 1.30% to 3.4% (MAPE). Both methods have shown high efficiency in relation to such a hard-to-predict material as concrete, which is so heterogeneous in structure and depends on many factors. The value of the developed models lies in the possibility of obtaining additional useful information in the process of preparing highly functional lightweight fiber-reinforced concrete without additional experiments.", "The article discusses an approach to the construction and operation of a proactive system for protecting smart power grids against cyberattacks on service data transfer protocols. It is based on a combination of computational intelligence methods: identifying anomalies in network traffic by evaluating its self-similarity, detecting and classifying cyberattacks in anomalies, and taking effective protection measures using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells. Fractal analysis, mathematical statistics, and neural networks with long short-term memory are used as tools in the development of this protection system. The issues of software implementation of the proposed system and the formation of a data set containing network packets of a smart grid system are considered. The experimental results obtained using the generated data set demonstrated and confirmed the high efficiency of the proposed proactive smart grid protection system in detecting cyberattacks in real or near real-time, as well as in predicting the impact of cyberattacks and developing efficient measures to counter them.", "The Internet of Things applications have become popular because of their lightweight nature and usefulness, which require low latency and response time. Hence, Internet of Things applications are deployed with the fog management layer (software) in closely located edge servers (hardware) as per the requirements. Due to their lightweight properties, Internet of Things applications do not consume many computing resources. Therefore, it is common that a small-scale data center can accommodate thousands of Internet of Things applications. However, in small-scale fog computing environments, task scheduling of applications is limited to offering low latency and response times. In this paper, we propose a latency-aware task scheduling method for Internet of Things applications based on artificial intelligence in small-scale fog computing environments. The core concept of the proposed task scheduling is to use artificial neural networks with partitioning capabilities. With the partitioning technique for artificial neural networks, multiple edge servers are able to learn and calculate hyperparameters in parallel, which reduces scheduling times and service level objectives. Performance evaluation with state-of-the-art studies shows the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed task scheduling in small-scale fog computing environments while introducing negligible energy consumption.", "In a smart city environment, with increased demand for energy efficiency, information exchange and communication through wireless sensor networks (WSNs) plays an important role. In WSNs, the sensors are usually operating in clusters, and they are allowed to restructure for effective communication over a large area and for a long time. In this scenario, load-balanced clustering is the cost-effective means of improving the system performance. Although clustering is a discrete problem, the computational intelligence techniques are more suitable for load balancing and minimizing energy consumption with different operating constraints. The literature reveals that the swarm intelligence-inspired computational approaches give excellent results among population-based meta-heuristic approaches because of their more remarkable exploration ability. Conversely, in this work, load-balanced clustering for sustainable WSNs is presented using improved gray wolf optimization (IGWO). In a smart city environment, the significant parameters of energy-efficient load-balanced clustering involve the network lifetime, dead cluster heads, dead gateways, dead sensor nodes, and energy consumption while ensuring information exchange and communication among the sensors and cluster heads. Therefore, based on the above parameters, the proposed IGWO is compared with the existing GWO and several other techniques. Moreover, the convergence characteristics of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated for an extensive network in a smart city environment, which consists of 500 sensors and 50 cluster heads deployed in an area of 500 \u00d7 500 m2, and it was found to be significantly improved.", "This work presents an artificial intelligence enhanced orbital angular momentum (OAM) data transmission system. This system enables encoded data retrieval from speckle patterns generated by an incident beam carrying different topological charges (TCs) at the distal end of a multi-mode fiber. An appropriately trained network is shown to support up to 100 different fractional TCs in parallel with TC intervals as small as 0.01, thus overcoming the problems with previous methods that only supported a few modes and could not use small TC intervals. Additionally, an approach using multiple parallel neural networks is proposed that can increase the system's channel capacity without increasing individual network complexity. When compared with a single network, multiple parallel networks can achieve the better performance with reduced training data requirements, which is beneficial in saving computational capacity while also expanding the network bandwidth. Finally, we demonstrate high-fidelity image transmission using a 16-bit system and four parallel 14-bit systems via OAM mode multiplexing through a 1-km-long commercial multi-mode fiber (MMF).", "Current chemical methods used to control plant diseases cause a negative impact on the environment and increase production costs. Accurate and early detection is vital for designing effective protection strategies for crops. We evaluate advanced distributed edge intelligence techniques with distinct learning principles for early black sigatoka disease detection using hyperspectral imaging. We discuss the learning features of the techniques used, which will help researchers improve their understanding of the required data conditions and identify a method suitable for their research needs. A set of hyperspectral images of banana leaves inoculated with a conidial suspension of black sigatoka fungus (Pseudocercospora fijiensis) was used to train and validate machine learning models. Support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), neural networks, N-way partial least square-discriminant analysis (NPLS-DA), and partial least square-penalized logistic regression (PLS-PLR) were selected due to their high predictive power. The metrics of AUC, precision, sensitivity, prediction, and F1 were used for the models' evaluation. The experimental results show that the PLS-PLR, SVM, and MLP models allow for the successful detection of black sigatoka disease with high accuracy, which positions them as robust and highly reliable HSI classification methods for the early detection of plant disease and can be used to assess chemical and biological control of phytopathogens.", "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved high levels of accuracy in the diagnosis of various diseases, its impact on physicians' decision-making performance in clinical practice is uncertain. This study aims to assess the impact of AI on the diagnostic performance of physicians with differing levels of self-efficacy under working conditions involving different time pressures.\nA 2 (independent diagnosis vs AI-assisted diagnosis) \u00d7 2 (no time pressure vs 2-minute time limit) randomized controlled experiment of multicenter physicians was conducted. Participants diagnosed 10 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cases and their diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were evaluated. Data analysis was performed using multilevel logistic regression.\nOne hundred and four radiologists from 102 hospitals completed the experiment. The results reveal (1) AI greatly increases physicians' diagnostic accuracy, either with or without time pressure; (2) when no time pressure, AI significantly improves physicians' diagnostic sensitivity but no significant change in specificity, while under time pressure, physicians' diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are both improved with the aid of AI; (3) when no time pressure, physicians with low self-efficacy benefit from AI assistance thus improving diagnostic accuracy but those with high self-efficacy do not, whereas physicians with low and high levels of self-efficacy both benefit from AI under time pressure.\nThis study is one of the first to provide real-world evidence regarding the impact of AI on physicians' decision-making performance, taking into account 2 boundary factors: clinical time pressure and physicians' self-efficacy.\nAI-assisted diagnosis should be prioritized for physicians working under time pressure or with low self-efficacy.", "c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) is currently considered a critical therapeutic target for type-2 diabetes. In recent years, there has been a great interest in naturopathic molecules, and the discovery of active ingredients from natural products for specific targets has received increasing attention. Based on the above background, this research aims to combine emerging Artificial Intelligence technologies with traditional Computer-Aided Drug Design methods to find natural products with JNK1 inhibitory activity. First, we constructed three machine learning models (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network) and performed model fusion based on Voting and Stacking strategies. The integrated models with better performance (AUC of 0.906 and 0.908, respectively) were then employed for the virtual screening of 4112 natural products in the ZINC database. After further drug-likeness filtering, we calculated the binding free energy of 22 screened compounds using molecular docking and performed a consensus analysis of the two methodologies. Subsequently, we identified the three most promising candidates (Lariciresinol, Tricin, and 4'-Demethylepipodophyllotoxin) according to the obtained probability values and relevant reports, while their binding characteristics were preliminarily explored by molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we performed in vitro biological validation of these three compounds, and the results showed that Tricin exhibited an acceptable inhibitory activity against JNK1 (IC50 = 17.68 \u03bcM). This natural product can be used as a template molecule for the design of novel JNK1 inhibitors.", "Vital signs have been widely adopted in in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) assessment, which plays an important role in inpatient deterioration detection. As the number of early warning systems and artificial intelligence applications increases, health care information exchange and interoperability are becoming more complex and difficult. Although Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) have already developed a vital signs profile, it is not sufficient to support IHCA applications or machine learning-based models.\nIn this paper, for IHCA instances with vital signs, we define a new implementation guide that includes data mapping, a system architecture, a workflow, and FHIR applications.\nWe interviewed 10 experts regarding health care system integration and defined an implementation guide. We then developed the FHIR Extract Transform Load to map data to FHIR resources. We also integrated an early warning system and machine learning pipeline.\nThe study data set includes electronic health records of adult inpatients who visited the En-Chu-Kong hospital. Medical staff regularly measured these vital signs at least 2 to 3 times per day during the day, night, and early morning. We used pseudonymization to protect patient privacy. Then, we converted the vital signs to FHIR observations in the JSON format using the FHIR Extract Transform Load application. The measured vital signs include systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. According to clinical requirements, we also extracted the electronic health record information to the FHIR server. Finally, we integrated an early warning system and machine learning pipeline using the FHIR RESTful application programming interface.\nWe successfully demonstrated a process that standardizes health care information for inpatient deterioration detection using vital signs. Based on the FHIR definition, we also provided an implementation guide that includes data mapping, an integration process, and IHCA assessment using vital signs. We also proposed a clarifying system architecture and possible workflows. Based on FHIR, we integrated the 3 different systems in 1 dashboard system, which can effectively solve the complexity of the system in the medical staff workflow.", "Faculty development is a poorly understood and incompletely executed initiative in undergraduate and graduate medical and dental education programs. Despite significant change in the delivery of health care over the past several decades, the education of students and residents has followed a legacy path of business as usual. Some faculty have incorrectly assumed that content expertise transfers to teaching expertise. The insistence for robust faculty development programs on the part of accrediting and other professional organizations has created a call to action, but much work has yet to be done. It is therefore essential that leaders in these programs develop a sense of urgency to teach the teachers lest our students and residents will replicate outdated methods, unsystematically teach themselves, and fall victim to an educational system that is grossly inadequate. It is the purpose of this article to enhance undergraduate and graduate medical and dental education by offering viable change options, specifically targeted to improving historical trends by emphasizing the importance of growth mindsets, emotional intelligence, the creation of holding environments, and stimulating enthusiasm for lifelong learning as part of twenty-first century strategies for faculty development.", "The segmentation of medical and dental images is a fundamental step in automated clinical decision support systems. It supports the entire clinical workflow from diagnosis, therapy planning, intervention, and follow-up. In this paper, we propose a novel tool to accurately process a full-face segmentation in about 5 minutes that would otherwise require an average of 7h of manual work by experienced clinicians. This work focuses on the integration of the state-of-the-art UNEt TRansformers (UNETR) of the Medical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence (MONAI) framework. We trained and tested our models using 618 de-identified Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) volumetric images of the head acquired with several parameters from different centers for a generalized clinical application. Our results on a 5-fold cross-validation showed high accuracy and robustness with a Dice score up to 0.962\u00b10.02. Our code is available on our public GitHub repository.", "Background: Intraoperative hypotension is common in patients having non-cardiac surgery and associated with postoperative acute myocardial injury, acute kidney injury, and mortality. Avoiding intraoperative hypotension is a complex task for anesthesiologists. Using artificial intelligence to predict hypotension from clinical and hemodynamic data is an innovative and intriguing approach. The AcumenTM Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) software (Edwards Lifesciences; Irvine, CA, USA) was developed using artificial intelligence\u2014specifically machine learning\u2014and predicts hypotension from blood pressure waveform features. We aimed to describe the incidence, duration, severity, and causes of intraoperative hypotension when using HPI monitoring in patients having elective major non-cardiac surgery. Methods: We built up a European, multicenter, prospective, observational registry including at least 700 evaluable patients from five European countries. The registry includes consenting adults (\u226518 years) who were scheduled for elective major non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia that was expected to last at least 120 min and in whom arterial catheter placement and HPI monitoring was planned. The major objectives are to quantify and characterize intraoperative hypotension (defined as a mean arterial pressure [MAP] < 65 mmHg) when using HPI monitoring. This includes the time-weighted average (TWA) MAP < 65 mmHg, area under a MAP of 65 mmHg, the number of episodes of a MAP < 65 mmHg, the proportion of patients with at least one episode (1 min or more) of a MAP < 65 mmHg, and the absolute maximum decrease below a MAP of 65 mmHg. In addition, we will assess causes of intraoperative hypotension and investigate associations between intraoperative hypotension and postoperative outcomes. Discussion: There are only sparse data on the effect of using HPI monitoring on intraoperative hypotension in patients having elective major non-cardiac surgery. Therefore, we built up a European, multicenter, prospective, observational registry to describe the incidence, duration, severity, and causes of intraoperative hypotension when using HPI monitoring in patients having elective major non-cardiac surgery.", "Rapid, non-destructive, and smart assessment of the maturity levels of fruit facilitates their harvesting and handling operations throughout the supply chain. Recent studies have introduced machine vision systems as a promising candidate for non-destructive evaluations of the ripeness levels of various agricultural and forest products. However, the reported models have been fruit-specific and cannot be applied to other fruit. In this regard, the current study aims to evaluate the feasibility of estimating the ripeness levels of wild pistachio fruit using image processing and artificial intelligence techniques. Images of wild pistachios at four ripeness levels were recorded using a digital camera, and 285 color and texture features were extracted from 160 samples. Using the quadratic sequential feature selection method, 16 efficient features were identified and used to estimate the maturity levels of samples. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and an artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to classify samples into four ripeness levels, including initial unripe, secondary unripe, ripe, and overripe. The developed machine vision system achieved a correct classification rate (CCR) of 93.75, 97.5, and 100%, respectively. The high accuracy of the developed models confirms the capability of the low-cost visible imaging system in assessing the ripeness of wild pistachios in a non-destructive, automated, and rapid manner.", "Recently, Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a revolutionary field, providing a great opportunity in shaping modern crop breeding, and is extensively used indoors for plant science. Advances in crop phenomics, enviromics, together with the other \"omics\" approaches are paving ways for elucidating the detailed complex biological mechanisms that motivate crop functions in response to environmental trepidations. These \"omics\" approaches have provided plant researchers with precise tools to evaluate the important agronomic traits for larger-sized germplasm at a reduced time interval in the early growth stages. However, the big data and the complex relationships within impede the understanding of the complex mechanisms behind genes driving the agronomic-trait formations. AI brings huge computational power and many new tools and strategies for future breeding. The present review will encompass how applications of AI technology, utilized for current breeding practice, assist to solve the problem in high-throughput phenotyping and gene functional analysis, and how advances in AI technologies bring new opportunities for future breeding, to make envirotyping data widely utilized in breeding. Furthermore, in the current breeding methods, linking genotype to phenotype remains a massive challenge and impedes the optimal application of high-throughput field phenotyping, genomics, and enviromics. In this review, we elaborate on how AI will be the preferred tool to increase the accuracy in high-throughput crop phenotyping, genotyping, and envirotyping data; moreover, we explore the developing approaches and challenges for multiomics big computing data integration. Therefore, the integration of AI with \"omics\" tools can allow rapid gene identification and eventually accelerate crop-improvement programs.", "With the development of industrial manufacturing intelligence, the role of rotating machinery in industrial production and life is more and more important. Aiming at the problems of the complex and changeable working environment of rolling bearings and limited computing ability, fault feature information cannot be effectively extracted, and the current deep learning model is difficult to be compatible with lightweight and high efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a fault detection method for power equipment based on an energy spectrum diagram and deep learning. Firstly, a novel two-dimensional time-frequency feature representation method and energy spectrum feature map based on wavelet packet transform is proposed, and an energy spectrum feature map dataset is made for subsequent diagnosis. This method can realize multi-resolution analysis, fully extract the feature information contained in the fault signal, and accelerate the convergence of the subsequent diagnosis model. Secondly, a lightweight residual dense convolutional neural network model (LR-DenseNet) is proposed. This model combines the advantages of residual learning and a dense connection, and can not only extract deep features more easily, but can also effectively use shallow features. Then, based on the lightweight residual dense convolutional neural network model, an LR-DenseSENet model is proposed. By introducing the transfer learning strategy and adding the channel domain, an attention mechanism is added to the channel feature fusion layer, with the accuracy of detection up to 99.4%, and the amount of parameter calculation greatly reduced to one-fifth of that of VGG. Finally, through an experimental analysis, it is verified that the fault detection model designed in this paper based on the combination of an energy spectrum feature map and LR-DenseSENet achieves a satisfactory detection effect.", "To analyze the concept of patient voice and discuss implications for clinical care of individuals with metastatic cancer.\nThe diagnosis of metastatic cancer requires increased patient support and healthcare resource utilization. The patient voice should be heard and incorporated into care planning to improve the overall experience of individual with metastatic cancer.\nConcept analysis.\nDictionary definitions and scientific literature from electronic databases, including PubMed.\nUsing Walker and Avant's method of concept analysis, we identified attributes, antecedents, and consequences.\nPatient voice is defined as verbal or written communication by the patient to their healthcare partner to positively influence their quantity and quality of life. Attributes of patient voice include context, healthcare partner, safety, time, active listening, communication, and incorporation. Antecedents to patient voice include patient, baseline knowledge, continuing education, medical system culture, and emotional intelligence, and consequences include improved quality of life, adherence to treatment plan, overall satisfaction, and sense of control. Every instance of patient voice prepares the individual for future experiences that can positively impact their care.\nThe concept of patient voice is vital to integrate into care to ensure individual's wishes and goals are incorporated in advanced disease populations. Systematically incorporating the patient voice into the care of individuals with metastatic cancer will allow patients to experience treatment and the progression to end-of-life care according to their preferences.", "There is an increasing need to integrate patient-generated health data (PGHD) into health information systems (HISs). The use of health information standards based on the dual model allows the achievement of semantic interoperability among systems. Although there is evidence in the use of the Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (SMART on FHIR) framework for standardized communication between mobile apps and electronic health records (EHRs), the use of European Norm/International Organization for Standardization (EN/ISO) 13606 has not been explored yet, despite some advantages over FHIR in terms of modeling and formalization of clinical knowledge, as well as flexibility in the creation of new concepts.\nThis study aims to design and implement a methodology based on the dual-model paradigm to communicate clinical information between a patient mobile app (Xemio Research) and an institutional ontology-based clinical repository (OntoCR) without loss of meaning.\nThis paper is framed within Artificial intelligence Supporting CAncer Patients across Europe (ASCAPE), a project that aims to use artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) mechanisms to support cancer patients' health status and quality of life (QoL). First, the variables \"side effect\" and \"daily steps\" were defined and represented with EN/ISO 13606 archetypes. Next, ontologies that model archetyped concepts and map them to the standard were created and uploaded to OntoCR, where they were ready to receive instantiated patient data. Xemio Research used a conversion module in the ASCAPE Local Edge to transform data entered into the app to create EN/ISO 13606 extracts, which were sent to an Application Programming Interface (API) in OntoCR that maps each element in the normalized XML files to its corresponding location in the ontology. This way, instantiated data of patients are stored in the clinical repository.\nBetween December 22, 2020, and April 4, 2022, 1100 extracts of 47 patients were successfully communicated (234/1100, 21.3%, extracts of side effects and 866/1100, 78.7%, extracts of daily activity). Furthermore, the creation of EN/ISO 13606-standardized archetypes allows the reuse of clinical information regarding daily activity and side effects, while with the creation of ontologies, we extended the knowledge representation of our clinical repository.\nHealth information interoperability is one of the requirements for continuity of health care. The dual model allows the separation of knowledge and information in HISs. EN/ISO 13606 was chosen for this project because of the operational mechanisms it offers for data exchange, as well as its flexibility for modeling knowledge and creating new concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experience reported in the literature of effective communication of EN/ISO 13606 EHR extracts between a patient mobile app and an institutional clinical repository using a scalable standard-agnostic methodology that can be applied to other projects, data sources, and institutions.", "Understanding the emotional profile of students during their training, as well as associated psychosocial factors such as optimism versus pessimism and self-esteem, is critical to improving student performance, especially in the post-pandemic period. In this study, 798 university students participated, belonging to the Degrees of Early Childhood and Primary Education, with a mean age of 24.52 years (\u00b15.48). The following instruments were used: Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS-S), Life Orientation Test Revised (LOT-R) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). The objective was to determine the predictive value of self-esteem on emotional intelligence and optimism vs. pessimism. A positive relationship between several dimensions of the instruments used (p < 0.01) were found. Moreover, the regression model predicted an association between emotional intelligence (use of emotions), pessimism and self-esteem. The practical consequences suggest the importance of the acquisition of emotional competences by university students is essential to obtain higher performances.", "The high level of expertise required for accurate interpretation of prostate MRI.\nTo develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI) system for diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer (CsPC) with MRI.\nRetrospective.\nOne thousand two hundred thirty patients from derivation cohort between Jan 2012 and Oct 2019, and 169 patients from a publicly available data (U-Net: 423 for training/validation and 49 for test and TrumpeNet: 820 for training/validation and 579 for test).\n3.0T/scanners, T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI), diffusion-weighted imaging, and apparent diffusion coefficient map.\nClose-loop AI system was trained with an Unet for prostate segmentation and a TrumpetNet for CsPC detection.

For external test, both AI (0.86) and subspecialist (0.86) had higher AUC than junior (0.80, P\u2009<\u20090.05) and general reader (0.83, P\u2009<\u20090.05). In individual, it revealed moderate diagnostic heterogeneity in 24 readers (Mantel-Haenszel I2 \u00a0=\u00a056.8%, P\u2009<\u20090.01), and AI outperformed 54.2% (13/24) of readers in summary ROC analysis. In multivariate test, Gleason score, zonal location, PI-RADS score and lesion size significantly impacted the accuracy of AI; while effect of data source, MR device and parameter settings on AI performance is insignificant (P\u2009>\u20090.05).\nOur AI system can match and to some case exceed clinicians for the diagnosis of CsPC with prostate MRI.\n3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.", "Hemodialysis complications remain a critical threat among dialysis patients. They result in sudden termination of the\u00a0session which impacts the efficiency of dialysis. As intra-dialytic complications are the result of the interplay of multiple factors, artificial intelligence can aid in their early prediction. This research aims to compare different machine learning tools for the early prediction of the most frequent hemodialysis complications with high performance, using the fewest predictors for easier practical implementation.\nFifty different variables were recorded during 6000 hemodialysis sessions performed in a regional dialysis unit in Egypt. The filter technique was used to extract the most relevant features. Then, five individual classifiers and three ensemble approaches were implemented to predict the occurrence of intra-dialytic complications. Different subsets of 25, 12 and 6 from the 50 collected features were tested.\nRandom forest yielded the highest accuracy of 98% with the least training time using 12 features in a balanced dataset, while the gradient boosting allowed obtaining the highest F1-score of 94%, 92%, and 78% in the prediction of hypotension, hypertension, and dyspnea, respectively, in imbalanced datasets.\nApplying different machine learning algorithms to big datasets can improve accuracy, reduce training time and model complexity allowing simple implementation in clinical practice. Our models can help nephrologists predict and possibly prevent dialysis complications.", "Due to factors such as medical resources, public awareness, funding for general screening, or optimized screening models, community-based screening is far from meeting the demand. Artificial intelligence (AI) can replace some of the medical work and combine it with the \"Internet+\" model to transfer medical resources to improve accessibility and availability. However, the application of AI technology to community-based screening still faces many challenges, such as most AI products cannot be directly applied to community-based screening, the inability to integrate multimodal information such as medical history, symptoms, and images, and the lack of relevant regulations and health policies for productization and implementation. Therefore, we suggest that the relevant departments take actions: (1) to build standardized big data sets, unlock data barriers, and accelerate the development and application of AI technology; (2) to train \"AI+\" medical staffs as soon as possible; (3) to establish relevant laws and regulations; (4) to establish relevant R&D plans and quality standards and regulatory frameworks for AI products; (5) to encourage more investment in medical AI infrastructure in the central and western regions and remote and poor areas.\n\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u57fa\u5c42\u773c\u5065\u5eb7\u670d\u52a1\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u7fa4\u4f17\u9884\u9632\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u666e\u7b5b\u7ecf\u8d39\u3001\u7b5b\u67e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6211\u56fd\u793e\u533a\u4eba\u7fa4\u773c\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\u4f9b\u7ed9\u8fdc\u8fdc\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u90e8\u5206\u533b\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u201c\u4e92\u8054\u7f51+\u201d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c06\u4f18\u52bf\u533b\u7597\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u6c89\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u773c\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\u4f9b\u9700\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u4f46AI\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u793e\u533a\u773c\u75c5\u7b5b\u67e5\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u5927\u90e8\u5206AI\u4ea7\u54c1\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u793e\u533a\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u75c5\u53f2\u3001\u75c7\u72b6\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u6574\u5408\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4ea7\u54c1\u5316\u548c\u843d\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u536b\u751f\u653f\u7b56\u7b49\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u5efa\u8bae\u7531\u76f8\u5173\u90e8\u95e8\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u771f\u6b63\u6253\u7834\u6570\u636e\u58c1\u5792\uff0c\u52a0\u901fAI\u6280\u672f\u7814\u53d1\u548c\u843d\u5730\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u5c3d\u5feb\u57f9\u517b\u201cAI+\u201d\u590d\u5408\u578b\u533b\u7597\u4eba\u624d\uff1b\u5c3d\u5feb\u5b8c\u5584\u76f8\u5173\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6cd5\u89c4\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5065\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u79d1\u7814\u53d1\u5c55\u89c4\u5212\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u9700\u6c42\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u4e2d\u897f\u90e8\u5730\u533a\u548c\u8fb9\u8fdc\u8d2b\u56f0\u5730\u533a\u52a0\u5927\u533b\u5b66AI\u57fa\u5efa\u6295\u5165\u3002.", "A project manager's emotional intelligence (EI) is essential to project success. However, the mechanism in this cause and effect remains a black box in extant literature. China is now the world's largest construction market, and figuring out the mechanism of construction project manager's (CPM's) EI on project success is meaningful for developing the global construction market. This study conducted an in-depth interview with 24 CPMs with more than 5-year experience in construction project management. The grounded theory was employed to profile the application of CPM's EI and to build the multilevel mechanism that explains the influence of CPM's EI on project success. The mechanism framework conforms to the existed input-process-output (IPO) theory. It consists of a team-level mechanism (including the positive team atmosphere, shared vision, and team cohesion) and an individual-level mechanism (i.e., organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization, perceived supervisor support, trust in leader, and subordinate's psychological and emotional health). This study further proposed that the effect of this mechanism does not work immediately but develops with time passing. Implications for further research and project management practice are discussed in the end.", "Gunao-Yizhi decoction has the effects of supplementing intelligence, strengthening marrow, resolving phlegm, and reducing turbidity. It is clinically used for the treatment of vascular dementia (VaD). However, there is still a lack of systematic evaluation of its efficacy and safety. This review conducted a systematic review of the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of Gunao-Yizhi decoction combined with donepezil for VaD.\nChina National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database (Wanfang), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials on Gunao-Yizhi decoction combined with donepezil for VaD. RevMan 5.3 software was used for data analysis.\nTwelve studies were obtained, including 1036 patients. Compared with donepezil alone, meta-analysis showed that Gunao-Yizhi decoction combined with donepezil could improve clinical efficacy, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, Hasegawa dementia scale (HDS), increase the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in serum, and reduce the level of malonaldehyde dismutas (MDA) in serum. The GRADE system was adopted to evaluate the outcome index. Clinical efficiency and the MMSE score were evaluated as very-low-quality evidence. HDS score, serum SOD level, and serum MDA level were evaluated as low-quality evidence.\nGunao-Yizhi decoction combined with donepezil has a significant prevalence in the treatment of vascular dementia, with no increase in adverse events. Gunao-Yizhi decoction can be recommended for routine use in the treatment of VaD.", "Monkeypox is a possible public health concern that requires appropriate attention in order to prevent the spread of the disease. Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) is making a significant impact on precision medicine, reshaping and integrating the large amount of data derived from multiomics analyses and revolutionizing the deep-learning strategies. There has been a significant progress in the use of AI to detect, screen, diagnose, and classify diseases, characterize virus genomes, assess biomarkers for prognostic and predictive purposes, and develop follow-up strategies. Hence, it is possible to use AI for the identification of disease clusters, cases monitoring, forecasting the future outbreak, determining mortality risk, diagnosing, managing, and identifying patterns for studying disease trends. AI may also be utilized to assist gene therapy and other therapies that we are not currently able to use in healthcare. It is possible to combine pharmacology and gene therapy with regenerative medicine with the help of AI. It will directly benefit the public in overcoming fear and panic of health risks. Therefore, AI can be an effective weapon to fight against Monkeypox infection, and may prove to be an invaluable future tool in improving the clinical management of patients. Key Points: Emergence and spread of the Monkeypox virus is a new public health crisis; threatening the world. This opinion piece highlights the urgently required information for immediate delivery of solutions on controlling and monitoring the spread of Monkeypox infection through Artificial IntelligenceCommunicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.", "Research from different sources supports a link between nutrition and neurodevelopment, but evidence is still sparse regarding the relationship between a posteriori dietary patterns (DPs) and cognitive performance in school-aged children. Within the Northern Adriatic Cohort II, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy, 379 7-year-old children were cross-sectionally evaluated. Dietary patterns were identified through a principal component factor analysis based on 37 nutrients from children's 3-day dietary records. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale of Children (WISC-IV) test provided measures of cognitive performance, including the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) and single index scores. Each DP was related to FSIQ or single index scores through multiple robust linear regression models. We identified five DPs named \"Dairy Products\", \"Plant-based Foods\", \"Fats\", \"Meat and Potatoes\", and \"Seafood\" (63% of variance explained). After adjustment, no significant relationship was observed with the FSIQ score; positive associations were found between the \"Seafood\" DP and Verbal Comprehension Index or Perceptual Reasoning Index. The \"Meat and Potatoes\" and \"Dairy Products\" DPs were inversely associated with the Verbal Comprehension Index and Processing Speed Index scores, respectively. In the absence of a relation with the overall FSIQ score, single DPs might influence specific cognitive functions, including verbal and reasoning abilities, as targeted by single indexes, in the expected direction.", "With the rapid development of the economy and productivity, an increasing number of citizens are not only concerned about the nutritional value of algae as a potential new food resource but are also, in particular, paying more attention to the safety of its consumption. Many studies and reports pointed out that analyzing and solving seaweed food safety issues requires holistic and systematic consideration. The three main factors that have been found to affect the food safety of algal are physical, chemical, and microbiological hazards. At the same time, although food safety awareness among food producers and consumers has increased, foodborne diseases caused by algal food safety incidents occur frequently. It threatens the health and lives of consumers and may cause irreversible harm if treatment is not done promptly. A series of studies have also proved the idea that microbial contamination of algae is the main cause of this problem. Therefore, the rapid and efficient detection of toxic and pathogenic microbial contamination in algal products is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed. At the same time, two other factors, such as physical and chemical hazards, cannot be ignored. Nowadays, the detection techniques are mainly focused on three major hazards in traditional methods. However, especially for food microorganisms, the use of traditional microbiological control techniques is time-consuming and has limitations in terms of accuracy. In recent years, these two evaluations of microbial foodborne pathogens monitoring in the farm-to-table chain have shown more importance, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, there are also many new developments in the monitoring of heavy metals, algal toxins, and other pollutants. In the future, algal food safety risk assessment will not only focus on convenient, rapid, low-cost and high-accuracy detection but also be connected with some novel technologies, such as the Internet of Things (artificial intelligence, machine learning), biosensor, and molecular biology, to reach the purpose of simultaneous detection.", "In oncology, the patient state is characterized by a whole spectrum of modalities, ranging from radiology, histology, and genomics to electronic health records. Current artificial intelligence (AI) models operate mainly in the realm of a single modality, neglecting the broader clinical context, which inevitably diminishes their potential. Integration of different data modalities provides opportunities to increase robustness and accuracy of diagnostic and prognostic models, bringing AI closer to clinical practice. AI models are also capable of discovering novel patterns within and across modalities suitable for explaining differences in patient outcomes or treatment resistance. The insights gleaned from such models can guide exploration studies and contribute to the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. To support these advances, here we present a synopsis of AI methods and strategies for multimodal data fusion and association discovery. We outline approaches for AI interpretability and directions for AI-driven exploration through multimodal data interconnections. We examine challenges in clinical adoption and discuss emerging solutions.", "The article aims to outline a contrast between three priorities for nursing management proposed a decade ago and key features of the following 10 years of developments on artificial intelligence for health care and nursing management. This analysis intends to contribute to update the international debate on bridging the essence of health care and nursing management priorities and the focus of artificial intelligence developers.\nArtificial intelligence research promises innovative approaches to supporting nurses' clinical decision-making and to conduct tasks not related to patient interaction, including administrative activities and patient records. Yet, even though there has been an increase in international research and development of artificial intelligence applications for nursing care during the past 10 years, it is unclear to what extent the priorities of nursing management have been embedded in the devised artificial intelligence solutions.\nStarting from three priorities for nursing management identified in 2011 in a special issue of the Journal Nursing Management, we went on to identify recent evidence concerning 10\u2009years of artificial intelligence applications developed to support health care management and nursing activities since then.\nThe article discusses to what extent priorities in health care and nursing management may have to be revised while adopting artificial intelligence applications or, alternatively, to what extent the direction of artificial intelligence developments may need to be revised to contribute to long acknowledged priorities of nursing management.\nWe have identified a conceptual gap between both sets of ideas and provide a discussion on the need to bridge that gap, while admitting that there may have been recent field developments still unreported in scientific literature.\nArtificial intelligence developers and health care nursing managers need to be more engaged in coordinating the future development of artificial intelligence applications with a renewed set of nursing management priorities.", "This study aimed to evaluate the change patterns in corneal intrinsic aberrations and nerve density after cataract surgery in dry eye disease. The preoperative, 1- and 3-month postoperative dry eye-related parameters were obtained by the Oculus keratograph and the ocular surface disease index questionnaire. The corneal intrinsic aberrations were measured using the Pentacam HR system. In vivo confocal microscopy was performed to observe the vortical and peripheral corneal nerves. An artificial intelligence technique run by the deep learning model generated the corneal nerve parameters. Corneal aberrations on the anterior and total corneal surfaces were significantly increased at 1 month compared with the baseline (p < 0.05) but gradually returned to the baseline by 3 months (p > 0.05). However, the change in posterior corneal aberration lasted up to 3 months (p < 0.05). There was a significant decrease in the corneal vortical nerve maximum length and average density after the operation (p < 0.05), and this damage lasted approximately 3 months. The corneal vortical nerve maximum length and average density were negatively correlated with the anterior corneal surface aberrations before and 1 month after the operation (correlation coefficients, CC = \u22120.26, \u22120.25, \u22120.28; all p < 0.05). Corneal vortex provided a unique site to observe long-term corneal nerve injury related to eye dryness. The continuous damage to the corneal vortical nerve may be due to the continuous dry eye state.", "Chest X-ray (CXR) images are considered useful to monitor and investigate a variety of pulmonary disorders such as COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis (TB). With recent technological advancements, such diseases may now be recognized more precisely using computer-assisted diagnostics. Without compromising the classification accuracy and better feature extraction, deep learning (DL) model to predict four different categories is proposed in this study. The proposed model is validated with publicly available datasets of 7132 chest x-ray (CXR) images. Furthermore, results are interpreted and explained using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Local Interpretable Modelagnostic Explanation (LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) for better understandably. Initially, convolution features are extracted to collect high-level object-based information. Next, shapely values from SHAP, predictability results from LIME, and heatmap from Grad-CAM are used to explore the black-box approach of the DL model, achieving average test accuracy of 94.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.01% and validation accuracy of 94.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.33 for 10-fold cross validation. Finally, in order to validate the model and qualify medical risk, medical sensations of classification are taken to consolidate the explanations generated from the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework. The results suggest that XAI and DL models give clinicians/medical professionals persuasive and coherent conclusions related to the detection and categorization of COVID-19, Pneumonia, and TB.", "Recent technological innovations in the field of mass spectrometry have supported the use of metabolomics analysis for precision medicine. This growth has been allowed also by the application of algorithms to data analysis, including multivariate and machine learning methods, which are fundamental to managing large number of variables and samples. In the present review, we reported and discussed the application of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies for metabolomics data analysis. Particularly, we focused on widely used non-linear machine learning classifiers, such as ANN, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. A discussion of recent studies and research focused on disease classification, biomarker identification and early diagnosis is presented. Challenges in the implementation of metabolomics-AI systems, limitations thereof and recent tools were also discussed.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical image diagnosis are often trained and validated on curated data. However, in a clinical setting, images that are outliers with respect to the training data, such as those representing rare disease conditions or acquired using a slightly different setup, can lead to wrong decisions. It is not practical to expect clinicians to be trained to discount results for such outlier images. Toward clinical deployment, we have designed a method to train cautious AI that can automatically flag outlier cases.\nOur method-ClassClust-forms tight clusters of training images using supervised contrastive learning, which helps it identify outliers during testing. We compared ClassClust's ability to detect outliers with three competing methods on four publicly available data sets covering pathology, dermatoscopy, and radiology. We held out certain diseases, artifacts, and types of images from training data and examined the ability of various models to detect these as outliers during testing. We compared the decision accuracy of the models on held-out nonoutlier images also. We visualized the regions of the images that the models used for their decisions.\nArea under receiver operating characteristic curve for outlier detection was consistently higher using ClassClust compared with the previous methods. Average accuracy on held-out nonoutlier images was also higher, and the visualizations of image regions were more informative using ClassClust.\nThe ability to flag outlier test cases need not be at odds with the ability to accurately classify nonoutliers in AI models. Although the latter capability has received research and regulatory attention, AI models for clinical deployment should possess the former as well.", "Diagnosis of tuberculosis, and especially the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, still faces challenges in clinical practice. There are several reasons for this. Methods based on the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are insufficiently sensitive, methods based on the detection of Mtb-specific immune responses cannot always differentiate active disease from latent infection, and some of the serological markers of infection with Mtb are insufficiently specific to differentiate tuberculosis from other inflammatory diseases. New tools based on technologies such as flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, high-throughput sequencing, and artificial intelligence have the potential to solve this dilemma. The aim of this review was to provide an updated overview of current efforts to optimize classical diagnostic methods, as well as new molecular and other methodologies, for accurate diagnosis of patients with Mtb infection.", "The No Surprises Act (NSA), which took effect on January 1, 2022, applies a qualifying payment amount (QPA) as an out-of-network payment reference point. An understanding of how QPA measures compare with the in-network and out-of-network payments physicians received before the NSA implementation may be useful to policy makers and stakeholders.\nTo estimate the QPA for geographic and funding markets and compare QPA estimates with in-network and out-of-network payments for 2019 emergency medicine claims.\nThis cross-sectional study of US commercial insurance claims assessed the Health Care Cost Institute's 2019 commercial professional emergency medicine claims (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes 99281-99285 and 99291) and included enrollees in commercial health maintenance organizations, exclusive provider organizations, point of service, and preferred provider organizations self-funded and fully insured through Aetna, Humana, and some Blue Health Intelligence plans. Claims with missing or inconsistent data fields were excluded. Data were analyzed November 1, 2021, to April 7, 2022.\nThe QPA was calculated as the median allowed amount of all observed claims within strata defined by geographic region, CPT code, and funding market. For each stratum, the ratio of mean in-network allowed amounts to QPAs and mean out-of-network allowed amounts to QPAs were calculated. Then the volume-weighted mean of these ratios was computed across CPT codes within each geographic and funding market stratum.\nThe analytic sample included 7\u202f556\u202f541 professional emergency claims with a mean (SD) allowed amount of $313 ($306) and mean (SD) QPA of $252 ($133). Among the 650 geographic and market strata in the sample, the mean in-network allowed amounts were 14% (ratio, 0.96) higher than the estimated QPA. For the subset of strata with a sufficient sample of out-of-network claims (n\u2009=\u2009227), the mean out-of-network payments were 112% (ratio, 2.12) higher than the QPA. More generous out-of-network payments were from self-funded plans (120% [ratio, 2.20] higher than the QPA estimate) vs fully insured plans (43% [ratio, 1.43] higher than the QPA estimate). Mean in-network allowed amounts for nonphysician clinicians were 4% (ratio, 1.04) lower than the QPA, whereas mean in-network allowed amounts for physicians were 15% (ratio, 1.15) higher than the QPA estimates. These differences remained after adjusting for geographic region.\nThe findings of this cross-sectional study of US commercial insurance claims suggest that the NSA may have heterogeneous implications for out-of-network payments and negotiating leverage experienced by emergency medicine physicians in different geographic markets, with the potential for greater implications in the self-funded market.", "To review the progress of research on photoplethysmography- (PPG-) based cuffless continuous blood pressure monitoring technologies and prospect the challenges that need to be addressed in the future.\nUsing Web of Science and PubMed as search engines, the literature on cuffless continuous blood pressure studies using PPG signals in the recent five years were searched.\nBased on the retrieved literature, this paper describes the available open datasets, commonly used signal preprocessing methods, and model evaluation criteria. Early researches employed multisite PPG signals to calculate pulse wave velocity or time and predicted blood pressure by a simple linear equation. Later, extensive researches were dedicated to mine the features of PPG signals related to blood pressure and regressed blood pressure by machine learning models. Most recently, many researches have emerged to experiment with complex deep learning models for blood pressure prediction with the raw PPG signal as input.\nThis paper summarized the methods in the retrieved literature, provided insight into the artificial intelligence algorithms employed in the literature, and concluded with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities for the development of cuffless continuous blood pressure monitoring technologies.", "Ever Since, pharmaceutical companies are facing challenges to develop new drug products faster and economical with good quality, safety and efficacy. The advent of Artificial intelligence (AI) with computational technology empowers scientists, impacts society at a great scale by developing new drugs at rapid pace. Artificial intelligence is the science and engineering of creating intelligent machines using personified knowledge. There are many opportunities to apply AI tools to the drug discovery pipeline. Examples include target identification, identification of biomarkers, molecular modelling, synthesis of molecules, predicting toxicity and picking up leads. Further, this technology also helps the clinical scientists in clinical trial design, execution and real-time analysis. Altogether it facilitates the process of drug discovery, development and also provides better therapy to the patients. Apart from drug discovery and development, AI also has applications in the area of diagnosis, drug delivery, patient adherence and better monitoring of safety. There are many instances where AI can perform tasks better than humans and aid healthcare providers in treating patients. In this article, we have provided discussion on how AI is advancing the health care field to achieve greater success.", "Human behavior during COVID-19 has led to the study of attitude and preferences among the population in different circumstances. In this sense, studying human behavior can contribute to creating policies for integral education, which should consider the convergence between social responsibility and spiritual intelligence. This can lead to the sensitization of practices and attitude modification within society. The purpose of our research was to explore the spiritual intelligence attitudes of university students from the perspective of social responsibility, considering the sociodemographic characteristics of the research subjects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research design is quantitative and sectional, due to the use of two quantitative scales. The participants were university students from a city located in south-central Chile. A total of 415 participations were collected, of which 362 applications were valid. Statistically significant differences were found according to gender and age. Women and the student cohort between 18 and 24 years of age placed more importance on spiritual necessities. We thus highlight the necessity to have adequate spaces for spiritual intelligence training given its links with socially responsible behavior and, finally, the development of explanatory studies to determine its causalities. In practice, these results contribute to designing an educational policy on the formation of integral spiritual intelligence for future professionals.", "A patient subset with gastroparesis (GP) has normal gastric myoelectrical activity (GMA) and pyloric dysfunction.\n(1) To determine pyloric balloon dilation (BD) effect on symptoms and gastric emptying in GP patients with normal 3 cycles per minute (cpm) GMA. (2) To demonstrate GMA-based artificial intelligence (AI)-derived formulae predict BD success at 10-12-month follow-up.\nCohort subjects completed baseline electrogastrogram w/water load satiety test (WLST), solid-phase nuclear gastric emptying, Gastrointestinal Cardinal Symptom Index (ANMS GCSI-DD) and Leeds questionnaires. Subjects were divided into two groups based on response to the WLST. Group 1 (n\u2009=\u200926) with hypernormal/normal 3\u00a0cpm GMA and Group 2 (n\u2009=\u20094) hyponormal/normal range 3\u00a0cpm GMA, compared to healthy normals. All subjects underwent endoscopic pyloric BD. After 10-12\u00a0months, gastric emptying and dyspepsia questionnaires were repeated to evaluate outcomes.\nGroup 1 ANMS GCSI-DD scores improved from 2 points at baseline (BL) to 0 at follow-up (f/u) (p\u2009<\u20090.001); Group 2 ANMS GSCI-DD scores were 2 at BL and 1.6 at f/u (p\u2009=\u20090.25). Leeds scores improved (p\u2009<\u20090.001) only for Group 1. Group 1 gastric emptying improved (54.5% retained at 2\u00a0h at BL vs. 12.2% at f/u, p\u2009<\u20090.001) in contrast to Group 2 patients (51.25% at BL vs. 56.25% at f/u, p\u2009=\u20090.252). Percentage 3\u00a0cpm GMA decreased (41.1% at BL vs. 24.9% at f/u, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.005) in Group 1 versus Group 2 (15.3% at BL vs. 23.4% at f/u, p\u2009=\u20090.114). AI-derived GMA threshold (GMAT) of 0.59 predicted positive pyloric BD outcomes at 10-12\u00a0months with sensitivity 96%, specificity 75%, and 93% correct classification.\nPyloric BD improved symptoms and gastric emptying long term in patients with GP and hypernormal/normal 3\u00a0cpm GMA. AI-derived GMAT predicted pyloric BD success. GMA post-WLST and GMAT are objective measures for improved selection and outcomes for endoscopic pyloric BD.", "Big data studies are on the rise in vascular neurosurgery. Advanced computer processing power combined with vast amounts of digitized data collected and stored by electronic medical records have led to studies using machine learning, deep learning algorithms, and their applications-artificial intelligence. Big data is challenging the gold standard model of randomized controlled trials introducing more pragmatic research designs including registries and registry-based randomized trails. There is a maturation of cerebrovascular disease studies. Studies have larger patient sample sizes allowing for more compelling conclusions that we reach with higher confidence. This pertains to diagnosis, treatment, outcomes, and a more nuanced understanding of less common presentations of illnesses. The following review will critically discuss big data applications in vascular neurosurgery as well as its implications in quality improvement, innovation, and global neurosurgery.", "Monitoring ex-situ water parameters, namely heavy metals, needs time and laboratory work for water sampling and analytical processes, which can retard the response to ongoing pollution events. Previous studies have successfully applied fast modeling techniques such as artificial intelligence algorithms to predict heavy metals. However, neither low-cost feature predictability nor explainability assessments have been considered in the modeling process. This study proposes a reliable and explainable framework to find an effective model and feature set to predict heavy metals in groundwater. The integrated assessment framework has four steps: model selection uncertainty, feature selection uncertainty, predictive uncertainty, and model interpretability. The results show that Random Forest is the most suitable model, and quick-measure parameters can be used as predictors for arsenic (As), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn). Although the model performance is auspicious, it likely produces significant uncertainties. The findings also demonstrate that arsenic is related to nutrients and spatial distribution, while Fe and Mn are affected by spatial distribution and salinity. Some limitations and suggestions are also discussed to improve the prediction accuracy and interpretability.", "Health is influenced by how the gut microbiome develops as a result of external and internal factors, such as nutrition, the environment, medication use, age, sex, and genetics. Alpha and beta diversity metrics and (enterotype) clustering methods are commonly employed to perform population studies and to analyse the effects of various treatments, yet, with the continuous development of (new) sequencing technologies, and as various omics fields as a result become more accessible for investigation, increasingly sophisticated methodologies are needed and indeed being developed in order to disentangle the complex ways in which the gut microbiome and health are intertwined. Diseases of affluence, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), are commonly linked to species associated with the Bacteroides enterotype(s) and a decline of various (beneficial) complex microbial trophic networks, which are in turn linked to the aforementioned factors. In this review, we (1) explore the effects that some of the most common internal and external factors have on the gut microbiome composition and how these in turn relate to T2D and CVD, and (2) discuss research opportunities enabled by and the limitations of some of the latest technical developments in the microbiome sector, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI), strain tracking, and peak to trough ratios.", "Despite continuing interest in the impact of employees' emotional intelligence (EI) in explaining for their engagement and emotional exhaustion, there are still large gaps in our understanding of the role played by contextual EI-related factors, such as an EI-related organizational culture and supervisors' emotionally intelligent behavior (EIB). This two-study research approaches EI from a macro-level perspective, attempting to address three objectives: (1) to develop and define a theoretical concept of EI-supportive organizational culture, (2) to develop and validate measures of organizations' EI-related values and practices, and (3) to investigate their top-down effect on employee engagement and exhaustion, via supervisor EI-related behavior. In the first study, we conceptualize and develop measures of perceived EI-related organizational values and human resource management (HRM) practices, as separate yet related dimensions of organizations' EI-related culture, and test their validity. In the second study, we build on the job demands-resources (JD-R) theory and Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) framework to develop and test a model of the process links between perceived EI-related values and HRM practices and employee engagement and exhaustion, using a large sample of employees across industries in the USA workforce (N = 12,375). In line with our hypotheses, the findings suggest that EI-supportive HRM practices have a top-down effect on employee engagement and exhaustion via supervisor EIB, whereas low regard for emotions values has a top-down effect on employee exhaustion via supervisor emotional misbehavior. Results are discussed in the context of the JD-R theory, AMO framework, and the EI literature.", "The second International Transplant Science (ITS) meeting jointly organized by the European Society for Organ Transplantation (ESOT), the American Society of Transplantation (AST), and The Transplantation Society (TTS) took place in May 2022 in one of Europe's most iconic cities: Berlin, Germany. The ITS meeting 2022 was designed to serve as an international platform for scientific discussions on the latest ground-breaking discoveries in the field, while providing an excellent opportunity to present cutting-edge research to the scientific community. We think this is fundamental for the exchange of new ideas and establishment of collaborative work between advanced transplant experts, young professionals and early-stage researchers and students. Scientific sessions tackled hot topics in transplantation such as mechanisms of tolerance, biomarkers, big data and artificial intelligence. Our educational pre-meeting focused on the breakthrough and challenges in single-cell multimodal omics. The program included panel discussions illuminating various topics concerning conflicts and problems related to gender, such as challenges for female scientists. Attendees returned to their institutes with not only profound knowledge of the latest discoveries, technologies, and concepts in basic and translational science, but also inspired and excited after discussions and networking sessions with fellow scientists which have been duly missed during the pandemic.", "The interpretability of deep neural networks has attracted increasing attention in recent years, and several methods have been created to interpret the \"black box\" model. Fundamental limitations remain, however, that impede the pace of understanding the networks, especially the extraction of understandable semantic space. In this work, the framework of semantic explainable artificial intelligence\u00a0(S-XAI) is introduced, which utilizes a sample compression method based on the distinctive row-centered principal component analysis (PCA) that is different from the conventional column-centered PCA to obtain common traits of samples from the convolutional neural network (CNN), and extracts understandable semantic spaces on the basis of discovered semantically sensitive neurons and visualization techniques. Statistical interpretation of the semantic space is also provided, and the concept of semantic probability is proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that S-XAI is effective in providing a semantic interpretation for the CNN, and offers broad usage, including trustworthiness assessment and semantic sample searching.", "There is existing evidence on how excessive screen exposure can be detrimental to cognitive health, and in recent years there has been an increase in the usage of mobile phones by adolescents. We aimed to examine the association between mobile phone screen exposure and cognitive function among a young healthy population. We carried out a cross-sectional study conducted in 632 adolescents (13.89 \u00b1 0.52 years old). Exposure data were collected through self-reported questionnaires, and cognitive outcomes were assessed by different computer-based neuropsychological tests. Compared to students in the lowest tertile (<9 min/day) of mobile phone screen exposure (MPSE), those in the medium tertile (9-20 min/day) showed significantly higher hit reaction time standard error (HRT-SE, higher inattentiveness) = (14.9 ms, 95% CI = 0.6; 29.3), as did as those in the highest tertile (>20 min/day) = (11.1 ms, 95% CI = 2.8; 25.0). When adjusting for confounders, the association held for the medium-MPSE tertile (17.6 ms, 95% CI = 3.4; 31.7). When further adjusting for intermediate factors, an increase in inattentiveness scores was also observed in both groups, with higher HRT-SE values for participants in the medium (15.8 ms, 95% CI = 1.4; 30.3) and highest MPSE tertiles (14.97 ms, 95% CI = 0.9; 29.1). There were no significant associations with fluid intelligence or working memory scores. Overall, our study shows that healthy teenagers reporting higher screen exposure may be affected in their attention performance. However, more studies are needed to determine the causality of these associations and to better shape the screen exposure recommended guidelines for brain health during adolescence.", "Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive/Environmental/Endemic Disease (CBRNE3) incidents encompass a wide spectrum of events from natural events/disasters to industrial accidents through to deliberate military release and nuclear war. The UK military operates globally and in environments that are often austere. The very nature of these environments means that CBRNE3 incidents are a very real risk, and a CBRNE3 incident in a well-developed society could ultimately create an austere environment. Responding to such an event in an austere environment poses challenges.The very nature of the environment may be problematic. It may be very remote with limited or no access by road and/or air. It may have limited resources such as water and infrastructure required to manage the event. Extremes of temperature and weather may pose a risk to casualties and responders alike. Specialist teams and equipment may be required, but the host or partner nations may not have suitable capability and these resources may take time to mobilise from the home base. The volume of equipment and material needed in the response may overwhelm logistical chains which may not be robust enough to withstand the initial incident.Proper planning and preparedness is crucial to operating in and managing a CBRNE3 incident in an austere environment. Recognition of the potential threat by intelligence gathering and recognition by personnel on the ground are essential. This requires an appropriate awareness at all levels of command and appropriate prior training, including interoperability training with partner forces. Ultimately, robust planning and training is key to managing CBRNE3 incidents in an austere environment.", "Although numerous studies have described the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening among diabetic populations, studies among populations in rural areas are rare. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the application value of an AI-based diagnostic system for DR screening in rural areas of midwest China.\nIn this diagnostic accuracy study, diabetes mellitus (DM) patients in the National Basic Public Health Information Systems of Licheng County and Lucheng County of Changzhi city from July to December 2020 were selected as the target population. A total of 7824 eyes of 3933 DM patients were enrolled in this screening; the patients included 1395 males and 2401 females, with an average age of 19-87 years (63\u00b18.735 years). All fundus photographs were collected by a professional ophthalmologist under natural pupil conditions in a darkroom using the Zhiyuan Huitu fundus image AI analysis software EyeWisdom. The AI-based diagnostic system and ophthalmologists were tasked with diagnosing the photos independently, and the consistency rate, sensitivity and specificity of the two methods in diagnosing DR were calculated and compared.\nThe prevalence rates of DR according to the ophthalmologist and AI diagnoses were 22.7% and 22.5%, respectively; the consistency rate was 81.6%. The sensitivity and specificity of the AI system relative to the ophthalmologists' grades were 81.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80.3% 82.1%) and 94.3% (95% CI: 93.7% 94.8%), respectively. There was no significant difference in diagnostic outcomes between the methods (\u03c72 = 0.329, P = 0.566, P>0.05), and the AI-based diagnostic system had high consistency with the ophthalmologists' diagnostic results (\u03ba = 0.752).\nOur research demonstrated that DR patients in rural area hospitals can be screened feasibly. Compared with that of the ophthalmologists, however, the accuracy of the AI system must be improved. The results of this study might lend support to the large-scale application of AI in DR screening among different populations.", "In guilty plea hearings, judges must determine whether defendants' plea decisions were made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Little is known, however, about how plea hearings unfold, especially in juvenile court, where hearings are generally closed to the public. In this study, we had the unique opportunity to systematically observe plea hearings in juvenile and criminal court.\nWe predicted that plea hearings would be brief and that defendant participation, especially among juveniles, would be minimal. We also explored how often judges addressed the plea validity components of knowingness, intelligence, and voluntariness and whether addressing these components differed by the type of court (juvenile, criminal), pretrial custody status, and pled-to charge severity.\nTrained coders in California (n = 104, juvenile court) and Virginia (n = 140, juvenile court; n = 593, criminal court) systematically observed more than 800 guilty plea hearings. Coders reliably documented hearing length, whether the defendant was in pretrial custody, whether the evidence was reviewed, details on defendant participation, and judicial attention to plea validity.\nOn average, juvenile plea hearings lasted about 7 min and criminal plea hearings lasted 13 min. Prosecutors rarely reviewed evidence against the defendants in the juvenile courts, and in one juvenile court, judges paid virtually no attention to plea validity. In the other two courts, certain waived rights (e.g., to trial, to silence) were reviewed consistently. Depending on the court, hearing length and plea validity elements addressed varied by defendants' prehearing custody status and the pled-to charge severity.\nThese findings provide novel insight into how components necessary for plea admissibility-knowingness, voluntariness, and intelligence-are discussed with defendants and, in doing so, raise concerns about the degree to which plea validity is actively assessed in plea hearings. Plea hearings are formal, minutes-long events in which defendant engagement is low.

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools may add to the armamentarium for physicians, decreasing the time to diagnosis and limiting the burden of dysphonia.\nVoice recordings of patients were collected from 2019 to 2021 using smartphones. The Saarbruecken dataset was included for comparison. Audio files were converted to mel-spectrograms using TensorFlow. Diagnostic categories were created to group pathology, including neurological and muscular disorders, inflammatory, mass lesions, and normal. The samples were further separated into sustained/a/and the rainbow passage.\nTwo hundred three prospective samples and 1131 samples were used from the Saarbruecken database. The AI detected abnormal pathology with an F1-score of 98%. The artificial neural network (ANN) differentiated key pathologies, including unilateral paralysis, laryngitis, adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD), mass lesions, and normal samples with 39%-87% F-1 scores. The Calgary database models had higher F-1 scores in a head-to-head comparison to the Saarbruecken and combined datasets (87% vs. 58% and 50%). The AI outperformed otolaryngologists using a standardized test set of recordings (83% compared to 55%\u2009\u00b1\u200915%).\nAn AI tool was created to differentiate pathology by individual or categorical diagnosis with high evaluation metrics. Prospective data should be collected in a controlled fashion to reduce intrinsic variability between recordings. Multi-center data collaborations are imperative to increase the prediction capability of AI tools for detecting vocal cord pathology. We provide proof-of-concept for an AI tool to assist primary care physicians in managing dysphonic patients.\n3 Laryngoscope, 133:1952-1960, 2023.", "This study used the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework to identify the factors involved in the decisions made by integrated medical and healthcare organizations to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) elderly care service resources.\nThis study identified the Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory-Interpretive Structural Modeling (DEMATEL-ISM) method was used to construct a multilayer recursive structural model and to analyze the interrelationships between the levels. A MICMAC quadrant diagram was used for a cluster analysis.\nThe ISM recursive structural model was divided into a total of seven layers. The bottom layer contained the four factors of High risk of data leakage (T1), Lack of awareness of the value and benefits of AI healthcare technology (T5), Lack of management leadership support (O1), and Government policies (E1). Having a low dependency but high driving force, these factors are the root causes of adoption by healthcare organizations. The topmost layer contained the most direct factors, which had a high dependency but the low driving force, influencing adoption: Competitive pressures (E2), Lack of patient trust (E5), and Lack of excellent partnerships (E7). Healthcare organizations are more concerned with technology and their environments when deciding to adopt intelligent healthcare resources.\nThe combination of the three methods of DEMATEL-ISM-MICMAC construction models provides new ideas for smart healthcare services for hospitals. The DEMATEL method favors the construction dimension of the micro-model, while the ISM method favors the construction dimension of the macro-model. Combining these two methods may reduce the loss of information within the system, simplify the matrix calculation workload, and improve the efficiency of operations while decomposing the complex problems into several sub-problems in a more comprehensive and detailed way. Conducting cluster analysis of the adoption determinants utilizing MICMAC quadrant diagrams may provide strong methodological guidance and decision-making recommendations for government departments, senior decision-makers in healthcare organizations, and policy-makers in associations in the senior care industry.", "Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is imperative to detect cases of TB as early as possible because if left untreated, there is a 70% chance of a patient dying within 10 years. The necessity for supplementary tools has increased in mid to low-income countries due to the rise of automation in healthcare sectors. The already limited resources are being heavily allocated towards controlling other dangerous diseases. Modern digital radiography (DR) machines, used for screening chest X-rays of potential TB victims are very practical. Coupled with computer-aided detection (CAD) with the aid of artificial intelligence, radiologists working in this field can really help potential patients. In this study, progressive resizing is introduced for training models to perform automatic inference of TB using chest X-ray images. ImageNet fine-tuned Normalization-Free Networks (NFNets) are trained for classification and the Score-Cam algorithm is utilized to highlight the regions in the chest X-Rays for detailed inference on the diagnosis. The proposed method is engineered to provide accurate diagnostics for both binary and multiclass classification. The models trained with this method have achieved 96.91% accuracy, 99.38% AUC, 91.81% sensitivity, and 98.42% specificity on a multiclass classification dataset. Moreover, models have also achieved top-1 inference metrics of 96% accuracy and 98% AUC for binary classification. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed method can be used as a secondary decision tool in a clinical setting for assisting radiologists.", "Knowledge of a person's risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is required to triage candidates for preventive interventions, surveillance, and treatment trials. ADRD risk indexes exist for this purpose, but each includes only a subset of known risk factors. Information missing from published indexes could improve risk prediction. In the Dunedin Study of a population-representative New Zealand-based birth cohort followed to midlife (N\u2009=\u2009938, 49.5% female), we compared associations of four leading risk indexes with midlife antecedents of ADRD against a novel benchmark index comprised of nearly all known ADRD risk factors, the Dunedin ADRD Risk Benchmark (DunedinARB). Existing indexes included the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia index (CAIDE), LIfestyle for BRAin health index (LIBRA), Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI), and risks selected by the Lancet Commission on Dementia. The Dunedin benchmark was comprised of 48 separate indicators of risk organized into 10 conceptually distinct risk domains. Midlife antecedents of ADRD treated as outcome measures included age-45 measures of brain structural integrity [magnetic resonance imaging-assessed: (i) machine-learning-algorithm-estimated brain age, (ii) log-transformed volume of white matter hyperintensities, and (iii) mean grey matter volume of the hippocampus] and measures of brain functional integrity [(i) objective cognitive function assessed via the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV, (ii) subjective problems in everyday cognitive function, and (iii) objective cognitive decline measured as residualized change in cognitive scores from childhood to midlife on matched Weschler Intelligence scales]. All indexes were quantitatively distributed and proved informative about midlife antecedents of ADRD, including algorithm-estimated brain age (\u03b2's from 0.16 to 0.22), white matter hyperintensities volume (\u03b2's from 0.16 to 0.19), hippocampal volume (\u03b2's from -0.08 to -0.11), tested cognitive deficits (\u03b2's from -0.36 to -0.49), everyday cognitive problems (\u03b2's from 0.14 to 0.38), and longitudinal cognitive decline (\u03b2's from -0.18 to -0.26). Existing indexes compared favourably to the comprehensive benchmark in their association with the brain structural integrity measures but were outperformed in their association with the functional integrity measures, particularly subjective cognitive problems and tested cognitive decline. Results indicated that existing indexes could be improved with targeted additions, particularly of measures assessing socioeconomic status, physical and sensory function, epigenetic aging, and subjective overall health. Existing premorbid ADRD risk indexes perform well in identifying linear gradients of risk among members of the general population at midlife, even when they include only a small subset of potential risk factors. They could be improved, however, with targeted additions to more holistically capture the different facets of risk for this multiply determined, age-related disease.", "The clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale is commonly used to diagnose dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The sum of boxes of the CDR (CDR-SB) has recently been emphasized and applied to interventional trials for tracing the progression of cognitive impairment (CI) in the early stages of AD. We aimed to study the influence of baseline CDR-SB on disease progression to dementia or reversion to normal cognition (NC).\nThe baseline CDR < 1 cohort registered from September 2015 to August 2020 with longitudinal follow-up in the History-based Artificial Intelligence Clinical Dementia Diagnostic System (HAICDDS) database was retrospectively analyzed for the rates of conversion to CDR \u2265 1. A Cox regression model was applied to study the influence of CDR-SB levels on progression, adjusting for age, education, sex, neuropsychological tests, neuropsychiatric symptoms, parkinsonism, and multiple vascular risk factors.\nA total of 1,827 participants were analyzed, including 1,258 (68.9%) non-converters, and 569 (31.1%) converters with mean follow-up of 2.1 (range 0.4-5.5) and 1.8 (range 0.3-5.0) years, respectively. Conversion rates increased with increasing CDR-SB scores. Compared to a CDR-SB score of 0, the hazard ratios (HR) for conversion to dementia were 1.51, 1.91, 2.58, 2.13, 3.46, 3.85, 3.19, 5.12, and 5.22 for CDR-SB scores of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and \u22654.5, respectively (all p < 0.05 except for CDR-SB score = 0.5). In addition, older age, lower education, lower cognitive performance, and a history of diabetes also increased conversion rates. Furthermore, reversions to NC were 12.5, 5.6, 0.9, and 0% for CDR-SB scores of 0.5, 1.0-2.0, 2.5-3.5 and \u22654.0, respectively (p < 0.001).\nCDR-SB in predementia or very mild dementia (VMD) stages highly predicts progression to dementia or reversion to NC. Therefore, CDR-SB could be a good candidate for tracing the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in populations without dementia.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is more and more widely used in cancer, which is of great help to doctors in diagnosis and treatment. This study aims to summarize the current research hotspots in the Application of Artificial Intelligence in Cancer (AAIC) and to assess the research trends in AAIC.\nScientific publications for AAIC-related research from 1 January 1998 to 1 July 2022 were obtained from the Web of Science database. The metrics analyses using bibliometrics software included publication, keyword, author, journal, institution, and country. In addition, the blustering analysis on the binary matrix was performed on hot keywords.\nThe total number of papers in this study is 1592. The last decade of AAIC research has been divided into a slow development phase (2013-2018) and a rapid development phase (2019-2022). An international collaboration centered in the USA is dedicated to the development and application of AAIC. Li J is the most prolific writer in AAIC. Through clustering analysis and high-frequency keyword research, it has been shown that AI plays a significantly important role in the prediction, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of cancer. Classification, diagnosis, carcinogenesis, risk, and validation are developing topics. Eight hotspot fields of AAIC were also identified.\nAAIC can benefit cancer patients in diagnosing cancer, assessing the effectiveness of treatment, making a decision, predicting prognosis and saving costs. Future AAIC research may be dedicated to optimizing AI calculation tools, improving accuracy, and promoting AI.", "In mental state decoding, researchers aim to identify the set of mental states (e.g., experiencing happiness or fear) that can be reliably identified from the activity patterns of a brain region (or network). Deep learning (DL) models are highly promising for mental state decoding because of their unmatched ability to learn versatile representations of complex data. However, their widespread application in mental state decoding is hindered by their lack of interpretability, difficulties in applying them to small datasets, and in ensuring their reproducibility and robustness. We recommend approaching these challenges by leveraging recent advances in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and transfer learning, and also provide recommendations on how to improve the reproducibility and robustness of DL models in mental state decoding.", "The management of chronic wounds in the elderly such as pressure injury (also known as bedsore or pressure ulcer) is increasingly important in an ageing population. Accurate classification of the stage of pressure injury is important for wound care planning. Nonetheless, the expertise required for staging is often not available in a residential care home setting. Artificial-intelligence (AI)-based computer vision techniques have opened up opportunities to harness the inbuilt camera in modern smartphones to support pressure injury staging by nursing home carers. In this paper, we summarise the recent development of smartphone or tablet-based applications for wound assessment. Furthermore, we present a new smartphone application (app) to perform real-time detection and staging classification of pressure injury wounds using a deep learning-based object detection system, YOLOv4. Based on our validation set of 144 photos, our app obtained an overall prediction accuracy of 63.2%. The per-class prediction specificity is generally high (85.1%-100%), but have variable sensitivity: 73.3% (stage 1 vs. others), 37% (stage 2 vs. others), 76.7 (stage 3 vs. others), 70% (stage 4 vs. others), and 55.6% (unstageable vs. others). Using another independent test set, 8 out of 10 images were predicted correctly by the YOLOv4 model. When deployed in a real-life setting with two different ambient brightness levels with three different Android phone models, the prediction accuracy of the 10 test images ranges from 80 to 90%, which highlight the importance of evaluation of mobile health (mHealth) application in a simulated real-life setting. This study details the development and evaluation process and demonstrates the feasibility of applying such a real-time staging app in wound care management.", "Today, English is the world's main international language and is widely spoken. In this context, the learning of English has long been valued by all countries. In addition, English plays an essential role in the process of economic globalization, specifically in the majority of countries where English is not the native language. At the same time, as China's integration into the world grows, the importance of English has become more pronounced, and the demand for English language skills has increased. At present, China's ever-expanding opening to the outside world, its developing science and technology, and its rising international status have created an urgent need for English-speaking professionals. This will lay the foundation for China's economic and social development and enable China to play a greater and more active role in international affairs, which has great practical and far-reaching historical significance. At present, the traditional English teaching mode has been criticized due to a great number of issues. At the same time, the new English language standards and the change of evaluation methods have created new demands on English teaching methods. As a result, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, the application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education has brought new directions for the optimization of English classroom. In addition, diversified network technologies also provide new support for the realization of intelligent and collaborative English classroom teaching. To be specific, the maturity of English intelligent speech synthesis and intelligent speech evaluation technologies has enabled intelligent technologies to reach or even surpass the level of human teachers in certain areas. However, due to the limitations of the market environment and evaluation methods, the products that can focus on English classroom teaching are not highly intelligent and less collaborative. What is more, the process of English classroom intelligence has stagnated compared to other subjects. Obviously, from the perspective of integrating artificial intelligence technology with English classroom, it is quite necessary and feasible to design and develop an intelligent teaching assistant that can be applied to college English teaching. As information technology continues to evolve, both national and teacher levels are beginning to focus on how it can be better used in the teaching of subjects. Therefore, the use of online information technology in teaching and learning presents a great opportunity for research and practice in English language learning at the university level.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that started and rapidly became the pandemic of the century, as the number of people infected with it globally exceeded 253.4 million. Since the beginning of the pandemic of COVID-19, over two years have passed. During this hard period, several defies have been coped by the scientific society to know this novel disease, evaluate it, and treat affected patients. All these efforts are done to push back the spread of the virus. This article provides a comprehensive review to learn about the COVID-19 virus and its entry mechanism, its main repercussions on many organs and tissues of the body, identify its symptoms in the short and long terms, in addition to recognize the role of diagnosis imaging in COVID-19. Principally, the quick evolution of active vaccines act an exceptional accomplishment where leaded to decrease rate of death worldwide. However, some hurdels still have to be overcome. Many proof referrers that infection with CoV-19 causes neurological dis function in a substantial ratio of influenced patients, where these symptoms appear severely during the infection and still less is known about the potential long term consequences for the brain, where Loss of smell is a neurological sign and rudimentary symptom of COVID-19. Hence, we review the causes of olfactory bulb dysfunction and Anosmia associated with COVID-19, the latest appropriate therapeutic strategies for the COVID-19 treatment (e.g., the ACE2 strategy and the Ang II receptor), and the tests through the follow-up phases. Additionally, we discuss the long-term complications of the virus and thus the possibility of improving therapeutic strategies. Moreover, the main steps of artificial intelligence that have been used to foretell and early diagnose COVID-19 are presented, where Artificial intelligence, especially machine learning is emerging as an effective approach for diagnostic image analysis with performance in the discriminate diagnosis of injuries of COVID-19 on multiple organs, comparable to that of human practitioners. The followed methodology to prepare the current survey is to search the related work concerning the mentioned topic from different journals, such as Springer, Wiley, and Elsevier. Additionally, different studies have been compared, the results are collected and then reported as shown. The articles are selected based on the year (i.e., the last three years). Also, different keywords were checked (e.g., COVID-19, COVID-19 Treatment, COVID-19 Symptoms, and COVID-19 and Anosmia).", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is not only disrupting industries and businesses, particularly the ones have fallen behind the adoption, but also significantly impacting public life as well. This calls for government authorities pay attention to public opinions and sentiments towards AI. Nonetheless, there is limited knowledge on what the drivers behind the public perception of AI are. Bridging this gap is the rationale of this paper. As the methodological approach, the study conducts an online public perception survey with the residents of Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, and explores the collected survey data through statistical analysis. The analysis reveals that: (a) the public is concerned of AI invading their privacy, but not much concerned of AI becoming more intelligent than humans; (b) the public trusts AI in their lifestyle, but the trust is lower for companies and government deploying AI; (c) the public appreciates the benefits of AI in urban services and disaster management; (d) depending on the local context, public perceptions vary; and (e) the drivers behind the public perception include gender, age, AI knowledge, and AI experience. The findings inform authorities in developing policies to minimise public concerns and maximise AI awareness.", "To predict improvement of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 1 year after pars plana vitrectomy for epiretinal membrane (ERM) using artificial intelligence methods on optical coherence tomography B-scan images.\nFour hundred and eleven (411) patients with Stage II ERM were divided in a group improvement (IM) (\u226515 ETDRS letters of VA recovery) and a group no improvement (N-IM) (<15 letters) according to 1-year VA improvement after 25-G pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling. Primary outcome was the creation of a deep learning classifier (DLC) based on optical coherence tomography B-scan images for prediction. Secondary outcome was assessment of the influence of various clinical and imaging predictors on BCVA improvement. Inception-ResNet-V2 was trained using standard augmentation techniques. Testing was performed on an external data set. For secondary outcome, B-scan acquisitions were analyzed by graders both before and after fibrillary change processing enhancement.\nThe overall performance of the DLC showed a sensitivity of 87.3% and a specificity of 86.2%. Regression analysis showed a difference in preoperative images prevalence of ectopic inner foveal layer, foveal detachment, ellipsoid zone interruption, cotton wool sign, unprocessed fibrillary changes (odds ratio = 2.75 [confidence interval: 2.49-2.96]), and processed fibrillary changes (odds ratio = 5.42 [confidence interval: 4.81-6.08]), whereas preoperative BCVA and central macular thickness did not differ between groups.\nThe DLC showed high performances in predicting 1-year visual outcome in ERM surgery patients. Fibrillary changes should also be considered as relevant predictors.", "At present, with the gradual development of science and technology, people's life has also produced a lot of changes, the traditional communication technology has been gradually changed by the new computer technology, people's life has become more intelligent. However, many current artificial intelligence technologies rely on the promotion of network data. In the mobile terminal, especially in the poor state of some data network environment, many users' intelligence needs cannot be met. From the perspective of user interaction experience, this paper analyzes and investigates the interactive standby link in detail and systematically based on the perspective of context awareness and carries out a battle summary with the scientific, systematic, reasonable, and executable design methods suitable for an interactive standby state and puts forward the recommended items of matrix decomposition. The static information is embedded in the model. The status of information is imported as a dimension different from the previous matrix factorization model, and the accumulation of interaction between user's status conditions and project factors is considered, as well as the sensitivity difference between user and information project status.

Finally, the training model gets the final prediction score value and puts forward the mobile system user interaction experience art design strategy based on context awareness, which provides a certain idea to meet the needs of mobile system users.", "An international security conference explored how artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for drug discovery could be misused for de novo design of biochemical weapons. A thought experiment evolved into a computational proof.", "The year 2020 brought many changes to the lives of people all over the world with the outbreak of COVID-19; we saw lockdowns for months and deaths of many individuals, which set the world economy back miles. As research was conducted to create vaccines and cures that would eradicate the virus, precautionary measures were imposed on people to help reduce the spread the disease. These measures included washing of hands, appropriate distancing in social gatherings and wearing of masks to cover the face and nose. But due to human error, most people failed to adhere to this face mask rule and this could be monitored using artificial intelligence. In this work, we carried out a survey on Masked Face Recognition (MFR) and Occluded Face Recognition (OFR) deep learning techniques used to detect whether a face mask was being worn. The major problem faced by these models is that people often wear face masks incorrectly, either not covering the nose or mouth, which is equivalent to not wearing it at all. The deep learning algorithms detected the covered features on the face to ensure that the correct parts of the face were covered and had amazingly effective results.", "Network biology finds application in interpreting molecular interaction networks and providing insightful inferences using graph theoretical analysis of biological systems. The integration of computational biomodelling approaches with different hybrid network-based techniques provides additional information about the behaviour of complex systems. With increasing advances in high-throughput technologies in biological research, attempts have been made to incorporate this information into network structures, which has led to a continuous update of network biology approaches over time. The newly minted centrality measures accommodate the details of omics data and regulatory network structure information. The unification of graph network properties with classical mathematical and computational modelling approaches and technologically advanced approaches like machine-learning- and artificial intelligence-based algorithms leverages the potential application of these techniques. These computational advances prove beneficial and serve various applications such as essential gene prediction, identification of drug-disease interaction and gene prioritization. Hence, in this review, we have provided a comprehensive overview of the emerging landscape of molecular interaction networks using graph theoretical approaches. With the aim to provide information on the wide range of applications of network biology approaches in understanding the interaction and regulation of genes, proteins, enzymes and metabolites at different molecular levels, we have reviewed the methods that utilize network topological properties, emerging hybrid network-based approaches and applications that integrate machine learning techniques to analyse molecular interaction networks. Further, we have discussed the applications of these approaches in biomedical research with a note on future prospects.", "The overnight polysomnography shows a range of drawbacks to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that have led to the search for artificial intelligence-based alternatives. Many classic machine learning methods have been already evaluated for this purpose. In this chapter, we show the main approaches found in the scientific literature along with the most used data to develop the models, useful and large easily available databases, and suitable methods to assess performances. In addition, a range of results from selected studies are presented as examples of these methods. Very high diagnostic performances are reported in these results regardless of the approaches taken. This leads us to conclude that conventional machine learning methods are useful techniques to develop new OSA diagnosis simplification proposals and to act as benchmark for other more recent methods such as deep learning.", "The diagnosis of keratoconus is closely related to artificial intelligence. Machine learning is the core of artificial intelligence, machine learning models combined with corneal information are effective supplements in keratoconus diagnosis and provide decision support. These artificial intelligence systems can bring efficiency, reduce artificial misjudgment and effectively reduce manpower costs. In this paper, by summarizing the previous machine learning models that assisted the diagnosis of keratoconus, we may help researchers understand the relevant knowledge in the field of intelligent diagnosis of keratoconus, which is of great significance for further machine learning research.\n\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u606f\u606f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u89d2\u819c\u5f62\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bfb\u56fe\u6548\u7387\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u4e3a\u8bef\u5224\u51e0\u7387\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u529b\u6210\u672c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u7eb3\u65e2\u5f80\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u4e86\u89e3\u5706\u9525\u89d2\u819c\u667a\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u9886\u57df\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f00\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002.", "The development of computer-aided detection (CAD) using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is rapidly evolving. Submission of AI/ML-based CAD devices for regulatory approval requires information about clinical trial design and performance criteria, but the requirements vary between countries. This study compares the requirements for AI/ML-based CAD devices approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan. A list of 45 FDA-approved and 12 PMDA-approved AI/ML-based CAD devices was compiled. In the USA, devices classified as computer-aided simple triage were approved based on standalone software testing, whereas devices classified as computer-aided detection/diagnosis were approved based on reader study testing. In Japan, however, there was no clear distinction between evaluation methods according to the category. In the USA, a prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted for AI/ML-based CAD devices used for the detection of colorectal polyps, whereas in Japan, such devices were approved based on standalone software testing. This study indicated that the different viewpoints of AI/ML-based CAD in the two countries influenced the selection of different evaluation methods. This study's findings may be useful for defining a unified global development and approval standard for AI/ML-based CAD.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly used in radiology research to deal with large and complex imaging data sets. Nowadays, ML tools have become easily accessible to anyone. Such a low threshold to accessibility might lead to inappropriate usage and misinterpretation, without a clear intention. Therefore, ensuring methodological rigor is of paramount importance. Getting closer to the real-world clinical implementation of AI, a basic understanding of the main concepts should be a must for every radiology professional. In this respect, simplified explanations of the key concepts along with pitfalls and recommendations would be helpful for general radiology community to develop and improve their AI mindset. In this work, twenty-two key issues are reviewed within three categories: pre-modeling, modeling, and post-modeling. Firstly, the concept is shortly defined for each issue. Then, related common pitfalls and best practices are provided. Specifically, the issues included in this paper were validity of scientific question, unrepresentative samples, sample size, missing data, quality of reference standard, batch effect, reliability of features, feature scaling, multi-collinearity, class imbalance, data and target leakage, high-dimensional data, optimization, overfitting, generalization, performance metrics, clinical utility, comparison with conventional statistical and clinical methods, interpretability and explainability, randomness, transparent reporting, and sharing data.", "Telemedicine can be defined as a health care service that, specifically in the field of diagnostics, employs remote transfer of a large volume of data from a large number of subjects at the same time. This data is subsequently processed on a central basis and returned to a large number of health care providers by whom the service was ordered on national or international level. In arrhythmology, telemedicine is used particularly in long-term ECG monitoring to diagnose arrhythmias and check out treatment outcome via external recorders, smart watch, and implantable devices. To facilitate analysis of large telemedicine data volume, artificial intelligence is being increasingly exploited.", "In recent years, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) models is attracting increasing global interest in the field of ophthalmology. DL models are considered the current state-of-art among the AI technologies. In fact, DL systems have the capability to recognize, quantify and describe pathological clinical features. Their role is currently being investigated for the early diagnosis and management of several retinal diseases and glaucoma. The application of DL models to fundus photographs, visual fields and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging has provided promising results in the early detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR), wet age-related macular degeneration (w-AMD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and glaucoma. In this review we analyze the current evidence of AI applied to these ocular diseases, as well as discuss the possible future developments and potential clinical implications, without neglecting the present limitations and challenges in order to adopt AI and DL models as powerful tools in the everyday routine clinical practice.", "To investigate the incidence, clinical characteristics, gene mutations and prognosis of fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAOD) in newborns in Chongqing.\nBlood samples were collected from 35 374 newborns for screening of FAOD in the Neonatal Screening Center of Women and Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from July 2020 to February 2022.

However, due to the un-estimated quantity of the natural molecular compounds and diversity of the related problems drug discovery such as precise screening of molecular compounds or the evaluation of efficacy, physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetics, it is arduous for researchers to design or screen applicable compounds through old methods. With the rapid development of computer technology recently, especially artificial intelligence (AI), its innovation in the field of virtual screening contributes to an increasing efficiency and accuracy in the process of discovering new drugs.\nThis study systematically reviewed the application of computational approaches and artificial intelligence in drug virtual filtering and devising of TCM and presented the potential perspective of computer-aided TCM development.\nWe made a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Then screening the most typical articles for our research.\nThe systematic review was performed by following the PRISMA guidelines. The databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI were used to search for publications that focused on computer-aided drug virtual screening and design in TCM.\nTotally, 42 corresponding articles were included in literature reviewing. Aforementioned studies were of great significance to the treatment and cost control of many challenging diseases such as COVID-19, diabetes, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), etc. Computational approaches and AI were widely used in virtual screening in the process of TCM advancing, which include structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) and ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS). Besides, computational technologies were also extensively applied in absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) prediction of candidate drugs and new drug design in crucial course of drug discovery.\nThe applications of computer and AI play an important role in the drug virtual screening and design in the field of TCM, with huge application prospects.", "Human-machine teaming (HMT) typically combines perspectives from systems engineering, artificial intelligence (AI) and human-centered design (HCD), to achieve human systems integration (HSI) through the development of an integrative systems representation that encapsulates human and machine attributes and properties.\nThe study explores the main factors contributing to performance, trust and collaboration between expert human operators and increasingly autonomous machines, by developing and using the PRODEC method. PRODEC supports HSI by improving the agile HCD of advanced sociotechnical systems at work, which qualify as human-machine teamwork.\nPRODEC incorporates scenario-based design and human-in-the-loop simulation at design and development time of a sociotechnical system. It is associated with the concept of digital twin. A systemic representation was developed and used, associated with metrics for the evaluation of human-machine teams.\nThe study is essentially methodological. In practice, PRODEC has been used and validated in the MOHICAN project that dealt with the integration of pilots and virtual assistants onboard advanced fighter aircraft. It enabled the development of appropriate metrics and criteria of performance, trust, collaboration, and tangibility (i.e., issues of complexity, maturity, flexibility, stability, and sustainability), which were associated with the identification of emergent functions that help redesign and recalibrate the air combat virtual assistant as well as fighter pilot training.\nPRODEC addresses the crucial issue of how AI systems could and should influence requirements and design of sociotechnical systems that support human work, particularly in contexts of high uncertainty. However, PRODEC is still work in progress and advanced visualization techniques and tools are needed to increase physical and figurative tangibility.", "Asthma significantly impacts human life and health as a chronic disease. Traditional treatments for asthma have several limitations. Artificial intelligence aids in cancer treatment and may also accelerate our understanding of asthma mechanisms. We aimed to develop a new clinical diagnosis model for asthma using artificial neural networks (ANN).\nDatasets (GSE85566, GSE40576, and GSE13716) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and identified differentially expressed CpGs (DECs) enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Random forest (RF) and ANN algorithms further identified gene characteristics and built clinical models. In addition, two external validation datasets (GSE40576 and GSE137716) were used to validate the diagnostic ability of the model.\nThe methylation analysis tool (ChAMP) considered DECs that were up-regulated (n\u2009=121) and down-regulated (n\u2009=20). GO results showed enrichment of actin cytoskeleton organization and cell-substrate adhesion, shigellosis, and serotonergic synapses. RF (random forest) analysis identified 10 crucial DECs (cg05075579, cg20434422, cg03907390, cg00712106, cg05696969, cg22862094, cg11733958, cg00328720, and cg13570822). ANN constructed the clinical model according to 10 DECs. In two external validation datasets (GSE40576 and GSE137716), the Area Under Curve (AUC) for GSE137716 was 1.000, and AUC for GSE40576 was 0.950, confirming the reliability of the model.\nOur findings provide new methylation markers and clinical diagnostic models for asthma diagnosis and treatment.", "The 2021 edition of the Artificial Intelligence Data Challenge was organized by the French Society of Radiology together with the Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales and CentraleSup\u00e9lec with the aim to implement generative adversarial networks (GANs) techniques to provide 1000 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cases of macrotrabecular-massive (MTM) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a rare and aggressive subtype of HCC, generated from a limited number of real cases from multiple French centers.\nA dedicated platform was used by the seven inclusion centers to securely upload their anonymized MRI examinations including all three cross-sectional images (one late arterial and one portal-venous phase T1-weighted images and one fat-saturated T2-weighted image) in compliance with general data protection regulation. The quality of the database was checked by experts and manual delineation of the lesions was performed by the expert radiologists involved in each center. Multidisciplinary teams competed between October 11th, 2021 and February 13th, 2022.\nA total of 91 MTM-HCC datasets of three images each were collected from seven French academic centers. Six teams with a total of 28 individuals participated in this challenge. Each participating team was asked to generate one thousand 3-image cases. The qualitative evaluation was performed by three radiologists using the Likert scale on ten randomly selected cases generated by each participant. A quantitative evaluation was also performed using two metrics, the Frechet inception distance and a leave-one-out accuracy of a 1-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.\nThis data challenge demonstrates the ability of GANs techniques to generate a large number of images from a small sample of imaging examinations of a rare malignant tumor.", "The application of artificial intelligence to interpret the electrocardiogram (ECG) has predominantly included the use of knowledge engineered rule-based algorithms which have become widely used today in clinical practice. However, over recent decades, there has been a steady increase in the number of research studies that are using machine learning (ML) to read or interrogate ECG data.\nThe aim of this study is to review the use of ML with ECG data using a time series approach.\nPapers that address the subject of ML and the ECG were identified by systematically searching databases that archive papers from January 1995 to October 2019. Time series analysis was used to study the changing popularity of the different types of ML algorithms that have been used with ECG data over the past two decades. Finally, a meta-analysis of how various ML techniques performed for various diagnostic classifications was also undertaken.\nA total of 757 papers was identified. Based on results, the use of ML with ECG data started to increase sharply (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) from 2012. Healthcare applications, especially in heart abnormality classification, were the most common application of ML when using ECG data (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001). However, many new emerging applications include using ML and the ECG for biometrics and driver drowsiness. The support vector machine was the technique of choice for a decade. However, since 2018, deep learning has been trending upwards and is likely to be the leading technique in the coming few years. Despite the accuracy paradox, accuracy was the most frequently used metric in the studies reviewed, followed by sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and then AUC.\nApplying ML using ECG data has shown promise. Data scientists and physicians should collaborate to ensure that clinical knowledge is being applied appropriately and is informing the design of ML algorithms. Data scientists also need to consider knowledge guided feature engineering and the explicability of the ML algorithm as well as being transparent in the algorithm's performance to appropriately calibrate human-AI trust. Future work is required to enhance ML performance in ECG classification.", "Outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection that started in Wuhan, China, have quickly spread worldwide. The current situation has contributed to a dynamic rate of hospital admissions. Global efforts by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) communities to develop solutions to assist COVID-19-related research have escalated ever since. However, despite overwhelming efforts from the AI and ML community, many machine learning-based AI systems have been designed as black boxes. This paper proposes a model that utilizes Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to explain a machine learning technique called Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) on a dataset of hospital admissions due to COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. This paper intends to increase the transparency of decision-making in the era of ML by using the proposed LSTM-FCA explainable model. Both LSTM and FCA are able to evaluate the data and explain the model to make the results more understandable and interpretable. The results and discussions are helpful and may lead to new research to optimize the use of ML in various real-world applications and to contain the disease.", "Brachytherapy (BT) consists in the insertion of radioactive implants directly into the tissue through an applicator, in order to kill tumor cells. This is for the tumor tissue to receive a higher dose, whereas the surrounding normal tissues receive a lower dose of radiation because of the rapid fall of the dose. Because of the special anatomical position of the cervix, smaller organ mobility, and higher tolerable doses of radiotherapy in the vagina and uterus, BT has been most widely used to treat cervical cancer and is an important part of radical radiotherapy for this type of cancer. Furthermore, it is closely related to the prognosis of patients. However, the treatment process, including target area delineation, applicator reconstruction, plan design, and optimization, is time-consuming, which may lead to changes in patient's bladder filling or gastrointestinal peristalsis. Therefore, this not only yields a poor patient experience, but may also affect the accuracy of the treatment and prognosis. With the development of computer hardware, deep learning has been gradually applied in different fields and different networks have been developed to solve various problems. By combining deep learning technology with three-dimensional BT technology, the automation of BT planning can be realized, which, in turn, can significantly shorten the treatment time, alleviate the pain of the patient, and improve treatment efficacy. This article summarizes and gives the prospects of the application of artificial intelligence in the context of BT for cervical cancer.", "To commemorate 40\u00a0years since the founding of the Journal of Business Ethics, the editors in chief of the journal have invited the editors to provide commentaries on the future of business ethics. This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the theme Ethics at the centre of global and local challenges. For much of the history of the Journal of Business Ethics, ethics was seen within the academy as a peripheral aspect of business. However, in recent years, the stakes have risen dramatically, with global and local worlds destabilized by financial crisis, climate change, internet technologies and artificial intelligence, and global health crises. The authors of these commentaries address these grand challenges by placing business ethics at their centre. What if all grand challenges were framed as grand ethical challenges? Tanusree Jain, Arno Kourula and Suhaib Riaz posit that an ethical lens allows for a humble response, in which those with greater capacity take greater responsibility but remain inclusive and cognizant of different voices and experiences. Focussing on business ethics in connection to the grand(est) challenge of environmental emergencies, Steffen B\u00f6hm introduces the deceptively simple yet radical position that business is nature, and nature is business. His quick but profound side-step from arguments against human-nature dualism to an ontological undoing of the business-nature dichotomy should have all business ethics scholars rethinking their \"business and society\" assumptions. Also, singularly concerned with the climate emergency, Boudewijn de Bruin posits a scenario where, 40\u00a0years from now, our field will be evaluated by its ability to have helped humanity emerge from this emergency. He contends that Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth) v. Royal Dutch Shell illustrates how human rights take centre stage in climate change litigation, and how business ethics enters the courtroom. From a consumer ethics perspective, Deirdre Shaw, Michal Carrington and Louise Hassan argue that ecologically sustainable and socially just marketplace systems demand cultural change, a reconsideration of future interpretations of \"consumer society\", a challenge to the dominant \"growth logic\" and stimulation of alternative ways to address our consumption needs. Still concerned with global issues, but turning attention to social inequalities, Nelarine Cornelius links the capability approach (CA) to global and corporate governance, arguing that CA will continue to lie at the foundation of human development policy, and, increasingly, CSR and corporate governance. Continuing debate on the grand challenges associated with justice and equality, Laurence Romani identifies a significant shift in the centrality of business ethics in debates on managing (cultural) differences, positing that dialogue between diversity management and international management can ground future debate in business ethics. Finally, the essay concludes with a commentary by Charlotte Karam and Michelle Greenwood on the possibilities of feminist-inspired theories, methods, and positionality for many spheres of business ethics, not least stakeholder theory, to broaden and deepen its capacity for nuance, responsiveness, and transformation. In the words of our commentators, grand challenges must be addressed urgently, and the Journal of Business Ethics should be at the forefront of tackling them.", "To systematically collect basic data on nutrition and health of children aged 6-18 years in China.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in 7 regions, including Eastern China, Northern China, Central China, Southern China, Southwestern China, Northwestern China, and Northeastern China. A total of 65 000 children aged 6-18 years were selected from 28 urban and rural survey sites in 14 provinces through multistage stratified random cluster sampling. Through a questionnaire survey, physical examination, laboratory examination, dietary survey, children&apos;s information on dietary intake, physical development, bone development, psychological intelligence, physiological development, and physique were collected to evaluate children&apos;s nutrition and health status; nutrition and health knowledge, physical activity and lifestyle of children and their parents were investigated.\nThe project has basically completed the field investigation and data entry, and it has measured the physical development indicators of 64 999 children aged 6-18 years in China.64 463 completed the student questionnaire; 62 448 completed the body composition measurement, and 3359 completed the assessment of intellectual development.\nThis project brings together the nutrition, epidemiology, child care, mental health experts with the centers for disease control and prevention, and maternal and child health care system in our country. Combining with research institutes and children&apos;s hospitals of professional expertise, the project comprehensively collects children&apos;s dietary nutrition, growth and development, and health-related data in our country. It would put forward strategies to improve the children&apos;s nutrition and health in China and provide the basis for data sharing.", "Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may rarely occur in the context of genetic syndromes. So far, an association between obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) and ACTG1-associated Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome has not been described as yet. A thoroughly phenotyped patient with OCS and ACTG1-associated Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome is presented. The 25-year-old male patient was admitted to in-patient psychiatric care due to OCD. A whole-exome sequencing analysis was initiated as the patient also showed an autistic personality structure, below average intelligence measures, craniofacial dysmorphia signs, sensorineural hearing loss, and sinus cavernoma as well as subtle cardiac and ophthalmological alterations. The diagnosis of Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome type 2 was confirmed by the detection of a heterozygous likely pathogenic variant in the ACTG1 gene [c.1003C\u2009>\u2009T; p.(Arg335Cys), ACMG class 4]. The automated analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed changes in the orbitofrontal, parietal, and occipital cortex of both sides and in the right mesiotemporal cortex. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed intermittent rhythmic delta activity in the occipital and right temporal areas. Right mesiotemporal MRI and EEG alterations could be caused by a small brain parenchymal defect with hemosiderin deposits after a cavernomectomy. This paradigmatic case provides evidence of syndromic OCS in ACTG1-associated Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome. The MRI findings are compatible with a dysfunction of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops involved in OCD. If a common pathophysiology is confirmed in future studies, corresponding patients with Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome type 2 should be screened for OCS. The association may also contribute to a better understanding of OCD pathophysiology.", "Objective: To show the impact of problematic social media use (PSMU) on the 4 domains of emotional intelligence (emotional management, emotional awareness, social emotional awareness, and relationship management) among the Lebanese population. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 466 adults (January-May 2019). The Social Media Disorder Scale and Quick Emotional Intelligence Self-Assessment were used to assess problematic social media use and emotional intelligence, respectively. Results: Higher PSMU was significantly associated with lower emotional management scores (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.13), but not emotional awareness, social emotional awareness, relationship management, or total emotional intelligence scores. Female sex and older age were associated with higher social emotional awareness (\u03b2\u2009=\u20092.63 and \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.10, respectively) and relationship management (\u03b2\u2009=\u20092.12 and \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.13, respectively) scores. Conclusions: This study showed that higher PSMU was related to lower emotional intelligence. Future prospective studies are needed to gain an understanding of the relationship between PSMU and each component of emotional intelligence, as well as the mediating factors in such associations.", "Robotic surgery has changed the landscape of surgery and ushered in a new era of technology-assisted minimally invasive surgery. There is a paradigm shift from traditional open surgeries to minimal access surgery, with robotic surgery being the new standard of care in some surgical fields. This change comes with an unprecedented influx of innovations in technology related to minimal access surgery, robotics and artificial intelligence. Despite the exponential advances in technology, there is a lacuna in the training and credentialling of robotic surgeons. In India, no dedicated training curriculum exists for trainees in robotic surgery. Thus, as robotic surgery continues to develop in India, it is imperative that robust training and credentialing systems are in place to ensure that patient safety and surgical outcomes are not compromised.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is often presented as a transformative technology for clinical medicine even though the current technology maturity of AI is low. The purpose of this narrative review is to describe the complex reasons for the low technology maturity and set realistic expectations for the safe, routine use of AI in clinical medicine.\nFor AI to be productive in clinical medicine, many diverse factors that contribute to the low maturity level need to be addressed. These include technical problems such as data quality, dataset shift, black-box opacity, validation and regulatory challenges, and human factors such as a lack of education in AI, workflow changes, automation bias, and deskilling. There will also be new and unanticipated safety risks with the introduction of AI. The solutions to these issues are complex and will take time to discover, develop, validate, and implement. However, addressing the many problems in a methodical manner will expedite the safe and beneficial use of AI to augment medical decision making in psychiatry.", "Mediterranean diet (MD) can play a major role in decreasing the risks of non-communicable diseases and preventing overweight and obesity. In order for a person to follow the MD and assess their adherence to it, proper dietary assessment methods are required. We have developed an Artificial Intelligence-powered system that recognizes the food and drink items from a single meal photo and estimates their respective serving size, and integrated it into a smartphone application that automatically calculates MD adherence score and outputs a weekly feedback report. We compared the MD adherence score of four users as calculated by the system versus an expert dietitian, and the mean difference was 3.5% and statistically not significant. Afterwards, we conducted a feasibility study with 24 participants, to evaluate the system's performance and to gather the users' and dietitians' feedback. The image recognition system achieved 61.8% mean Average Precision for the testing set and 57.3% for the feasibility study images (where the ground truth was taken as the participants' annotations). The feedback from the participants of the feasibility study was also very positive.", "Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) is a fast MRI-based technique that allows for multiparametric quantitative characterization of the tissues of interest in a single acquisition. In particular, it has gained attention in the field of cardiac imaging due to its ability to provide simultaneous and co-registered myocardial T1 and T2 mapping in a single breath-held cardiac MRF scan, in addition to other parameters. Initial results in small healthy subject groups and clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of MRF imaging. Ongoing research is being conducted to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of cardiac MRF. However, these improvements usually increase the complexity of image reconstruction and dictionary generation and introduce the need for sequence optimization. Each of these steps increase the computational demand and processing time of MRF. The latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI), including progress in deep learning and the development of neural networks for MRI, now present an opportunity to efficiently address these issues. Artificial intelligence can be used to optimize candidate sequences and reduce the memory demand and computational time required for reconstruction and post-processing. Recently, proposed machine learning-based approaches have been shown to reduce dictionary generation and reconstruction times by several orders of magnitude. Such applications of AI should help to remove these bottlenecks and speed up cardiac MRF, improving its practical utility and allowing for its potential inclusion in clinical routine. This review aims to summarize the latest developments in artificial intelligence applied to cardiac MRF. Particularly, we focus on the application of machine learning at different steps of the MRF process, such as sequence optimization, dictionary generation and image reconstruction.", "Computer vision is the science that enables computers and machines to see and perceive image content on a semantic level. It combines concepts, techniques, and ideas from various fields such as digital image processing, pattern matching, artificial intelligence, and computer graphics. A computer vision system is designed to model the human visual system on a functional basis as closely as possible. Deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular which are biologically inspired have significantly contributed to computer vision studies. This research develops a computer vision system that uses CNNs and handcrafted filters from Log-Gabor filters to identify medicinal plants based on their leaf textural features in an ensemble manner. The system was tested on a dataset developed from the Centre of Plant Medicine Research, Ghana (MyDataset) consisting of forty-nine (49) plant species. Using the concept of transfer learning, ten pretrained networks including Alexnet, GoogLeNet, DenseNet201, Inceptionv3, Mobilenetv2, Restnet18, Resnet50, Resnet101, vgg16, and vgg19 were used as feature extractors. The DenseNet201 architecture resulted with the best outcome of 87% accuracy and GoogLeNet with 79% preforming the worse averaged across six supervised learning algorithms. The proposed model (OTAMNet), created by fusing a Log-Gabor layer into the transition layers of the DenseNet201 architecture achieved 98% accuracy when tested on MyDataset. OTAMNet was tested on other benchmark datasets; Flavia, Swedish Leaf, MD2020, and the Folio dataset. The Flavia dataset achieved 99%, Swedish Leaf 100%, MD2020 99%, and the Folio dataset 97%. A false-positive rate of less than 0.1% was achieved in all cases.", "This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence predictive model for predicting the probability of developing BM in CRC patients.\nFrom SEER database, 50,566 CRC patients were identified between January 2015 and December 2019 without missing data. SVM and LR models were trained and tested on the dataset. Accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and IDI were used to evaluate and compare the models.\nFor bone metastases in the entire cohort, SVM model with poly as kernel function presents the best performance, whose accuracy is 0.908, recall is 0.838, and AUC is 0.926, outperforming LR model. The top three most important factors affecting the model's prediction of BM include extraosseous metastases (EM), CEA, and size.\nOur study developed an SVM model with poly as kernel function for predicting BM in CRC patients.

Aim was to investigate the perspectives (knowledge, experience, and opinion) on AI in healthcare among patients with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, gastroenterologists, and GI-fellows. In this prospective questionnaire study 377 GI-patients, 35 gastroenterologists, and 45 GI-fellows participated. Of GI-patients, 62.5% reported to be familiar with AI and 25.0% of GI-physicians had work-related experience with AI. GI-patients preferred their physicians to use AI (mean 3.9) and GI-physicians were willing to use AI (mean 4.4, on 5-point Likert-scale). More GI-physicians believed in an increase in quality of care (81.3%) than GI-patients (64.9%, \u03c72(2)\u2009=\u20098.2, p\u2009=\u20090.017). GI-fellows expected AI implementation within 6.0\u00a0years, gastroenterologists within 4.2\u00a0years (t(76)\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20092.6, p\u2009=\u20090.011), and GI-patients within 6.1\u00a0years (t(193)\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20092.0, p\u2009=\u20090.047). GI-patients and GI-physicians agreed on the most important advantages of AI in healthcare: improving quality of care, time saving, and faster diagnostics and shorter waiting times. The most important disadvantage for GI-patients was the potential loss of personal contact, for GI-physicians this was insufficiently developed IT infrastructures. GI-patients and GI-physicians hold positive perspectives towards AI in healthcare. Patients were significantly more reserved compared to GI-fellows and GI-fellows were more reserved compared to gastroenterologists.", "In the vision of smart cities, everything is highly connected with the aid of computational intelligence. Therefore, the cyber-physical society has been named a computational social system for a long time. Due to the high relation with vast populations' national livelihood, agriculture will still serve as a core industry in the national economy. As a result, this study focused on an efficient forecasting method for the agriculture economy. In recent years, the conception of deep intelligence has received overall prevalence in academia because of its excellent performance in implementing intelligent information processing tasks. Hence, this paper utilized deep intelligence driven by neural networks and managed to investigate an efficient prediction method for the agriculture economy of computational social systems. To fit the time-series forecasting scene of the long-term development of the agriculture economy, the convolutional neural network model is slightly improved by revising its parallel structure into the recurrent format. Finally, simulations on realistic datasets are carried out to evaluate the proposed forecasting method.", "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a heterogeneous disease with many physiological implications. OSA is associated with a great diversity of diseases, with which it shares common and very often bidirectional pathophysiological mechanisms, leading to significantly negative implications on morbidity and mortality. In these patients, underdiagnosis of OSA is high. Concerning cardiorespiratory comorbidities, several studies have assessed the usefulness of simplified screening tests for OSA in patients with hypertension, COPD, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, morbid obesity, and in hospitalized elders.The key question is whether there is any benefit in the screening for the existence of OSA in patients with comorbidities. In this regard, there are few studies evaluating the performance of the various diagnostic procedures in patients at high risk for OSA. The purpose of this chapter is to review the existing literature about diagnosis in those diseases with a high risk for OSA, with special reference to artificial intelligence-related methods.", "Building an efficient and reliable small target motion detection visual system is challenging for artificial intelligence robotics because a small target only occupies few pixels and hardly displays visual features in images. Biological visual systems that have evolved over millions of years could be ideal templates for designing artificial visual systems. Insects benefit from a class of specialized neurons, called small target motion detectors (STMDs), which endow them with an excellent ability to detect small moving targets against a cluttered dynamic environment. Some bio-inspired models featured in feed-forward information processing architectures have been proposed to imitate the functions of the STMD neurons. However, feedback, a crucial mechanism for visual system regulation, has not been investigated deeply in the STMD-based neural circuits and its roles in small target motion detection remain unclear. In this paper, we propose a time-delay feedback STMD model for small target motion detection in complex backgrounds. The main contributions of this study are as follows. First, a feedback pathway is designed by transmitting information from output-layer neurons to lower-layer interneurons in the STMD pathway and the role of the feedback is analyzed from the view of mathematical analysis. Second, to estimate the feedback constant, the existence and uniqueness of solutions for nonlinear dynamical systems formed by feedback loop are analyzed via Schauder's fixed point theorem and contraction mapping theorem. Finally, an iterative algorithm is designed to solve the nonlinear problem and the performance of the proposed model is tested by experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the feedback is able to weaken background false positives while maintaining a minor effect on small targets. It outperforms existing STMD-based models regarding the accuracy of fast-moving small target detection in visual clutter. The proposed feedback approach could inspire the relevant modeling of robust motion perception robotics visual systems.", "In recent years, Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep-learning (DL) based methods, have been employed extensively to solve various problems in brachytherapy. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on recent developments and applications of AI/DL technologies for different areas in brachytherapy, including image enhancement, registration, segmentation, treatment planning, quality assurance, outcome prediction, etc. The review will emphasize studies addressing unique challenges in brachytherapy, as compared to external beam radiotherapy. Meanwhile, despite exciting achievements, it is also noted that we are still at the early stage of employing AI/DL-technologies to enhance brachytherapy clinical practice. Hence, this paper will also present challenges and future directions. We hope this review will inspire discussions on this topic and trigger future impactful studies to transform technology advancements into healthcare benefits.", "This paper aims to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that can help detect the stone that is most important to the diagnosis of urolithiasis. Among them, especially for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) models that support a final judgment in CDSS, we would like to study the optimal AI model by comparing and evaluating them.\nThis paper proposes the optimal ureter stone detection model using various AI technologies. The use of AI technology compares and evaluates methods such as machine learning (support vector machine), deep learning (ResNet-50, Fast R-CNN), and image processing (watershed) to find a more effective method for detecting ureter stones.\nThe final value of sensitivity, which is calculated using true positive (TP) and false negative and is a measure of the probability of TP results, showed high recognition accuracy, with an average value of 0.93 for ResNet-50. This finding confirmed that accurate guidance to the stones area was possible when the developed platform was used to support actual surgery.\nThe general situation in the most effective way to the detection stone can be found. But a variety of variables may be slightly different the difference through the term could tell. Future works, on urological diseases, are diverse and the research will be expanded by customizing AI models specialized for those diseases.", "Cognitive maps are assumed to be fundamentally spatial and grounded only in perceptual processes, as supported by the discovery of functionally dedicated cell types in the human brain, which tile the environment in a maplike fashion. Challenging this view, we demonstrate that spatial representations-such as large-scale geographical maps-can be as well retrieved with high confidence from natural language through cognitively plausible artificial-intelligence models on the basis of nonspatial associative-learning mechanisms. More critically, we show that linguistic information accounts for the specific distortions observed in tasks when college-age adults have to judge the geographical positions of cities, even when these positions are estimated on real maps. These findings indicate that language experience can encode and reproduce cognitive maps without the need for a dedicated spatial-representation system, thus suggesting that the formation of these maps is the result of a strict interplay between spatial- and nonspatial-learning principles.", "With the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, smart senior care has become a new trend for future development. The collection of \"Typical Cases of Chinese Elderly Service Industry Development\" is selected by the script materials. The main purpose of this article is to investigate how smart senior care can achieve value co-creation by grounded theory. This study explores the phenomenon of value co-creation in the participation of multiple actors in smart senior care services. Findings show that institutional guarantee, technical intake, market empowerment, emotional support, service interaction, and reciprocity norm are identified as the driving factors for value co-creation. In addition, the behavioral processes of value co-creation include multi-actor value consensus, co-creation environment establishment, practical value co-creation, public value sharing, and diffusion of service added value in smart senior care.

The overlap between various disorders results in difficulty when medical professionals attempt to interpret images. Artificial intelligence offers new tools for the evaluation and quantification of imaging of patients with diffuse lung disease.", "As robotic applications become increasingly diverse, more domains of human lives are being involved, now also extending to educational, therapeutic, and social situations, with a trend to even more complex interactions. This diversity generates new research questions that need to be met with an adequate infrastructure of psychological methods and theory. In this review, we illustrate the current lack of a sub-discipline in psychology to systematically study the psychological corollaries of living in societies where the application of robotic and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is becoming increasingly common. We thus propose that organized efforts be made toward recognition of robopsychology as a sub-discipline so that the field of psychology moves away from isolated publications of robot- and AI-related topics to a body of knowledge that is able to meet the demands for change, as the world is preparing for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We propose a definition of robopsychology that not only covers the study of the effects of robots on human behavior, but also of robots and AI themselves, as well as acknowledging how this sub-discipline may eventually be fundamentally changed through robots and AI. In this sense, our definition mirrors an already existing definition of the field of robophilosophy.", "Radiation oncology is a field that heavily relies on new technology.

A comprehensive search of databases including Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions and Cochrane will be conducted. The Distiller SR software will be used for manual screening all relevant articles. The selected articles will be analysed via R Bibliometrix, a program for mathematical analysis of large sets of literature, and VOSviewer, which creates visual representations of connections between articles.\nThis study did not require research ethics approval given the use of publicly available data and lack of human subjects. The results will be presented at scientific meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals.", "Visual body composition (VBC) estimates produced from smartphone-based artificial intelligence represent a user-friendly and convenient way to automate body composition remotely and without the inherent geographical and monetary restrictions of other body composition methods. However, there are limited studies that have assessed the reliability and agreement of this method and thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate VBC estimates compared to a 4-compartment (4C) criterion model.\nA variety of body composition assessments were conducted across 184 healthy adult participants (114\u00a0F, 70\u00a0M) including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and bioimpedance spectroscopy for utilization in the 4C model and automated assessments produced from two smartphone applications (Amazon Halo\u00ae, HALO; and myBVI\u00ae) using either Apple\u00ae or Samsung\u00ae phones. Body composition components were compared to a 4C model using equivalence testing, root mean square error (RMSE), and Bland-Altman analysis. Separate analyses by sex and racial/ethnic groups were conducted. Precision metrics were conducted for 183 participants using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), root mean squared coefficients of variation (RMS-%CV) and precision error (PE).\nOnly %fat produced from HALO devices demonstrated equivalence with the 4C model although mean differences for HALO were <\u00b11.0\u00a0kg for FM and FFM. RMSEs ranged from 3.9% to 6.2% for %fat and 3.1-5.2\u00a0kg for FM and FFM. Proportional bias was apparent for %fat across all VBC applications but varied for FM and FFM. Validity metrics by sex and specific racial/ethnic groups varied across applications. All VBC applications were reliable for %fat, fat mass (FM), and fat-free mass (FFM) with ICCs \u22650.99, RMS-%CV between 0.7% and 4.3%, and PEs between 0.3% and 0.6% for %fat and 0.2-0.5\u00a0kg for FM and FFM including assessments between smartphone types.\nSmartphone-based VBC estimates produce reliable body composition estimates but their equivalence with a 4C model varies by the body composition component being estimated and the VBC being employed. VBC estimates produced by HALO appear to have the lowest error, but proportional bias and estimates by sex and race vary across applications.", "Pharmacy intravenous admixture service (PIVAS) center has emerged as an important department of hospital as it can improve occupational protection and ensure the safety and effectiveness of intravenous infusions. However, medication errors were considered to be a significant challenge in PIVAS, so information-intelligence technologies were introduced to optimize the management of PIVAS. Our article summarized the application of information-intelligence technologies in PIVAS of a large third-class A hospital in China, and provided an example for PIVAS in other hospitals at home and abroad.\nPrescription-reviewing rules containing intravenous medications and infusion solution guideline were recorded in the database of prescription-cheking system. Drugs information were recorded in the PIVAS management system with special identification and warning labels to reduce intravenous infusion errors. Automatic labeling device was used to label the infusion bags, and the quality control program database of intelligent compounding robot for cytotoxic drugs was established ingeniously. Automatic sorting devices were applied for the third batch of finished infusion admixtures, and intelligent logistics robots were used to transport the infusion to the ward.\nAfter establishing and implementing of prescription-reviewing rules in the prescription-cheking system database, the number of prescriptions checked by pharmacists increased from 18 to 43 per minute. The success rate of intervention with irrational medical orders increased from 85.89% to 99.06% (P\u2009<\u20090.05). By introducing various intelligent devices, automatic labeling significantly enhanced work efficiency and reduced the error rate (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Furthermore, the use of intelligent intravenous compounding robots significantly reduced the risk of errors (P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nThe application of information-intelligence technologies in PIVAS can improve work efficiency and reduce error risk. However, some intelligent devices have failed to achieve the expected effect in practical use, and further improvements are needed to meet the demands of PIVAS in the future.", "Mobile technologies are being increasingly developed to support the practice of medicine, nursing, and public health, including HIV testing and prevention. Chatbots using artificial intelligence (AI) are novel mobile health strategies that can promote HIV testing and prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Malaysia, a hard-to-reach population at elevated risk of HIV, yet little is known about the features that are important to this key population.\nThe aim of this study was to identify the barriers to and facilitators of Malaysian MSM's acceptance of an AI chatbot designed to assist in HIV testing and prevention in relation to its perceived benefits, limitations, and preferred features among potential users.\nWe conducted 5 structured web-based focus group interviews with 31 MSM in Malaysia between July 2021 and September 2021. The interviews were first recorded, transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed using NVivo (version 9; QSR International). Subsequently, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology was used to guide data analysis to map emerging themes related to the barriers to and facilitators of chatbot acceptance onto its 4 domains: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and social influence.\nMultiple barriers and facilitators influencing MSM's acceptance of an AI chatbot were identified for each domain. Performance expectancy (ie, the perceived usefulness of the AI chatbot) was influenced by MSM's concerns about the AI chatbot's ability to deliver accurate information, its effectiveness in information dissemination and problem-solving, and its ability to provide emotional support and raise health awareness. Convenience, cost, and technical errors influenced the AI chatbot's effort expectancy (ie, the perceived ease of use). Efficient linkage to health care professionals and HIV self-testing was reported as a facilitating condition of MSM's receptiveness to using an AI chatbot to access HIV testing. Participants stated that social influence (ie, sociopolitical climate) factors influencing the acceptance of mobile technology that addressed HIV in Malaysia included privacy concerns, pervasive stigma against homosexuality, and the criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors. Key design strategies that could enhance MSM's acceptance of an HIV prevention AI chatbot included an anonymous user setting; embedding the chatbot in MSM-friendly web-based platforms; and providing user-guiding questions and options related to HIV testing, prevention, and treatment.\nThis study provides important insights into key features and potential implementation strategies central to designing an AI chatbot as a culturally sensitive digital health tool to prevent stigmatized health conditions in vulnerable and systematically marginalized populations. Such features not only are crucial to designing effective user-centered and culturally situated mobile health interventions for MSM in Malaysia but also illuminate the importance of incorporating social stigma considerations into health technology implementation strategies.", "It goes without saying that coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease and many countries are coping with its different variants. Owing to the limited medical facilities, vaccine and medical experts, need of the hour is to intelligently tackle its spread by making artificial intelligence (AI) based smart decisions for COVID-19 suspects who develop different symptoms and they are kept under observation and monitored to see the severity of the symptoms. The target of this study is to analyze COVID-19 suspects data and detect whether a suspect is a COVID-19 patient or not, and if yes, then to what extent, so that a suitable decision can be made. The decision can be categorized such that an infected person can be isolated or quarantined at home or at a facilitation center or the person can be sent to the hospital for the treatment. This target is achieved by designing a mathematical model of COVID-19 suspects in the form of a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model and a novel AI based technique is devised and implemented with the help of newly developed plithogenic distance and similarity measures in fuzzy environment. All findings are depicted graphically for a clear understanding and to provide an insight of the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed method.

It has the capability of exploring and identifying the most potent vaccine candidate in a limited period of time. The first successful novel approach of reverse vaccinology was observed in Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, which has revolutionised the whole field of computational biology. In this review, we have summarized the application of reverse vaccinology for different infectious diseases, discussed epitope prediction and various available bioinformatic tools, and explored the advantages, limitations and necessary elements of this approach. Some of the modifications in the reverse vaccinology approach, like pan-genome and comparative reverse vaccinology, are also outlined. Vaccines for illnesses like AIDS and hepatitis C have not yet been developed. Computer Aided Reverse vaccinology has the potential to be a game-changer in this area. The use of computational tools, pipelines and advanced soft-computing methods, such as artificial intelligence and deep learning, and exploitation of available omics data in integration have paved the way for speedy and effective vaccine designing. Is reverse vaccinology a viable option for developing vaccines against such infections, or is it a myth? Vaccine development gained momentum after the spread of various infections, resulting in numerous deaths; these vaccines are developed using the traditional technique, which includes inactivated microorganisms. As a result, reverse vaccinology may be a far superior technique for creating an effective vaccine.", "Artificial intelligence has rapidly grown and has made the scenario that no field can function without it. Like every field, it also plays a vital role in the sports field nowadays. In certain sports, injuries happen very often due to heavy training and sudden speedy actions, especially in athletics and football. Here arises a need to analyze the effect of physical training in sportsperson by collecting data from their daily training. With the help of artificial intelligence, a recurrent neural model is developed to analyze the effect of physical training and treatment concerning sports injury. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) can be a subsection of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that uses the neural nodes connected in a temporal sequence. The temporal sequence is one of the essential terms in this research, which denotes a data sequence of events in a given timeframe. The recurrent neural model is an intelligent machine learning method that comprises a neural schema replicating humans. This neural schema studies the data it collects from the athletes/players and processes it by analyzing previous injuries. Sports injuries have to be analyzed because, in some cases, it becomes more dangerous to the sportsperson that they may even lose their career due to disability. Sometimes it may cause a massive loss to the club or company that hired the sportsperson for the sport. The prediction process can give the player rest until he recovers, thus becoming the safest approach in sports. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the sportsperson's track data to keep an eye on his health. In this research, RNN model is compared with the existing Support Vector Machine (SVM) in concerning to the effect of physical training and treatment for sports. The results show that the proposed model has achieved 99% accuracy, which is higher than the existing algorithm.", "Real-world evidence from multinational disease registries is becoming increasingly important not only for confirming the results of randomised controlled trials, but also for identifying phenotypes, monitoring disease progression, predicting response to new drugs and early detection of rare side-effects. With new open-access technologies, it has become feasible to harmonise patient data from different disease registries and use it for data analysis without compromising privacy rules. Here, we provide a blueprint for how a clinical research collaboration can successfully use real-world data from existing disease registries to perform federated analyses. We describe how the European severe asthma clinical research collaboration SHARP (Severe Heterogeneous Asthma Research collaboration, Patient-centred) fulfilled the harmonisation process from nonstandardised clinical registry data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model and built a strong network of collaborators from multiple disciplines and countries. The blueprint covers organisational, financial, conceptual, technical, analytical and research aspects, and discusses both the challenges and the lessons learned. All in all, setting up a federated data network is a complex process that requires thorough preparation, but above all, it is a worthwhile investment for all clinical research collaborations, especially in view of the emerging applications of artificial intelligence and federated learning.", "Video question answering (Video-QA) is a subject undergoing intense study in Artificial Intelligence, which is one of the tasks which can evaluate such AI abilities. In this paper, we propose a Modality Attention Fusion framework with Hybrid Multi-head Self-attention (MAF-HMS). MAF-HMS focuses on the task of answering multiple-choice questions regarding a video-subtitle-QA representation by fusion of attention and self-attention between each modality. We use BERT to extract text features, and use Faster R-CNN to ex-tract visual features to provide a useful input representation for our model to answer questions. In addition, we have constructed a Modality Attention Fusion (MAF) framework for the attention fusion matrix from different modalities (video, subtitles, QA), and use a Hybrid Multi-headed Self-attention (HMS) to further determine the correct answer. Experiments on three separate scene datasets show our overall model outperforms the baseline methods by a large margin. Finally, we conducted extensive ablation studies to verify the various components of the network and demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method over existing methods through question type and required modality experimental results.", "The role of computational tools in the drug discovery and development process is becoming central, thanks to the possibility to analyze large amounts of data. The high throughput and affordability of current omics technologies, allowing quantitative measurements of many putative targets, has exponentially increased the volume of scientific data available. The quality of the data and the speed with which in silico predictions can be validated in vitro is instrumental in accelerating clinical laboratory medicine, significantly and substantially impacting Precision Medicine (PM). PM affords the basis to develop new drugs by providing a wide knowledge of the patient as an essential step towards individualized medicine. It is, therefore, essential to collect as much information and data as possible on each patient to identify the causes of the different responses to drugs from a pharmacogenomics perspective and to identify biological biomarkers capable of accurately describing the risk signals to develop specific diseases. Furthermore, the role of biomarkers in early drug discovery is increasing, as they can significantly reduce the time it takes to develop new drugs. This review article will discuss how Artificial Intelligence fits in the drug discovery pipeline, covering the benefits of an automated, integrated laboratory framework where the application of Machine Learning methodologies to interpret omics-based data can avail the future perspective of Translational Precision Medicine.", "To achieve minimum DNA input requirements for next-generation sequencing (NGS), pathologists visually estimate macrodissection and slide count decisions. Unfortunately, misestimation may cause tissue waste and increased laboratory costs. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented smart pathology review system (SmartPath) to empower pathologists with quantitative metrics for accurately determining tissue extraction parameters. SmartPath uses two deep learning architectures, a U-Net based network for cell segmentation and a multi-field-of-view convolutional network for tumor area segmentation, to extract features from digitized H&E-stained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded slides. From the segmented tumor area, SmartPath suggests a macrodissection area. To predict DNA yield per slide, the extracted features from within the macrodissection area are correlated with known DNA yields to fit a regularized linear model (R\u2009=\u20090.85). Then, a pathologist-defined target yield divided by the predicted DNA yield per slide gives the number of slides to scrape. Following model development, an internal validation trial was conducted within the Tempus Labs molecular sequencing laboratory. We evaluated our system on 501 clinical colorectal cancer slides, where half received SmartPath-augmented review and half traditional pathologist review. The SmartPath cohort had 25% more DNA yields within a desired target range of 100-2000\u2009ng. The number of extraction attempts was statistically unchanged between cohorts. The SmartPath system recommended fewer slides to scrape for large tissue sections, saving tissue in these cases. Conversely, SmartPath recommended more slides to scrape for samples with scant tissue sections, especially those with degraded DNA, helping prevent costly re-extraction due to insufficient extraction yield. A statistical analysis was performed to measure the impact of covariates on the results, offering insights on how to improve future applications of SmartPath. With these improvements, AI-augmented histopathologic review has the potential to decrease tissue waste, sequencing time, and laboratory costs by optimizing DNA yields, especially for samples with scant tissue and/or degraded DNA.", "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic and the consequent restrictions imposed worldwide have posed an unprecedented challenge to research and training in Parkinson's disease (PD). The pandemic has caused loss of productivity, reduced access to funding, an oft-acute switch to digital platforms, and changes in daily work protocols, or even redeployment. Frequently, clinical and research appointments were suspended or changed as a solution to limit the risk of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread and infection, but since the care and research in the field of movement disorders had traditionally been performed at in-person settings, the repercussions of the pandemic have even been more keenly felt in these areas. In this chapter, we review the implications of this impact on neurological research and training, with an emphasis on PD, as well as highlight lessons that can be learnt from how the Covid-19 pandemic has been managed in terms of restrictions in these crucial aspects of the neurosciences. One of the solutions brought to the fore has been to replace the traditional way of performing research and training with remote, and therefore socially distanced, alternatives. However, this has introduced fresh challenges in international collaboration, contingency planning, study prioritization, safety precautions, artificial intelligence, and various forms of digital technology. Nonetheless, in the long-term, these strategies will allow us to mitigate the adverse impact on PD research and training in future crises.", "Artificial intelligence now plays a significant role in both daily life and scientific research because of the rapid advancement of this technology in recent years. Making full use of the phrases in the translation phrase table for translation is challenging since the phrase matching is too accurate when the translation machine decodes. Fully automatic machine translation struggles to meet the expectations of its users since there are more or less translation faults brought on by data bottlenecks. Therefore, we require collaborative assisted translation technology for human-computer interaction. This work strengthens the research on collaborative translation techniques and ways for monitoring the human-computer interaction environment in order to further improve translation quality. This essay investigates and discusses human-computer translation techniques as well as related ideas in collaborative translation and human-computer interaction. The translation similarity model is incorporated into the translation system model together with an overall qualitative knowledge and logical reasoning capability of human-computer interaction to offer fresh strategies and methods for collaborative translation between humans and computers. According to the experimental findings, the accuracy rate of the collaborative translation system for human-computer interaction based on artificial intelligence technology can achieve 98.2% and 95.6%. The quality of the translation is enhanced after human-computer interaction, and the editing gap between the incorrect and auxiliary translations is narrowed, demonstrating the efficiency of the system and demonstrating its viability. In order to enhance the accuracy of system translation and the effectiveness of system operation, it is important to investigate the collaborative translation mode of human-computer interaction based on artificial intelligence technology.", "The diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases has experienced the era of open surgery and endovascular minimally invasive surgery. With the breakthrough of endovascular interventional robot, the rapid development of digitalization and informatization and the application of artificial intelligence, it will enter the era of precise, intelligent and minimally invasive surgery. This paper describes and provides new insights into the blueprint of diagnosis and treatment for vascular diseases in such era including three aspects: diagnosis and evaluation, endovascular treatment and postoperative treatment as well as follow-up.\n\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8bca\u6cbb\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u624b\u672f\u65f6\u4ee3\u3001\u8840\u7ba1\u8154\u5185\u5fae\u521b\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8840\u7ba1\u8154\u5185\u4ecb\u5165\u624b\u672f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5316\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c06\u6b65\u5165\u7cbe\u51c6\u667a\u80fd\u5fae\u521b\u65f6\u4ee3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u8840\u7ba1\u8154\u5185\u6cbb\u7597\u4ee5\u53ca\u672f\u540e\u6cbb\u7597\u4e0e\u968f\u8bbf\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5bf9\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u6cbb\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u667a\u80fd\u5fae\u521b\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u84dd\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5c55\u671b\u3002.", "During the operation of navigation satellites, errors in the broadcast ephemeris orbits are caused by the influence of ingress factors and other factors. To address this phenomenon, this paper examines the use of the computational intelligence (CI) methods to implement track correction and to develop an optimized BP neural network model based on an improved particle swarm algorithm. The model improves the inertia weights and learning factor parameters of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to improve the global optimization capability and accelerate the convergence speed. The improved PSO (IPSO) algorithm is used to perform a global optimization search for the hyperparameters of the BP neural network, and then the neural network model is trained by broadcast ephemeris Keplerian root number and regression parameters. The model is validated using the broadcast ephemeris data of the BDS-3 MEO and IGSO satellites, and the mean square error correction rate of multiple satellites with different correction models shows that the error correction rate of the IPSO-BPNN model can reach 70.2-84% and the error correction rate can be improved by 14.2-56.8% compared with the PSO-BPNN model. The proposed algorithm provides an important reference for BDS-3 and other global navigation satellite systems for improving the accuracy of satellite orbit determination.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is often heralded as a potential disruptor that will transform the practice of medicine. The amount of data collected and available in health care, coupled with advances in computational power, has contributed to advances in AI and an exponential growth of publications. However, the development of AI applications does not guarantee their adoption into routine practice. There is a risk that despite the resources invested, benefits for patients, staff, and society will not be realized if AI implementation is not better understood.\nThe aim of this study was to explore how the implementation of AI in health care practice has been described and researched in the literature by answering 3 questions: What are the characteristics of research on implementation of AI in practice? What types and applications of AI systems are described? What characteristics of the implementation process for AI systems are discernible?\nA scoping review was conducted of MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases to identify empirical studies of AI implementation in health care since 2011, in addition to snowball sampling of selected reference lists. Using Rayyan software, we screened titles and abstracts and selected full-text articles. Data from the included articles were charted and summarized.\nOf the 9218 records retrieved, 45 (0.49%) articles were included. The articles cover diverse clinical settings and disciplines; most (32/45, 71%) were published recently, were from high-income countries (33/45, 73%), and were intended for care providers (25/45, 56%). AI systems are predominantly intended for clinical care, particularly clinical care pertaining to patient-provider encounters. More than half (24/45, 53%) possess no action autonomy but rather support human decision-making. The focus of most research was on establishing the effectiveness of interventions (16/45, 35%) or related to technical and computational aspects of AI systems (11/45, 24%). Focus on the specifics of implementation processes does not yet seem to be a priority in research, and the use of frameworks to guide implementation is rare.\nOur current empirical knowledge derives from implementations of AI systems with low action autonomy and approaches common to implementations of other types of information systems. To develop a specific and empirically based implementation framework, further research is needed on the more disruptive types of AI systems being implemented in routine care and on aspects unique to AI implementation in health care, such as building trust, addressing transparency issues, developing explainable and interpretable solutions, and addressing ethical concerns around privacy and data protection.", "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are common subepithelial lesions (SELs) and require treatment considering their malignant potential. We recently developed an endoscopic ultrasound-based artificial intelligence (EUS-AI) system to differentiate GISTs from non-GISTs in gastric SELs, which were used to train the system. We assessed whether the EUS-AI system designed for diagnosing gastric GISTs could be applied to non-gastric GISTs. Between January 2015 and January 2021, 52 patients with non-gastric SELs (esophagus, n\u2009=\u200915; duodenum, n\u2009=\u200926; colon, n\u2009=\u200911) were enrolled. The ability of EUS-AI to differentiate GISTs from non-GISTs in non-gastric SELs was examined. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of EUS-AI for discriminating GISTs from non-GISTs in non-gastric SELs were 94.4%, 100%, and 86.1%, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.98 based on the cutoff value set using the Youden index. In the subanalysis, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of EUS-AI were highest in the esophagus (100%, 100%, 100%; duodenum, 96.2%, 100%, 0%; colon, 90.9%, 100%, 0%); the cutoff values were determined using the Youden index or the value determined using stomach cases. The diagnostic accuracy of EUS-AI increased as lesion size increased, regardless of lesion location. EUS-AI based on gastric SELs had good diagnostic ability for non-gastric GISTs.", "The combination of \"Big Data\" and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is frequently promoted as having the potential to deliver valuable health benefits when applied to medical decision-making. However, the responsible adoption of AI-based clinical decision support systems faces several challenges at both the individual and societal level. One of the features that has given rise to particular concern is the issue of explainability, since, if the way an algorithm arrived at a particular output is not known (or knowable) to a physician, this may lead to multiple challenges, including an inability to evaluate the merits of the output. This \"opacity\" problem has led to questions about whether physicians are justified in relying on the algorithmic output, with some scholars insisting on the centrality of explainability, while others see no reason to require of AI that which is not required of physicians. We consider that there is merit in both views but find that greater nuance is necessary in order to elucidate the underlying function of explainability in clinical practice and, therefore, its relevance in the context of AI for clinical use. In this paper, we explore explainability by examining what it requires in clinical medicine and draw a distinction between the function of explainability for the current patient versus the future patient. This distinction has implications for what explainability requires in the short and long term. We highlight the role of transparency in explainability, and identify semantic transparency as fundamental to the issue of explainability itself. We argue that, in day-to-day clinical practice, accuracy is sufficient as an \"epistemic warrant\" for clinical decision-making, and that the most compelling reason for requiring explainability in the sense of scientific or causal explanation is the potential for improving future care by building a more robust model of the world. We identify the goal of clinical decision-making as being to deliver the best possible outcome as often as possible, and find-that accuracy is sufficient justification for intervention for today's patient, as long as efforts to uncover scientific explanations continue to improve healthcare for future patients.", "The aim of this work is to explore the influencing factors of nurses' caring behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation as determinants of Behaviour (COM-B) theoretical framework.\nNurse caring behaviour is vital to reduce and speed up the healing process of COVID-19 patients. It is important to understand the factors that influence caring behaviour among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research suggests that when it comes to understanding behaviour, using a theoretical framework is likely to be most effective, and the COM-B framework is a recommended approach.\nSemistructured interviews with 42 nurses working in 11 Chinese cities were conducted, and their verbatim statements were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. The results were mapped to COM-B framework.\nTen key themes emerged: Capability (professional knowledge and skills, emotional intelligence, cross-cultural care competence); opportunity (resources, organizational culture, social culture); motivation (past experience, character, role, beliefs).\nTen factors were found to influence nurses' caring behaviour. This study added two new influencing factors, social culture and past experiences, that further contributed to the understanding of nurses' care behaviours.\nNurses' caring behaviour is influenced not only by themselves but also by institutions and society, so interventions aiming to improve their caring behaviour should consider these elements. The negative impact of the pandemic on capability factors that influence nurses' caring behaviour should be counteracted as soon as possible.", "Early detection and prediction of suicidal behaviour are key factors in suicide control. In conjunction with recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, there is increasing research into how machine learning can assist in the detection, prediction and treatment of suicidal behaviour. Therefore, this study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the literature exploring machine learning techniques in the study of suicidal behaviour prediction.\nA search of four databases was conducted: Web of Science, PubMed, Dimensions, and Scopus for research papers dated between January 2016 and September 2021. The search keywords are 'data mining', 'machine learning' in combination with 'suicidal behaviour', 'suicide', 'suicide attempt', 'suicidal ideation', 'suicide plan' and 'self-harm'. The studies that used machine learning techniques were synthesized according to the countries of the articles, sample description, sample size, classification tasks, number of features used to develop the models, types of machine learning techniques, and evaluation of performance metrics.\nThirty-five empirical articles met the criteria to be included in the current review. We provide a general overview of machine learning techniques, examine the feature categories, describe methodological challenges, and suggest areas for improvement and research directions. Ensemble prediction models have been shown to be more accurate and useful than single prediction models.\nMachine learning has great potential for improving estimates of future suicidal behaviour and monitoring changes in risk over time. Further research can address important challenges and potential opportunities that may contribute to significant advances in suicide prediction.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has proven time and time again to be a game-changer innovation in every walk of life, including medicine. Introduced by Dr. Gunn in 1976 to accurately diagnose acute abdominal pain and list potential differentials, AI has since come a long way. In particular, AI has been aiding in radiological diagnoses with good sensitivity and specificity by using machine learning algorithms. With the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, AI has proven to be more than just a tool to facilitate healthcare workers in decision making and limiting physician-patient contact during the pandemic. It has guided governments and key policymakers in formulating and implementing laws, such as lockdowns and travel restrictions, to curb the spread of this viral disease. This has been made possible by the use of social media to map severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 hotspots, laying the basis of the \"smart lockdown\" strategy that has been adopted globally. However, these benefits might be accompanied with concerns regarding privacy and unconsented surveillance, necessitating authorities to develop sincere and ethical government-public relations.", "The development of intelligent blood coagulation diagnoses is awaited to meet the current need for large clinical time-sensitive caseloads due to its efficient and automated diagnoses. Herein, a method is reported and validated to realize it through artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted optical clotting biophysics (OCB) properties identification. The image differential calculation is used for precise acquisition of OCB properties with elimination of initial differences, and the strategy of space-time regulation allows on-demand space time OCB properties identification and enables diverse blood function diagnoses. The integrated applications of smartphones and cloud computing offer a user-friendly automated analysis for accurate and convenient diagnoses. The prospective assays of clinical cases (n\u00a0= 41) show that the system realizes 97.6%, 95.1%, and 100% accuracy for coagulation factors, fibrinogen function, and comprehensive blood coagulation diagnoses, respectively. This method should enable more low-cost and convenient diagnoses and provide a path for potential diagnostic-markers finding.", "This core component of the Diabetes RElated to Acute pancreatitis and its Mechanisms (DREAM) study will examine the hypothesis that advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can reflect underlying pathophysiologic changes and provide imaging biomarkers that predict diabetes mellitus (DM) after acute pancreatitis (AP). A subset of participants in the DREAM study will enroll and undergo serial MRI examinations using a specific research protocol. The aim of the study is to differentiate at-risk individuals from those who remain euglycemic by identifying parenchymal features after AP. Performing longitudinal MRI will enable us to observe and understand the natural history of post-AP DM. We will compare MRI parameters obtained by interrogating tissue properties in euglycemic, prediabetic, and incident diabetes subjects and correlate them with metabolic, genetic, and immunological phenotypes. Differentiating imaging parameters will be combined to develop a quantitative composite risk score. This composite risk score will potentially have the ability to monitor the risk of DM in clinical practice or trials. We will use artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning, algorithms to optimize the predictive ability of MRI. In addition to the research MRI, the DREAM study will also correlate clinical computed tomography and MRI scans with DM development.", "Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, with limited early screening methods and poor prognosis. Artificial intelligence technology has made a great breakthrough in cancer diagnosis.\nWe aim to develop a specific interpretable machine learning (ML) prediction model for the diagnosis and prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) based on a variety of biomarkers.\nA total of 521 patients with EOC and 144 patients with benign gynecological diseases were enrolled including derivation datasets and an external validation cohort. The predicted information was acquired by 9 supervised ML methods, through 34 parameters. Behind predicted reasons for the best ML were improved by using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm. In addition, the prognosis of EOC was analyzed by unsupervised clustering and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis.\nML technology was superior to conventional logistic regression in predicting EOC diagnosis and XGBoost performed best in the external validation datasets. The AUC values of distinguishing EOC and benign disease patients, determining pathological type, grade and clinical stage were 0.958 (0.926-0.989), 0.792 (0.701-0.8834), 0.819 (0.687-0.950) and 0.68 (0.573-0.788) respectively. For negative CA-125 EOC patients, the AUC performance of XGBoost model was 0.835(0.763-0.907). We used unsupervised cluster analysis to identify EOC subgroups with significantly poor overall survival (p-value <0.0001) and recurrence-free survival (p-value <0.0001).\nBased on the preoperative characteristics, we proved that ML algorithm can provide an acceptable diagnosis and prognosis prediction model for EOC patients. Meanwhile, SHAP analysis can improve the interpretability of ML models and contribute to precision medicine.", "This review highlights the artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning initiatives supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Eye Institute (NEI) and calls attention to activities and goals defined in the NEI Strategic Plan as well as opportunities for future activities and breakthroughs in ophthalmology.\nOphthalmology is at the forefront of artificial intelligence-based innovations in biomedical research that may lead to improvement in early detection and surveillance of ocular disease, prediction of progression, and improved quality of life. Technological advances have ushered in an era where unprecedented amounts of information can be linked that enable scientific discovery. However, there remains an unmet need to collect, harmonize, and share data in a machine actionable manner. Similarly, there is a need to ensure that efforts promote health and research equity by expanding diversity in the data and workforce.\nThe NIH/NEI has supported the development artificial intelligence-based innovations to advance biomedical research. The NIH/NEI has defined activities to achieve these goals in the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science and the NEI Strategic Plan and have spearheaded initiatives to facilitate research in these areas.", "Compared to traditional rigid-bodied robots, soft robots are constructed using physically flexible/elastic bodies and electronics to mimic nature and enable novel applications in industry, healthcare, aviation, military, etc. Recently, the fabrication of robots on soft matter with great flexibility and compliance has enabled smooth and sophisticated 'multi-degree-of-freedom' 3D actuation to seamlessly interact with humans, other organisms and non-idealized environments in a highly complex and controllable manner. Herein, we summarize the fabrication approaches, driving strategies, novel applications, and future trends of soft robots. Firstly, we introduce the different fabrication approaches to prepare soft robots and compare and systematically discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Then, we present the actuator-based and material-based driving strategies of soft robotics and their characteristics. The representative applications of soft robotics in artificial intelligence, medicine, sensors, and engineering are summarized. Also, some remaining challenges and future perspectives in soft robotics are provided. This work highlights the recent advances of soft robotics in terms of functional material selection, structure design, control strategies and biomimicry, providing useful insights into the development of next-generation functional soft robotics.", "Pedestrian detection and tracking based on computer vision has gradually become an international pattern recognition, which is one of the most active research topics in the field of computer vision and artificial intelligence. Using the theoretical results in the field of pattern recognition and computer vision technology, we are committed to detect and track pedestrians from video sequences. In addition to computer vision-based passer-by detection and tracking technology as the key, in the advanced computer vision action and analysis, it has a direct impact on the accuracy and robustness of its understanding. We analyzed various targets, such as subsequent recognition motion and pedestrian motion, and described them as high-level application processing, such as action understanding. In addition, because of the unique texture of human clothes compared with the surrounding natural landscape, they are highly \"prominent\" from the perspective of human visual system, and they are particularly prominent in the peripheral part of human contact with the background. In this paper, a binary function based on importance is proposed. As the space representation of image itself is not sensitive to noise and local signal, space representation is used. In addition, as an observation model, it can reduce the adverse effects of background noise and local noise on the tracking algorithm. Through the function block tracking, the pedestrian's body can be tracked in detail. At the same time, the color band learning method is used to update the target template online to deal with the changes of target appearance caused by sunshine, pedestrian posture, and other factors. According to the experimental results, even if the appearance and posture of pedestrians change greatly, it has a stable tracking effect.", "The increasing use of machine learning (ML) algorithms in clinical settings raises concerns about bias in ML models. Bias can arise at any step of ML creation, including data handling, model development, and performance evaluation. Potential biases in the ML model can be minimized by implementing these steps correctly. This report focuses on performance evaluation and discusses model fitness, as well as a set of performance evaluation toolboxes: namely, performance metrics, performance interpretation maps, and uncertainty quantification. By discussing the strengths and limitations of each toolbox, our report highlights strategies and considerations to mitigate and detect biases during performance evaluations of radiology artificial intelligence models.

Thus, this cross-sectional study was focused on analyzing the progress in the use of AI in CLD.\nRegistered trials of AI applied in CLD on ClinicalTrials.gov were searched firstly. All available information was downloaded to Excel (Microsoft Excel, Rong, Rong, China), and duplicates were removed. We extracted the data of the included trials, then analyzed the characteristics of them finally.\nUp to the 27th of May 2021, 6835 trials were identified following an initial search, and 20 registered trials were included after screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among those trials, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, 40.0%) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD, 20.0%) were the most widely applied CLDs for AI. Trials started in 2013 until 2021, with 17 trials (85%) registered after 2016. There was a large trend in trial enrolment, with 40% of them including samples more than 500. Five trials (25%) have been completed, but only one of these had available results. The most frequent sponsors and collaborators were both hospitals at 55%, followed by universities at 35% and institutes at 11%, respectively. Of the 20 trials included, 35% (7 trials) were interventional trials and 65% (13 trials) were observational trials. Among 7 interventional trials, most trials were for diagnosis purpose (42.86%, 3 trials); 4 trials (57.14%) were randomized; 3 trials (42.86%) applied behavioral intervention, 1 trial (14.29%) was in device intervention, 2 trials (28.57%) were in diagnostic test, and 1 trial intervention was unknown. Among 13 observational trials, 8 (61.54%) were cohort studies; 6 (46.15%) were prospective studies, 4 (30.77%) were retrospective studies, 2 (15.38%) were cross-sectional studies, and 1 (7.69%) did not involve a temporal perspective.\nThe study is the first to focus on AI registration trials in CLD, which will aid relevant scholars in understanding the current state of the subject. This study demonstrates that additional research on AI used in the diagnosis and treatment of CLD is required, and timely publication of accessible results from registered trials is essential.", "This work presents the application of droplet-based microfluidics for the cultivation of microspores from Brassica napus using the doubled haploid technology. Under stress conditions (e.g. heat shock) or by chemical induction a certain fraction of the microspores can be reprogrammed and androgenesis can be induced. This process is an important approach for plant breeding because desired plant properties can be anchored in the germline on a genetic level. However, the reprogramming rate of the microspores is generally very low, increasing it by specific stimulation is, therefore, both a necessary and challenging task. In order to accelerate the optimisation and development process, the application of droplet-based microfluidics can be a promising tool. Here, we used a tube-based microfluidic system for the generation and cultivation of microspores inside nL-droplets. Different factors like cell density, tube material and heat shock conditions were investigated to improve the yield of vital plant organoids. Evaluation and analysis of the stimuli response were done on an image base aided by an artificial intelligence cell detection algorithm. Droplet-based microfluidics allowed us to apply large concentration programs in small test volumes and to screen the best conditions for reprogramming cells by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A and for enhancing the yield of vital microspores in droplets. An enhanced reprogramming rate was found under the heat shock conditions at 32 \u00b0C for about 3 to 6 days. In addition, the comparative experiment with MTP showed that droplet cultivation with lower cell density (<10 cells per droplet) or adding media after 3 or 6 days significantly positively affects the microspore growth and embryo rate inside 120 nL droplets. Finally, the developed embryos could be removed from the droplets and further grown into mature plants. Overall, we demonstrated that the droplet-based tube system is suitable for implementation in an automated, miniaturized system to achieve the induction of embryogenic development in haploid microspore stem cells of Brassica napus.", "Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most common diseases in neonates and predominantly affects premature or very-low-birth-weight infants. Diagnosis is difficult and needed in hours since the first symptom onset for the best therapeutic effects. Artificial intelligence (AI) may play a significant role in NEC diagnosis. A literature search on the use of AI in the diagnosis of NEC was performed. Four databases (PubMed, Embase, arXiv, and IEEE Xplore) were searched with the appropriate MeSH terms. The search yielded 118 publications that were reduced to 8 after screening and checking for eligibility. Of the eight, five used classic machine learning (ML), and three were on the topic of deep ML. Most publications showed promising results. However, no publications with evident clinical benefits were found. Datasets used for training and testing AI systems were small and typically came from a single institution. The potential of AI to improve the diagnosis of NEC is evident. The body of literature on this topic is scarce, and more research in this area is needed, especially with a focus on clinical utility. Cross-institutional data for the training and testing of AI algorithms are required to make progress in this area. IMPACT: Only a few publications on the use of AI in NEC diagnosis are available although they offer some evidence that AI may be helpful in NEC diagnosis. AI requires large, multicentre, and multimodal datasets of high quality for model training and testing. Published results in the literature are based on data from single institutions and, as such, have limited generalisability. Large multicentre studies evaluating broad datasets are needed to evaluate the true potential of AI in diagnosing NEC in a clinical setting.", "Transfusion-associated hyperkalemia (TAH) is a potentially life-threatening complication of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Previously, we reported features of RBC transfusions from 35 pediatric patients (TAH group) who had hyperkalemia with RBC transfusion in one-year period at four facilities. In this study, we used multivariate analyses and artificial intelligence to compare the TAH group to newly collected control group (non-TAH group) to identify factors associated with TAH occurrence.\nA review of RBC transfusion with TAH was compared to non-TAH group who did not develop TAH with RBC transfusion at each facility during the same one-year period. The non-TAH group included 12 patients each in 5 age groups. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests recursive feature elimination, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator (LASSO), and other artificial intelligence techniques were employed to identify the most salient features associated with predicting specific clinical outcomes for TAH occurrence.\nPre-transfusion creatinine, comorbidities of kidney and/or liver dysfunctions, and total transfused volume within 12\u2009h (tV-12) per kg and per estimated total blood volume (eTBV) showed statistically significant differences between TAH and non-TAH groups. Multivariate analysis revealed the biggest factor in TAH occurrence was tV-12/kg followed by age of RBC units. The thresholds of risks were tV-12/kg of 30\u2009ml/kg, tV-12/eTBV of 30%, and RBC unit age of 7.95\u2009days.\nThe study findings suggest that the biggest factor on TAH occurrence is tV-12/kg. More importantly, 30% of eTBV transfusion could cause TAH in patients with multiple comorbidities.", "There are a lot of environmental protection musicals and dances in public entertainment life to support the concept of environmental protection and to entice people to support the cause of environmental protection. As we all know, in a musical performance, the distance between the audience and the actors, the design of the stage environment, the training of the actors, the costumes of the actors, the makeup of the actors, and the musical accompaniment will all have more or less influence on the stage performance effects. In order to make environmental protection music and dance dramas profoundly meaningful to social production and human activities, it is especially important to analyze the stage performance of such music and dance dramas. The analysis of stage performance effects is not only beneficial to making the ideas spread by the music and dance drama penetrate into people's hearts but can also provide guiding suggestions for the production of music and dance drama. Therefore, this paper proposes a linear regression algorithm based on artificial intelligence to deeply explore and analyze the influence of the above six factors on the stage performance effects of environmental protection music and dance drama. In our method, first we preprocess the data collected by classification to remove the odd values from the data so that the various types of data conform to a normal distribution. Secondly, we obtained linear fit plots of the six factors with the stage performance effect scores by using a linear regression algorithm to deeply analyze the correlation between various types of data and the stage performance effect scores. Finally, through numerical calculations, we found that the distance between the audience and the actors, the training of the actors, and the musical accompaniment have a greater influence on the performance effect of the musical cabaret in the environmental protection category. Meanwhile, the costumes of the actors, the makeup of the actors, and the design of the stage environment have less influence on the performance effect of the musical cabaret. Therefore, in the production and performance of environmental protection music and dance dramas, producers and performers should pay more attention to the distance between the audience and the actors, the design of musical accompaniment, and the training of actors. To sum up, this paper has made a scientific, detailed, and reasonable analysis of the performance effect of environmental protection music and dance dramas on stage, contributing to the dissemination of environmental protection ideas.", "Leadership psychology among college students is a multidimensional concept that primarily encompasses practical ability, teamwork ability, political literacy, emotional intelligence, etc. At present, a common problem among the surveyed college students is their leadership ability is not strong. Reasons include the lack of leadership-related knowledge and leadership awareness among college students as well as the fact that the public, particularly college educators, do not give leadership training a sufficient attention. Leadership psychology is a primary factor influencing the development of college students. It is necessary to strengthen college students' leadership education. This work extracts the key factors that influence the leadership of college students by analyzing their big behavior data. The extracted factors include the theoretical knowledge of leadership, practical ability, leadership psychology, home education, and exercise. To evaluate the degrees of these factors influencing the students' leadership, we develop an advanced multicriteria decision-making framework based on the ENtropy theory and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), called EN-TOPSIS. In EN-TOPSIS, an entropy method is used to determine the criteria weights rather than using the subjective weighting method. Three groups of college students are surveyed and evaluated based on the five factors. Each group contains ten students. The evaluation results show that the leadership of the students is mainly influenced by their practical ability and leadership psychology. The students with the highest evaluation score are recognized as having high levels of leadership.", "Ultrasonography (US) is the most common method of identifying thyroid nodules, but US images require an experienced surgeon for identification. Many artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as computer-aided diagnostic systems (CAD), deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) have been used to assist in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, but whether AI techniques can improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid nodules still needs to be explored.\nTo clarify the accuracy of AI-based thyroid nodule US images for differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules.\nA search strategy of \"subject terms\u2009+\u2009key words\" was used to search PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine (CBM), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for studies on AI-assisted diagnosis of thyroid nodules based on US images. The summarized receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and the pooled sensitivity and specificity were used to assess the performance of the diagnostic tests. The quality assessment of diagnostics accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. The Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 15 were used to process the data. Subgroup analysis was based on the integrity of data collection.\nA total of 25 studies with 17,429 US images of thyroid nodules were included. AI-assisted diagnostic techniques had better diagnostic efficacy in the diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules: sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI: (0.85-0.90)), specificity 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74-0.86), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) 30 (95% CI: 19-46). The SROC curve indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-0.94). Threshold effect analysis showed a Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.17\u2009<\u20090.5, suggesting no threshold effect for the included studies. After a meta-regression analysis of 4 different subgroups, the results showed a statistically significant effect of mean age \u226550 years on heterogeneity. Compared with studies with an average age of \u226550 years, AI-assisted diagnostic techniques had higher diagnostic performance in studies with an average age of <50 years (0.89 (95% CI: 0.87-0.92) vs. 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73-0.88)), (0.83 (95% CI: 0.77-0.88) vs. 0.73 (95% CI: 0.60-0.87)).\nAI-assisted diagnostic techniques had good diagnostic efficacy for thyroid nodules. For the diagnosis of <50 year olds, AI-assisted diagnostic technology was more effective in diagnosis.", "A limitation to expanding laparoscopic simulation training programs is the scarcity of expert evaluators. In 2019, a new digital platform for remote and asynchronous laparoscopic simulation training was validated. Through this platform, 369 trainees have been trained in 14 institutions across Latin America, collecting 6729 videos of laparoscopic training exercises. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has recently emerged in surgical simulation, showing usefulness in training assessment, virtual reality scenarios, and laparoscopic virtual reality simulation. An AI algorithm to assess basic laparoscopic simulation training exercises was developed. This study aimed to analyze the agreement between this AI algorithm and expert evaluators in assessing basic laparoscopic-simulated training exercises.\nThe AI algorithm was trained using 400-bean drop (BD) and 480-peg transfer (PT) videos and tested using 64-BD and 43-PT randomly selected videos, not previously used to train the algorithm. The agreement between AI and expert evaluators from the digital platform (EE) was then analyzed. The exercises being assessed involve using laparoscopic graspers to move objects across an acrylic board without dropping any objects in a determined time (BD\u2009<\u200924\u00a0s, PT\u2009<\u200955\u00a0s). The AI algorithm can detect object movement, identify if objects have fallen, track grasper clamps location, and measure exercise time. Cohen's Kappa test was used to evaluate the agreement between AI assessments and those performed by EE, using a pass/fail nomenclature based on the time to complete the exercise.\nAfter the algorithm was trained, 79.69% and 93.02% agreement were observed in BD and PT, respectively. The Kappa coefficients test observed for BD and PT were 0.59 (moderate agreement) and 0.86 (almost perfect agreement), respectively.\nThis first approach of AI use in basic laparoscopic skills simulated training assessment shows promising results, providing a preliminary framework to expand the use of AI to other basic laparoscopic skills exercises.", "Sedative gastrointestinal endoscopy is extensively used worldwide. An appropriate degree of sedation leads to more acceptability and satisfaction. Artificial intelligence has rapidly developed in the field of digestive endoscopy in recent years and we have constructed a mature computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. This system can identify the remaining parts to be examined in real-time endoscopic procedures, which may help anesthetists use anesthetics properly to keep patients in an appropriate degree of sedation.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effects of the CAD system on anesthesia quality control during gastrointestinal endoscopy.\nWe recruited 154 consecutive patients at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, including 76 patients in the CAD group and 78 in the control group. Anesthetists in the CAD group were able to see the CAD system's indications, while anesthetists in the control group could not. The primary outcomes included emergence time (from examination completion to spontaneous eye opening when doctors called the patients' names), recovery time (from examination completion to achievement of the primary recovery endpoints) and patient satisfaction scores. The secondary outcomes included anesthesia induction time (from sedative administration to successful sedation), procedure time (from scope insertion to scope withdrawal), total dose of propofol, vital signs, etc. This trial was registered in the Primary Registries of the WHO Registry Network, with registration number ChiCTR2100042621.\nEmergence time in the CAD group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The recovery time was also significantly shorter in the CAD group (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Patients in the CAD group were significantly more satisfied with their sedation than those in control group (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Vital signs were stable during the examinations in both groups. Propofol doses during the examinations were comparable between the two groups.\nThis CAD system possesses great potential for anesthesia quality control. It can improve patient satisfaction during endoscopic examinations with sedation.\nChiCTR2100042621.", "In recent years, college students' psychological problems have occurred frequently, and the early warning of college students' psychological crisis has received social attention. Artificial intelligence and big data, as emerging technologies that have attracted much attention in recent years, have broad application and development space in improving the development of intelligent and refined education in colleges and universities. Applying artificial intelligence and big data to the practice of college students' mental health education plays a very positive role in accurately finding and scientifically solving college students' mental health problems. This paper combs the current application and research of artificial intelligence and big data in college students' mental health education and then clarifies the problems existing in the practical application. Finally, on the basis of in-depth analysis of the characteristics of college students' psychological crisis, the paper designs college students' psychological crisis early warning data collection system from six aspects, including the educational administration system and the access control system. And from the aspects of establishing a multilevel linkage feedback early warning system, building a team of big data technical personnel and mental health education personnel, it puts forward countermeasures for college students' psychological crisis, so as to provide theoretical and methodological support for college mental health management.", "Osteoporosis is an age-related disorder that is characterized by reduced bone mass. Its prevention and treatment are important healthcare issues for maintaining social activity in aged societies. Although bone fractures mostly occur at sites of weakened cortical bone, pathophysiological and pharmacological evaluations of bone mass have tended to be predominantly assessed in trabecular bone. To statistically characterize cortical bone remodeling, we originally established multimode fluorescence imaging and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven morphometric analyses in six-month-old female rabbits with well-defined cortical remodeling, similar to that in humans. We evaluated three distinct administration frequencies of teriparatide [TPTD; human parathyroid hormone, hPTH (1-34)]: once (1/w), twice (2/w), and seven times (7/w) a week, with the same total dose (140\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/week). Our analyses revealed significant expansions of the osteocytic lacunar-canalicular system and Haversian canals accompanied by the development of cortical porosity and endosteal na\u00efve bone formation induced by a frequent administration regimen (7/w) of TPTD; however, once-weekly (1/w) and twice-weekly (2/w) administration of TPTD showed little effect. These findings demonstrate a clear contrast between the effects of frequent and infrequent administration of TPTD on cortical bone metabolism and suggest that osteocytic bone remodeling is involved in the pharmacological action of PTH.", "Design and evaluate a knowledge-based model using commercially available artificial intelligence tools for automated treatment planning to efficiently generate clinically acceptable hippocampal avoidance prophylactic cranial irradiation (HA-PCI) plans in patients with small-cell lung cancer.\nData from 44 patients with different grades of head flexion (range 45\u00b0) were used as the training datasets. A Rapid Plan knowledge-based planning (KB) routine was applied for a prescription of 25\u00a0Gy in 10 fractions using two volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) arcs. The 9 plans used to validate the initial model were added to generate a second version of the RP model (Hippo-MARv2). Automated plans (AP) were compared with manual plans (MP) according to the dose-volume objectives of the PREMER trial. Optimization time and model quality were assessed using 10 patients who were not included in the first 44 datasets.\nA 55% reduction in average optimization time was observed for AP compared to MP. (15 vs 33\u00a0min; p\u2009=\u20090.001).Statistically significant differences in favor of AP were found for D98% (22.6 vs 20.9\u00a0Gy), Homogeneity Index (17.6 vs 23.0) and Hippocampus D mean (11.0 vs 11.7\u00a0Gy). The AP met the proposed objectives without significant deviations, while in the case of the MP, significant deviations from the proposed target values were found in 2 cases.\nThe KB model allows automated planning for HA-PCI. Automation of radiotherapy planning improves efficiency, safety, and quality and could facilitate access to new techniques.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has generated an explosion in the amount of information shared on the internet, including false and misleading information on SARS-CoV-2 and recommended protective behaviors. Prior to the pandemic, web-based misinformation and disinformation were already identified as having an impact on people's decision to refuse or delay recommended vaccination for themselves or their children.\nThe overall aims of our study are to better understand the influence of web-based misinformation and disinformation on COVID-19 vaccine decisions and investigate potential solutions to reduce the impact of web-based misinformation and disinformation about vaccines.\nBased on different research approaches, the study will involve (1) the use of artificial intelligence techniques, (2) a web-based survey, (3) interviews, and (4) a scoping review and an environmental scan of the literature.\nAs of September 1, 2022, data collection has been completed for all objectives. The analysis is being conducted, and results should be disseminated in the upcoming months.\nThe findings from this study will help with understanding the underlying determinants of vaccine hesitancy among Canadian individuals and identifying effective, tailored interventions to improve vaccine acceptance among them.\nDERR1-10.2196/41012.", "Recent advances in optical and robotic technologies have given surgeons high-definition eyes and precision hands that perform beyond human capabilities. This has expanded the scope of minimally invasive surgery and increased opportunities for surgery in high-risk situations; however, absolute surgical safety has not yet been achieved. Deficiencies in human performance are associated with surgical adverse events and advanced surgery places stress on surgeons and affect their concentration, causing not only novice surgeons with limited experience, but even skilled surgeons, to make misrecognition and decision-making errors. Therefore, the issue of \"surgical comfort\" for surgeons cannot be ignored. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI), which is designed to mimic the function of the human brain, has been developed in various fields to assist humans. Computer vision, a visual assistive technology that uses AI, is being applied to surgery and will become available in the near future. AI-controlled robots cannot be expected to replace surgeons, because surgeons operate with higher brain functions that integrate all their abilities, including the senses of humanity, mission, and ethics. However, if there is a way to reduce the mental and physical burden on surgeons by utilizing AI technology, then it should not be ruled out.", "The objective of this study was to evaluate whether child musicians are better at listening to speech in noise (SPIN) than nonmusicians of the same age. In addition, we aimed to explore whether the musician SPIN advantage in children was related to general intelligence (IQ).\nFifty-one children aged 8.2-11.8 years and with different levels of music training participated in the study. A between-group design and correlational analyses were used to determine differences in SPIN skills as they relate to music training. IQ was used as a covariate to explore the relationship between intelligence and SPIN ability.\nMore years of music training were associated with better SPIN skills than fewer years of music training. Furthermore, this difference in SPIN skills remained even when accounting for IQ. These results were found at the group level and also when years of instrument training was treated as a continuous variable (i.e., correlational analyses).\nWe confirmed results from previous studies in which child musicians outperformed nonmusicians in SPIN skills. We also showed that this effect was not related to differences in IQ between the musicians and nonmusicians for this cohort of children. However, confirmation of this finding with a cohort of children from more diverse socioeconomic statuses and cognitive profiles is warranted.", "Conversational agents (CAs), also known as chatbots, are computer programs that simulate human conversations by using predetermined rule-based responses or artificial intelligence algorithms. They are increasingly used in health care, particularly via smartphones. There is, at present, no conceptual framework guiding the development of smartphone-based, rule-based CAs in health care. To fill this gap, we propose structured and tailored guidance for their design, development, evaluation, and implementation.\nThe aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the design, evaluation, and implementation of smartphone-delivered, rule-based, goal-oriented, and text-based CAs for health care.\nWe followed the approach by Jabareen, which was based on the grounded theory method, to develop this conceptual framework. We performed 2 literature reviews focusing on health care CAs and conceptual frameworks for the development of mobile health interventions. We identified, named, categorized, integrated, and synthesized the information retrieved from the literature reviews to develop the conceptual framework. We then applied this framework by developing a CA and testing it in a feasibility study.\nThe Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER) conceptual framework includes 8 iterative steps grouped into 3 stages, as follows: design, comprising defining the goal, creating an identity, assembling the team, and selecting the delivery interface; development, including developing the content and building the conversation flow; and the evaluation and implementation of the CA. They were complemented by 2 cross-cutting considerations-user-centered design and privacy and security-that were relevant at all stages. This conceptual framework was successfully applied in the development of a CA to support lifestyle changes and prevent type 2 diabetes.\nDrawing on published evidence, the DISCOVER conceptual framework provides a step-by-step guide for developing rule-based, smartphone-delivered CAs. Further evaluation of this framework in diverse health care areas and settings and for a variety of users is needed to demonstrate its validity. Future research should aim to explore the use of CAs to deliver health care interventions, including behavior change and potential privacy and safety concerns.", "The rapidly evolving scenario of Artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine comes with new regulatory challenges, including certification, ownership, and control of data sharing, privacy protection, and accountability. The Medical Physicists (MPs) are traditionally responsible for ensuring the safety and quality of technology implementation in diagnostic and therapeutic settings. As such, they are also expected to contribute to the introduction of AI medical devices in routine clinical practice. Specifically, the MPs will play a stakeholder role for AI tools procurement, acceptance testing, commissioning, and quality assurance to confirm the claimed performances in relation to the medical device's intended use. Moreover, MPs who act as co-creators of such AI tools, will play a pivotal role in product requirements definition, data collection and annotation, clinical evaluation, support for regulatory pathways and marketing through scientific congresses and scientific publications. As AI software differs from the traditional (hardware) medical device that the MP is used to introduce in clinical settings, there is a need to acquire new competencies in the field of AI and its regulatory aspects. The purpose of this paper is to provide MPs with practical guidelines on regulatory aspects of AI medical devices, in the European and in the US landscape.", "Cholesteatoma is a progressive middle ear disease that can only be treated surgically but with a high recurrence rate. Depending on the extent of the disease, a surgical approach, such as microsurgery with a retroarticular incision or transcanal endoscopic surgery, is performed. However, the current examination cannot sufficiently predict the progression before surgery, and changes in approach may be made during the surgery. Large amounts of data are typically required to train deep neural network models; however, the prevalence of cholesteatomas is low (1-in-25, 000). Developing analysis methods that improve the accuracy with such a small number of samples is an important issue for medical artificial intelligence (AI) research. This paper presents an AI-based system to automatically detect mastoid extensions using CT. This retrospective study included 164 patients (80 with mastoid extension and 84 without mastoid extension) who underwent surgery. This study adopted a relatively lightweight neural network model called MobileNetV2 to learn and predict the CT images of 164 patients. The training was performed with eight divided groups for cross-validation and was performed 24 times with each of the eight groups to verify accuracy fluctuations caused by randomly augmented learning. An evaluation was performed by each of the 24 single-trained models, and 24 sets of ensemble predictions with 23 models for 100% original size images and 400% zoomed images. Fifteen otolaryngologists diagnosed the images and compared the results. The average accuracy of predicting 400% zoomed images using ensemble prediction model was 81.14% (sensitivity = 84.95%, specificity = 77.33%). The average accuracy of the otolaryngologists was 73.41% (sensitivity, 83.17%; specificity, 64.13%), which was not affected by their clinical experiences. Noteworthily, despite the small number of cases, we were able to create a highly accurate AI. These findings represent an important first step in the automatic diagnosis of the cholesteatoma extension.", "Objective. To assess the impact of variable leadership development program formats on perceived participant growth.Methods. In 2020, the Phi Lambda Sigma national office began offering national Leader Academies to members, while University of South Florida Health Taneja College of Pharmacy simultaneously offered a Leader Academy program to its Phi Lambda Sigma students. Both programs used virtual leadership development tools from GiANT Worldwide, but differed in meeting frequency, content focus, and participant diversity. A 17-question pre- and postsurvey was developed from the Emotional Intelligence Leadership Inventory. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to compare the cohorts.Results. Twenty-two respondents in the national cohort (66.7% response rate) and 15 in the single-institution cohort (100% response rate) were included. There was more diversity in age, ethnicity, and previous education in the national cohort. Significant improvements in perceived growth were noted in almost all areas. The only decrease noted was the national cohort response to \"I strive to improve myself.\" The overall change in mean response values was generally higher for the single-institution cohort. Qualitative data supported these results and showed more notable references to emotional intelligence in the national cohorts (\u223c50%) as compared to the single-institution cohort (<25%).Conclusion. Study results suggest that participation in a longitudinal leadership development program, regardless of cohort format, leads to perceived participant improvement in three categories. However, perceived benefit within each of these categories may vary depending on the cohort. Future studies are needed to further evaluate specific leadership arenas and validate the leadership assessment tool.", "Human cells tightly control their dimensions, but in some cancers, normal cell size control is lost. In this study we measure cell volumes of epithelial cells from human lung adenocarcinoma progression in situ. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), we reconstruct tumor cell shapes in three dimensions (3D) and find airway type 2 cells display up to 10-fold increases in volume. Surprisingly, cell size increase is not caused by altered ploidy, and up to 80% of near-euploid tumor cells show abnormal sizes. Size dysregulation is not explained by cell swelling or senescence because cells maintain cytoplasmic density and proper organelle size scaling, but is correlated with changes in tissue organization and loss of a novel network of processes that appear to connect alveolar type 2 cells. To validate size dysregulation in near-euploid cells, we sorted cells from tumor single-cell suspensions on the basis of size. Our study provides data of unprecedented detail for cell volume dysregulation in a human cancer. Broadly, loss of size control may be a common feature of lung adenocarcinomas in humans and mice that is relevant to disease and identification of these cells provides a useful model for investigating cell size control and consequences of cell size dysregulation.", "The reason why music can affect people's emotional experience is that the stimulation can be transmitted to the brain through hearing, such as the thalamus and lenticular nucleus. Music therapy has a positive auxiliary treatment effect on mental health. Therefore, an evaluation model of the auxiliary effect of music therapy on mental health based on artificial intelligence technology is proposed. We construct the constraint index parameters for the evaluation of music therapy's auxiliary effect on mental health, take parent pressure, self-pressure, teacher pressure, and social pressure as the questionnaire object parameters, take class type as the independent variable, carry out an independent sample t-test, and construct an adaptive information extraction model for the evaluation of music therapy's auxiliary effect on mental health. Paired sample t-test is used to analyze whether there is a difference between the experimental group and the control group on the learning stress scale. According to the analysis of the difference between the experimental group and the control group, combined with the difference test analysis of the data of the stress release of music therapy on mental health, the quantitative evaluation of the auxiliary effect of music therapy on mental health is realized through artificial intelligence optimization control. The experimental results show that the accuracy and reliability of this method to analyze the auxiliary effect of music therapy on mental health are high. There are obvious changes in the data of students' self-pressure, and the difference between the average value and standard deviation of the data before and after the course is obvious. From the perspective of the effectiveness of the course, the students in the class who implement the four relaxation experience courses in the course are under the pressure of parents, self-pressure, teacher pressure, and social pressure. There are obvious changes in the five aspects of learning pressure compared with that before the implementation of the course. After the course experience, the pressure value of most students decreases, and the course intervention effect is obvious.", "Several primary school students in Fujian Province have perceived studying mathematics as challenging. To deal with this issue, computer technology advancements, specifically artificial intelligence (AI), present an opportunity to evaluate individual students' learning challenges and give individualized support to optimize their success in mathematics classes. It is also possible to use virtual reality (VR) to assist learners in acquiring complex mathematical and logical ideas and to lessen learners' mistakes. As a result, researchers, particularly beginners, are missing out on a complete perspective of the study of AI in teaching mathematics. That is why we are exploring the role of AI in math education by developing a \"fuzzy-based tweakable convolution neural network with a long short-term memory (FT-CNN-LSTM-AM)\" method. For this investigation, the students' datasets are taken and educated by mathematical teaching via the application of AI. The proposed method is utilized to predict the students' performance in mathematical education. A grey wolf optimizer is employed to boost the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is analyzed and compared with existing approaches to gain the highest reliability.", "To investigate molecular and clinical characteristics of children with permanent congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in Yunnan, China.\nThe clinical data of 40 children with CH diagnosed and treated in the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province during January 2016 and January 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. All children were followed up to 3\u2005years old, and Gesell intelligent score was evaluated at age of 1, 2 and 3\u2005years, respectively. Developmental status and prognosis were evaluated.

However, the underlying basis on which predictive models make such predictions is often unknown. For genomics researchers, this missing explanatory information would frequently be of greater value than the predictions themselves, as it can enable new insights into genetic processes. We review progress in the emerging area of explainable AI (xAI), a field with the potential to empower life science researchers to gain mechanistic insights into complex deep learning models. We discuss and categorize approaches for model interpretation, including an intuitive understanding of how each approach works and their underlying assumptions and limitations in the context of typical high-throughput biological datasets.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a radically transformative technology (or system of technologies) that created new existential possibilities and new standards of well-being in human societies. In this article, I argue that to properly understand the increasingly important role AI plays in our society, we must consider its impacts on social justice. For this reason, I propose to conceptualize AI's transformative role and its socio-political implications through the lens of the theory of social justice known as the Capability Approach. According to the approach, a just society must put its members in a position to acquire and exercise a series of basic capabilities and provide them with the necessary means for these capabilities to be actively realized. Because AI is re-shaping the very definition of some of these basic capabilities, I conclude that AI itself should be considered among the conditions of possession and realization of the capabilities it transforms. In other words, access to AI-in the many forms this access can take-is necessary for social justice.", "Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have been successfully applied to many domains of interest including medical diagnosis. Due to the availability of a large quantity of data, it is possible to build reliable AI systems that assist humans in making decisions. The recent Covid-19 pandemic quickly spread over the world causing serious health problems and severe economic and social damage. Computer scientists are actively working together with doctors on different ML models to diagnose Covid-19 patients using Computed Tomography (CT) scans and clinical data. In this work, we propose a neural-symbolic system that predicts if a Covid-19 patient arriving at the hospital will end in a critical condition. The proposed system relies on Deep 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNNs) for analyzing lung CT scans of Covid-19 patients, Decision Trees (DTs) for predicting if a Covid-19 patient will eventually pass away by analyzing its clinical data, and a neural system that integrates the previous ones using Hierarchical Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLPs). Predicting if a Covid-19 patient will end in a critical condition is useful for managing the limited number of intensive care at the hospital. Moreover, knowing early that a Covid-19 patient could end in serious conditions allows doctors to gain early knowledge on patients and provide special treatment to those predicted to finish in critical conditions. The proposed system, entitled Neural HPLP, obtains good performance in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic and precision curves with values of about 0.96 for both metrics. Therefore, with Neural HPLP, it is possible not only to efficiently predict if Covid-19 patients will end in severe conditions but also possible to provide an explanation of the prediction. This makes Neural HPLP explainable, interpretable, and reliable. Graphical abstract Representation of Neural HPLP. From top to bottom, the two different types of data collected from the same patient and used in this project are represented. This data feeds the two different machine learning systems and the integration of the two systems using Hierarchical Probabilistic Logic Program.", "Neural networks were trained for segmentation and longitudinal assessment of posttreatment diffuse glioma. A retrospective cohort (from January 2018 to December 2019) of 298 patients with diffuse glioma (mean age, 52 years \u00b1 14 [SD]; 177 men; 152 patients with glioblastoma, 72 patients with astrocytoma, and 74 patients with oligodendroglioma) who underwent two consecutive multimodal MRI examinations were randomly selected into training (n = 198) and testing (n = 100) samples. A posttreatment tumor segmentation three-dimensional nnU-Net convolutional neural network with multichannel inputs (T1, T2, and T1 postcontrast and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR]) was trained to segment three multiclass tissue types (peritumoral edematous, infiltrated, or treatment-changed tissue [ED]; active tumor or enhancing tissue [AT]; and necrotic core). Separate longitudinal change nnU-Nets were trained on registered and subtracted FLAIR and T1 postlongitudinal images to localize and better quantify and classify changes in ED and AT. Segmentation Dice scores, volume similarities, and 95th percentile Hausdorff distances ranged from 0.72 to 0.89, 0.90 to 0.96, and 2.5 to 3.6 mm, respectively. Accuracy rates of the posttreatment tumor segmentation and longitudinal change networks being able to classify longitudinal changes in ED and AT as increased, decreased, or unchanged were 76%-79% and 90%-91%, respectively. The accuracy levels of the longitudinal change networks were not significantly different from those of three neuroradiologists (accuracy, 90%-92%; \u03ba, 0.58-0.63; P > .05). The results of this study support the potential clinical value of artificial intelligence-based automated longitudinal assessment of posttreatment diffuse glioma.

Teachers' pressure and job burnout have become a common and serious problem, which makes teachers' subjective well-being feel a serious impact. The kindergarten environment is challenging and unique. The educational objects faced by kindergarten teachers are usually immature, which brings challenges to the teaching of kindergarten teachers. At the same time, in China, kindergarten teachers also need to undertake daily administrative management and other tasks. Therefore, focusing on the subjective well-being of kindergarten teachers in developing countries during the stage of the COVID-19 pandemic has important implications for promoting teacher well-being globally.\nThe study included 321 kindergarten teachers from 13 kindergartens in Jinan, Shandong Province, China. A cross-sectional study design was used with a cluster random sampling technique. For the present study,\u00a0Five-Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire, Emotional Intelligence Scale, Work-Family Balance Scale and Subjective Well-being Scale were utilized.\nFindings of the study show that trait mindfulness can directly predict subjective well-being. Emotional intelligence played a mediating role in the relationship between trait mindfulness and subjective well-being. Work-family balance played a mediating role between trait mindfulness and subjective well-being. Emotional intelligence and work-family balance play a sequential mediating effect between trait mindfulness and subjective well-being.\nThis study explores the influence mechanism of trait mindfulness on kindergarten teachers' subjective well-being from the perspective of metacognition. An important conclusion of this study is that emotional intelligence and work-family balance play a sequential mediating effect between trait mindfulness and subjective well-being. We believe the findings of this study have important implications for enriching existing theory and educational practice. This finding has important implications for improving the subjective well-being of kindergarten teachers in developing countries, especially in the context of the current severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education systems.", "Beyond transferring genetic information, RNAs are molecules with diverse functions that include catalyzing biochemical reactions and regulating gene expression. Most of these activities depend on RNAs' specific structures. Therefore, accurately determining RNA structure is integral to advancing our understanding of RNA functions. Here, we summarize the state-of-the-art experimental and computational technologies developed to evaluate RNA secondary and tertiary structures. We also highlight how the rapid increase of experimental data facilitates the integrative modeling approaches for better resolving RNA structures. Finally, we provide our thoughts on the latest advances and challenges in RNA structure determination methods, as well as on future directions for both experimental approaches and artificial intelligence-based computational tools to model RNA structure. Ultimately, we hope the technological advances will deepen our understanding of RNA biology and facilitate RNA structure-based biomedical research such as designing specific RNA structures for therapeutics and deploying RNA-targeting small-molecule drugs.", "In this investigation, we explore the literature regarding neuroregeneration from the 1700s to the present. The regeneration of central nervous system neurons or the regeneration of axons from cell bodies and their reconnection with other neurons remains a major hurdle. Injuries relating to war and accidents attracted medical professionals throughout early history to regenerate and reconnect nerves. Early literature till 1990 lacked specific molecular details and is likely provide some clues to conditions that promoted neuron and/or axon regeneration. This is an avenue for the application of natural language processing (NLP) to gain actionable intelligence. Post 1990 period saw an explosion of all molecular details. With the advent of genomic, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other omics-there is an emergence of big data sets and is another rich area for application of NLP. How the neuron and/or axon regeneration related keywords have changed over the years is a first step towards this endeavor.\nSpecifically, this article curates over 600 published works in the field of neuroregeneration. We then apply a dynamic topic modeling algorithm based on the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm to assess how topics cluster based on topics.\nBased on how documents are assigned to topics, we then build a recommendation engine to assist researchers to access domain-specific literature based on how their search text matches to recommended document topics. The interface further includes interactive topic visualizations for researchers to understand how topics grow closer and further apart, and how intra-topic composition changes over time.\nWe present a recommendation engine and interactive interface that enables dynamic topic modeling for neuronal regeneration.", "Little is known about the associations between mild intellectual disability (MID), borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) and aggressive behaviour in general mental health care. The study aims to establish the association between aggressive behaviour and MID/BIF, analysing patient characteristics and diagnoses.\n1174 out of 1565 consecutive in-and outpatients were screened for MID/BIF with the Screener for Intelligence and Learning Disabilities (SCIL) in general mental health care in The Netherlands. During treatment, aggressive behaviour was assessed with the Staff Observation Aggression Scale-Revised (SOAS-R). We calculated odds ratios and performed a logistic and poisson regression to calculate the associations of MID/ BIF, patient characteristics and diagnoses with the probability of aggression.\nForty-one percent of participating patients were screened positive for MID/BIF. Patients with assumed MID/BIF showed significantly more aggression at the patient and sample level (odds ratio (OR) of 2.50 for aggression and 2.52 for engaging in outwardly directed physical aggression). The proportion of patients engaging in 2-5 repeated aggression incidents was higher in assumed MID (OR = 3.01, 95% CI 1.82-4.95) and MID/BIF (OR = 4.20, 95% CI 2.45-7.22). Logistic regression showed that patients who screened positive for BIF (OR 2,0 95% CL 1.26-3.17), MID (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.87-4.46), had a bipolar disorder (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.79-5.28), schizophrenia (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.80-4.19), and younger age (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.15-2.50), were more likely to have engaged in any aggression. Poisson regression underlined these findings, showing a SCIL of 15 and below (\u03b2 = 0.61, p<0.001) was related to more incidents.\nWe found an increased risk for aggression and physical aggression in patients with assumed MID/BIF. We recommend screening for intellectual functioning at the start of treatment and using measures to prevent and manage aggressive behaviour that fits patients with MID/BIF.", "Objective. Cephalometric analysis has been significantly facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years. For digital cephalograms, linear measurements are conducted based on the length calibration process, which has not been automatized in current AI-based systems. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an automated calibration system for lateral cephalometry to conduct linear measurements more efficiently.Approach. This system was based on deep learning algorithms and medical priors of a stable structure, the anterior cranial base (Sella-Nasion). First, a two-stage cascade convolutional neural network was constructed based on 2860 cephalograms to locate sella, nasion, and 2 ruler points in regions of interest. Further, Sella-Nasion distance was applied to estimate the distance between ruler points, and then pixels size of cephalograms was attained for linear measurements. The accuracy of automated landmark localization, ruler length prediction, and linear measurement based on automated calibration was evaluated with statistical analysis.Main results. First, for AI-located points, 99.6% ofSand 86% ofNpoints deviated less than 2 mm from the ground truth, and 99% of ruler points deviated less than 0.3 mm from the ground truth. Also, this system correctly predicted the ruler length of 98.95% of samples. Based on automated calibration, 11 linear cephalometric measurements of the test set showed no difference from manual calibration (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).Significance. This system was the first reported in the literature to conduct automated calibration with high accuracy and showed high potential for clinical application in cephalometric analysis.", "Microrobots have attracted the attention of scientists owing to their unique features to accomplish tasks in hard-to-reach sites in the human body. Microrobots can be precisely actuated and maneuvered individually or in a swarm for cargo delivery, sampling, surgery, and imaging applications. In addition, microrobots have found applications in the environmental sector (e.g., water treatment). Besides, recent advancements of three-dimensional (3D) printers have enabled the high-resolution fabrication of microrobots with a faster design-production turnaround time for users with limited micromanufacturing skills. Here, the latest end applications of 3D printed microrobots are reviewed (ranging from environmental to biomedical applications) along with a brief discussion over the feasible actuation methods (e.g., on- and off-board), and practical 3D printing technologies for microrobot fabrication. In addition, as a future perspective, we discussed the potential advantages of integration of microrobots with smart materials, and conceivable benefits of implementation of artificial intelligence (AI), as well as physical intelligence (PI). Moreover, in order to facilitate bench-to-bedside translation of microrobots, current challenges impeding clinical translation of microrobots are elaborated, including entry obstacles (e.g., immune system attacks) and cumbersome standard test procedures to ensure biocompatibility.", "We perform a data-driven dimensionality reduction of the scale-dependent four-point vertex function characterizing the functional renormalization group (FRG) flow for the widely studied two-dimensional t-t^{'} Hubbard model on the square lattice. We demonstrate that a deep learning architecture based on a neural ordinary differential equation solver in a low-dimensional latent space efficiently learns the FRG dynamics that delineates the various magnetic and d-wave superconducting regimes of the Hubbard model. We further present a dynamic mode decomposition analysis that confirms that a small number of modes are indeed sufficient to capture the FRG dynamics.

In the effort to improve the monitoring of cases admitted to emergency departments, it has become increasingly necessary to adopt new innovative technological solutions in clinical practice. Currently, the continuous monitoring of vital signs is only performed in patients admitted to the intensive care unit.\nThe study aimed to develop a smart system that will dynamically prioritize patients through the continuous monitoring of vital signs using a wearable biosensor device and recording of meaningful clinical records and estimate the likelihood of deterioration of each case using artificial intelligence models.\nThe data for the study were collected from the emergency department and COVID-19 inpatient unit of the Hippokration General Hospital of Thessaloniki. The study was carried out in the framework of the COVID-X H2020 project, which was funded by the European Union. For the training of the neural network, data collection was performed from COVID-19 cases hospitalized in the respective unit. A wearable biosensor device was placed on the wrist of each patient, which recorded the primary characteristics of the visual signal related to breathing assessment.\nA total of 157 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were recruited. Lasso penalty function was used for selecting 18 out of 48 predictors and 2 random forest-based models were implemented for comparison. The high overall performance was maintained, if not improved, by feature selection, with random forest achieving accuracies of 80.9% and 82.1% when trained using all predictors and a subset of them, respectively. Preliminary results, although affected by pandemic limitations and restrictions, were promising regarding breathing pattern recognition.\nThis study represents a novel approach that involves the use of machine learning methods and Edge artificial intelligence to assist the prioritization and continuous monitoring procedures of patients with COVID-19 in health departments. Although initial results appear to be promising, further studies are required to examine its actual effectiveness.", "To present a concept called artificial intelligence-assisted contour editing (AIACE) and demonstrate its feasibility.\nThe conceptual workflow of AIACE is as follows: Given an initial contour that requires clinician editing, the clinician indicates where large editing is needed, and a trained deep learning model uses this input to update the contour. This process repeats until a clinically acceptable contour is achieved. In this retrospective, proof-of-concept study, the authors demonstrated the concept on two-dimensional (2D) axial CT images from three head-and-neck cancer datasets by simulating the interaction with the AIACE model to mimic the clinical environment. The input at each iteration was one mouse click on the desired location of the contour segment. Model performance is quantified with the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance (HD95) based on three datasets with sample sizes of 10, 28, and 20 patients.\nThe average DSCs and HD95 values of the automatically generated initial contours were 0.82 and 4.3 mm, 0.73 and 5.6 mm, and 0.67 and 11.4 mm for the three datasets, which were improved to 0.91 and 2.1 mm, 0.86 and 2.5 mm, and 0.86 and 3.3 mm, respectively, with three mouse clicks. Each deep learning-based contour update required about 20 msec.\nThe authors proposed the newly developed AIACE concept, which uses deep learning models to assist clinicians in editing contours efficiently and effectively, and demonstrated its feasibility by using 2D axial CT images from three head-and-neck cancer datasets.Keywords: Segmentation, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), CT, Deep Learning Algorithms Supplemental material is available for this article. \u00a9 RSNA, 2022.", "Conservation of biodiversity is critical for the coexistence of humans and the sustenance of other living organisms within the ecosystem. Identification and prioritization of specific regions to be conserved are impossible without proper information about the sites. Advanced monitoring agencies like the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) had accredited that the sum total of species that are now threatened with extinction is higher than ever before in the past and are progressing toward extinct at an alarming rate. Besides this, the conceptualized global responses to these crises are still inadequate and entail drastic changes. Therefore, more sophisticated monitoring and conservation techniques are required which can simultaneously cover a larger surface area within a stipulated time frame and gather a large pool of data. Hence, this study is an overview of remote monitoring methods in biodiversity conservation via a survey of evidence-based reviews and related studies, wherein the description of the application of some technology for biodiversity conservation and monitoring is highlighted. Finally, the paper also describes various transformative smart technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and/or machine learning algorithms for enhanced working efficiency of currently available techniques that will aid remote monitoring methods in biodiversity conservation.", "To investigate the prevalence and associated factors of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and advanced DR in Chinese adults with diabetes mellitus (DM).\nA cross-sectional study was performed on 4831 diabetic patients from 24 hospitals from April 2018 to July 2020. Non-mydriatic fundus of patients were interpreted by an artificial intelligence (AI) system. Fundus photos that were unsuitable for AI interpretation were interpreted by two ophthalmologists trained by one expert ophthalmologist at Beijing Tongren Hospital. Medical history, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, and laboratory examinations were recorded.\nA total of 4831 DM patients were included in this study. The prevalence of DR and advanced DR in the diabetic population was 31.8% and 6.6%, respectively. In multiple logistic regression analysis, male (odds ratio [OR], 1.39), duration of diabetes (OR, 1.05), HbA1c (OR, 1.11), farmer (OR, 1.39), insulin treatment (OR, 1.61), region (northern, OR, 1.78; rural, OR, 6.96), and presence of other diabetic complications (OR: 2.03) were associated with increased odds of DR. The factors associated with increased odds of advanced DR included poor glycemic control (HbA1c >7.0%) (OR, 2.58), insulin treatment (OR, 1.73), longer duration of diabetes (OR, 3.66), rural region (OR, 4.84), and presence of other diabetic complications (OR, 2.36), but overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2) (OR, 0.61) was associated with reduced odds of advanced DR.\nThis study shows that the prevalence of DR is very high in Chinese adults with DM, highlighting the necessity of early diabetic retinal screening.", "This paper presents an improved Discrete Salp Swarm Algorithm based on the Ant Colony System (DSSACS). Firstly, we use the Ant Colony System (ACS) to optimize the initialization of the salp colony and discretize the algorithm, then use the crossover operator and mutation operator to simulate the foraging behavior of the followers in the salp colony. We tested DSSACS with several algorithms on the TSP dataset. For TSP files of different sizes, the error of DSSACS is generally between 0.78% and 2.95%, while other algorithms are generally higher than 2.03%, or even 6.43%. The experiments show that our algorithm has a faster convergence speed, better positive feedback mechanism, and higher accuracy. We also apply the new algorithm for the Wireless rechargeable sensor network (WRSN) problem. For the selection of the optimal path, the path selected by DSSACS is always about 20% shorter than the path selected by ACS. Results show that DSSACS has obvious advantages over other algorithms in MCV's multi-path planning and saves more time and economic cost than other swarm intelligence algorithms in the wireless rechargeable sensor network.", "We proposed an artificial intelligence-based immune index, Deep-immune score, quantifying the infiltration of immune cells interacting with the tumor stroma in hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images of colorectal cancer.\nA total of 1010 colorectal cancer patients from three centers were enrolled in this retrospective study, divided into a primary (N\u2009=\u2009544) and a validation cohort (N\u2009=\u2009466). We proposed the Deep-immune score, which reflected both tumor stroma proportion and the infiltration of immune cells in the stroma region. We further analyzed the correlation between the score and CD3+\u2009T\u00a0cells density in the stroma region using immunohistochemistry-stained whole-slide images. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazard model, and the endpoint of the event was the overall survival.\nPatients were classified into 4-level score groups (score 1-4). A high Deep-immune score was associated with a high level of CD3+\u2009T\u00a0cells infiltration in the stroma region. In the primary cohort, survival analysis showed a significant difference in 5-year survival rates between score 4 and score 1 groups: 87.4% vs. 58.2% (Hazard ratio for score 4 vs. score 1 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.48, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Similar trends were observed in the validation cohort (89.8% vs. 67.0%; 0.31, 0.15-0.62,\u2009<\u20090.001). Stratified analysis showed that the Deep-immune score could distinguish high-risk and low-risk patients in stage II colorectal cancer (P\u2009=\u20090.018).\nThe proposed Deep-immune score quantified by artificial intelligence can reflect the immune status of patients with colorectal cancer and is\u00a0associate with favorable survival.

Organ segmentation is required for quantification of specific uptake in organs of interest and whole-body dosimetry but is a time-consuming task which induces high interobserver variability. Therefore, we explored using manual segmentations versus an artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated segmentation tool as a pre-processing step for calculating whole-body effective doses to determine the influence of variability in volumetric whole-organ segmentations on dosimetry.\nPET/CT data of six patients undergoing imaging with 89Zr-labelled pembrolizumab were included. Manual organ segmentations were performed, using in-house developed software, and biodistribution information was obtained. Based on the activity biodistribution information, residence times were calculated. The residence times served as input for OLINDA/EXM version 1.0 (Vanderbilt University, 2003) to calculate the whole-body effective dose (mSv/MBq). Subsequently, organ segmentations were performed using RECOMIA, a cloud-based AI platform for nuclear medicine and radiology research. The workflow for calculating residence times and whole-body effective doses, as described above, was repeated.\nData were acquired on days 2, 4, and 7 post-injection, resulting in 18 scans. Overall analysis time per scan was approximately 4\u00a0h for manual segmentations compared to\u2009\u2264\u200930\u00a0min using AI-based segmentations. Median Jaccard similarity coefficients between manual and AI-based segmentations varied from 0.05 (range 0.00-0.14) for the pancreas to 0.78 (range 0.74-0.82) for the lungs. Whole-body effective doses differed minimally for the six patients with a median difference in received mSv/MBq of 0.52% (range 0.15-1.95%).\nThis pilot study suggests that whole-body dosimetry calculations can benefit from fast, automated AI-based whole organ segmentations.", "We suggest an augmentation of the excellent comprehensive review article titled \"Comprehensive literature review on the radiographic findings, imaging modalities, and the role of radiology in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic\" under the following categories: (1) \"Inclusion of additional radiological features, related to pulmonary infarcts and to COVID-19 pneumonia\"; (2) \"Amplified discussion of cardiovascular COVID-19 manifestations and the role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring and prognosis\"; (3) \"Imaging findings related to fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, optical, thermal and other imaging modalities/devices, including 'intelligent edge' and other remote monitoring devices\"; (4) \"Artificial intelligence in COVID-19 imaging\"; (5) \"Additional annotations to the radiological images in the manuscript to illustrate the additional signs discussed\"; and (6) \"A minor correction to a passage on pulmonary destruction\".", "The use of technology in the healthcare sector and its medical practices, from patient record maintenance to diagnostics, has significantly improved the health care emergency management system. At that backdrop, it is crucial to explore the role and challenges of these technologies in the healthcare sector. Therefore, this study provides a systematic review of the literature on technological developments in the healthcare sector and deduces its pros and cons. We curate the published studies from the Web of Science and Scopus databases by using PRISMA 2015 guidelines. After mining the data, we selected only 55 studies for the systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis. The study explores four significant classifications of technological development in healthcare: (a) digital technologies, (b) artificial intelligence, (c) blockchain, and (d) the Internet of Things. The novel contribution of current study indicate that digital technologies have significantly influenced the healthcare services such as the beginning of electronic health record, a new era of digital healthcare, while robotic surgeries and machine learning algorithms may replace practitioners as future technologies. However, a considerable number of studies have criticized these technologies in the health sector based on trust, security, privacy, and accuracy. The study suggests that future studies, on technological development in healthcare services, may take into account these issues for sustainable development of the healthcare sector.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has high diagnostic accuracy for coronary artery disease (CAD) from myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). However, when trained using high-risk populations (such as patients with correlating invasive testing), the disease probability can be overestimated due to selection bias. We evaluated different strategies for training AI models to improve the calibration (accurate estimate of disease probability), using external testing.\nDeep learning was trained using 828 patients from 3 sites, with MPI and invasive angiography within 6\u00a0months. Perfusion was assessed using upright (U-TPD) and supine total perfusion deficit (S-TPD). AI training without data augmentation (model 1) was compared to training with augmentation (increased sampling) of patients without obstructive CAD (model 2), and patients without CAD and TPD\u2009<\u20092% (model 3). All models were tested in an external population of patients with invasive angiography within 6\u00a0months (n\u2009=\u2009332) or low likelihood of CAD (n\u2009=\u2009179).\nModel 3 achieved the best calibration (Brier score 0.104 vs 0.121, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Improvement in calibration was particularly evident in women (Brier score 0.084 vs 0.124, p\u2009<\u20090.01). In external testing (n\u2009=\u2009511), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was higher for model 3 (0.930), compared to U-TPD (AUC 0.897) and S-TPD (AUC 0.900, p\u2009<\u20090.01 for both).\nTraining AI models with augmentation of low-risk patients can improve calibration of AI models developed to identify patients with CAD, allowing more accurate assignment of disease probability. This is particularly important in lower-risk populations and in women, where overestimation of disease probability could significantly influence down-stream patient management.", "Public health and public safety collaborations can strengthen and improve efforts to address the worsening drug overdose crisis.\nThe Overdose Response Strategy is addressing this need through a national public health and public safety program designed to foster the cross-sector sharing of timely data, pertinent intelligence, and evidence-based and innovative strategies to prevent and respond to drug overdose.\nSince 2015, the Overdose Response Strategy has been implemented by state-based public health and public safety teams who work together to prevent and respond to drug overdoses within and across sectors, states, and territories. The public health and public safety teams share data systems to inform rapid and effective community overdose prevention efforts; support immediate, evidence-based response efforts that can directly reduce overdose deaths; design and use promising strategies at the intersection of public health and public safety; and use effective and efficient primary prevention strategies that can reduce substance use and overdose long term. Implementation of the Overdose Response Strategy aligns with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Strategic Partnering Framework.\nThe evaluation of the Overdose Response Strategy, which is currently underway, is based on 2 evaluation approaches: Collective Impact and Organizational Network Analysis. These approaches provide a way to look at the strength of the relationship between public health and public safety and the way the relationship is leveraged to advance program goals and objectives.\nThe Overdose Response Strategy serves as a strategic partnership model that can potentially be applied to other issues, such as gun violence, that may benefit from public health and public safety collaboration.", "Radiology is integral to cancer care. Compared to molecular assays, imaging has its advantages. Imaging as a noninvasive tool can assess the entirety of tumor unbiased by sampling error and is routinely acquired at multiple time points in oncological practice. Imaging data can be digitally post-processed for quantitative assessment. The ever-increasing application of Artificial intelligence (AI) to clinical imaging is challenging radiology to become a discipline with competence in data science, which plays an important role in modern oncology. Beyond streamlining certain clinical tasks, the power of AI lies in its ability to reveal previously undetected or even imperceptible radiographic patterns that may be difficult to ascertain by the human sensory system. Here, we provide a narrative review of the emerging AI applications relevant to the oncological imaging spectrum and elaborate on emerging paradigms and opportunities. We envision that these technical advances will change radiology in the coming years, leading to the optimization of imaging acquisition and discovery of clinically relevant biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring. Together, they pave the road for future clinical translation in precision oncology.", "In this paper, in-depth research analysis of anti-hepatocellular carcinoma molecular targets for hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis was conducted using artificial intelligence. Because BRD4 plays an important role in gene transcription for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, tumor-targeted therapy by inhibiting the expression or function of BRD4 has received increasing attention in the field of antitumor research. Study subjects in small samples were used as the validation set for validating each diagnostic model constructed based on the training set. The diagnostic effect of each model in the validation set is evaluated by calculating the sensitivity, specificity, and compliance rate, and the model with the best and most stable diagnostic value is selected by combining the results of model construction, validation, and evaluation. The total sample was divided into a training set and test set by using a stratified sampling method in the ratio of 7\u2004:\u20043. Logistic regression, weighted k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and BP artificial neural network were used in the training set to construct diagnostic models for early-stage liver cancer, respectively, and the optimal parameters of the corresponding models were obtained, and then, the constructed models were validated in the test set. To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy, stability, and generalization ability of the four classification methods more robustly, a 10-fold crossover test was performed for each classification method. BRD4 is an epigenetic regulator that is associated with the upregulation of expression of various oncogenic drivers in tumors. Targeting BRD4 with pharmacological inhibitors has emerged as a novel approach for tumor treatment. However, before we implemented this topic, there were no detailed studies on whether BRD4 could be used for the treatment of HCC, the role of BRD4 in HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis, and the ability of small molecule BRD4 inhibitors to induce apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.", "The rapid and accurate in silico prediction of protein-ligand binding free energies or binding affinities has the potential to transform drug discovery. In recent years, there has been a rapid growth of interest in deep learning methods for the prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities based on the structural information of protein-ligand complexes. These structure-based scoring functions often obtain better results than classical scoring functions when applied within their applicability domain. Here we review structure-based scoring functions for binding affinity prediction based on deep learning, focussing on different types of architectures, featurization strategies, data sets, methods for training and evaluation, and the role of explainable artificial intelligence in building useful models for real drug-discovery applications.", "The recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies coupled with medical imaging data has gained considerable attention, and offers a non-invasive approach for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In this context, improved breast cancer (BC) molecular characteristics assessment models are foreseen to enable personalized strategies with better clinical outcomes compared to existing screening strategies. And it is a promising approach to developing models for hormone receptors (HR) and subtypes of BC patients from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data.\nIn this institutional review board-approved study, 174 BC patients with both DCE-MRI and RNA-seq data in the local database were analyzed. Slice images from tumor lesions and multi-scale peri-tumor regions were used as model inputs, and five representative pre-trained transfer learning (TF) networks, such as Inception-v3 and Xception, were employed to establish prediction models. A comprehensive analysis was performed using five-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting, and accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to evaluate model performance.\nXception achieved the superior results when using solely tumor regions, with highest AUROCs of 0.844 (95% CI: [0.841, 0.847]) and 0.784 (95% CI: [0.781, 0.788]) for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), respectively, and best ACC of 0.467 (95% CI: [0.462, 0.470]) for PAM50 subtypes. A significant improvement in the model performance was observed when images of the peri-tumor region were included, with optimal results achieved using images of the tumor and the 10\u00a0mm peri-tumor regions. Xception-based TF models performed most effectively in predicting ER and PR statuses, with the AUROCs were 0.942 (95% CI: [0.940, 0.944]) and 0.920 (95% CI: [0.917, 0.922]), respectively, whereas for PAM50 subtypes, the Inception-v3-based network yielded the highest ACC as 0.742 (95% CI: [0.738, 0.746]).\nTransfer learning analysis based on DCE-MRI data of tumor and peri-tumor regions was helpful to the non-invasive assessment of molecular characteristics of BC.", "Accurate identification of the ankle joint centre is critical for estimating tibial coronal alignment in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The purpose of the current study was to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to determine the accuracy and effect of using different radiological anatomical landmarks to quantify mechanical alignment in relation to a traditionally defined radiological ankle centre.\nPatients with full-limb radiographs from the Osteoarthritis Initiative were included. A sub-cohort of 250 radiographs were annotated for landmarks relevant to knee alignment and used to train a deep learning (U-Net) workflow for angle calculation on the entire database. The radiological ankle centre was defined as the midpoint of the superior talus edge/tibial plafond. Knee alignment (hip-knee-ankle angle) was compared against 1) midpoint of the most prominent malleoli points, 2) midpoint of the soft-tissue overlying malleoli, and 3) midpoint of the soft-tissue sulcus above the malleoli.\nA total of 932 bilateral full-limb radiographs (1,864 knees) were measured at a rate of 20.63 seconds/image. The knee alignment using the radiological ankle centre was accurate against ground truth radiologist measurements (inter-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.99 (0.98 to 0.99)). Compared to the radiological ankle centre, the mean midpoint of the malleoli was 2.3 mm (SD 1.3) lateral and 5.2 mm (SD 2.4) distal, shifting alignment by 0.34o (SD 2.4o) valgus, whereas the midpoint of the soft-tissue sulcus was 4.69 mm (SD 3.55) lateral and 32.4 mm (SD 12.4) proximal, shifting alignment by 0.65o (SD 0.55o) valgus. On the intermalleolar line, measuring a point at 46% (SD 2%) of the intermalleolar width from the medial malleoli (2.38 mm medial adjustment from midpoint) resulted in knee alignment identical to using the radiological ankle centre.\nThe current study leveraged AI to create a consistent and objective model that can estimate patient-specific adjustments necessary for optimal landmark usage in extramedullary and computer-guided navigation for tibial coronal alignment to match radiological planning.Cite this article: Bone Jt Open\u00a02022;3(10):767-776.", "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning has emerged as a plausible alternative to systems biology for the elucidation of biological phenomena and in attaining specified design objective in synthetic biology. Although considered highly disruptive with numerous notable successes so far, we seek to bring attention to both the fundamental and practical pitfalls of their usage, especially in illuminating emergent behaviors from chaotic or stochastic systems in biology. Without deliberating on their suitability and the required data qualities and pre-processing approaches beforehand, the research and development community could experience similar 'AI winters' that had plagued other fields. Instead, we anticipate the integration or combination of the two approaches, where appropriate, moving forward.", "The illustrations in picture books are lovely and emotional; pictures and text work together to express a theme and weave into one another to create a seamless and comprehensive visual image in picture books. Reading helps children improve for life and is an unending source of wealth in one's life. Picture book reading has a positive effect on children's psychological well-being since it allows them to develop different intelligences and their spiritual worlds in addition to reading stories and learning facts. This thesis investigates, against the backdrop of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning, the impact of reading activities on children's psychological health. Deep learning and AI are the tools used where students can engage in a more in-depth conversation with the article and comprehend the author's mindset and background after completing the basic reading. This can help students' analytical, thinking, writing, and other application skills, as well as give them the opportunity to learn from and build upon their first reading accumulation. Research has shown that this method produces impressive results, and it is suited for widespread use because its reasonable strength has improved by 17.24% when compared to the conventional method.", "Immunotherapy deals with therapeutic interventions to arrest the progression of tumours using the immune system. These include checkpoint inhibitors, T-cell manipulation, cytokines, oncolytic viruses and tumour vaccines. In this paper, we present a survey of the latest developments on immunotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in this context. Among these, microsatellite instability (MSI) is perhaps the most popular IO biomarker globally. We first discuss the MSI status of tumours, its implications for patient management, and its relationship to immune response. In recent years, several aspiring studies have used AI to predict the MSI status of patients from digital whole-slide images (WSIs) of routine diagnostic slides. We present a survey of AI literature on the prediction of MSI and tumour mutation burden from digitised WSIs of haematoxylin and eosin-stained diagnostic slides. We discuss AI approaches in detail and elaborate their contributions, limitations and key takeaways to drive future research. We further expand this survey to other IO-related biomarkers like immune cell infiltrates and alternate data modalities like immunohistochemistry and gene expression. Finally, we underline possible future directions in immunotherapy for CRC and promise of AI to accelerate this exploration for patient benefits.", "Automated sleep disorder detection is challenging because physiological symptoms can vary widely. These variations make it difficult to create effective sleep disorder detection models which support hu-man experts during diagnosis and treatment monitoring. From 2010 to 2021, authors of 95 scientific papers have taken up the challenge of automating sleep disorder detection. This paper provides an expert review of this work. We investigated whether digital technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can provide automated diagnosis support for sleep disorders. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines during the content discovery phase. We compared the performance of proposed sleep disorder detection methods, involving differ-ent datasets or signals. During the review, we found eight sleep disorders, of which sleep apnea and insomnia were the most studied. These disorders can be diagnosed using several kinds of biomedical signals, such as Electrocardiogram (ECG), Polysomnography (PSG), Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electromyogram (EMG), and snore sound. Subsequently, we established areas of commonality and distinctiveness. Common to all reviewed papers was that AI models were trained and tested with labelled physiological signals. Looking deeper, we discovered that 24 distinct algorithms were used for the detection task. The nature of these algorithms evolved, before 2017 only traditional Machine Learning (ML) was used. From 2018 onward, both ML and Deep Learning (DL) methods were used for sleep disorder detection. The strong emergence of DL algorithms has considerable implications for future detection systems because these algorithms demand significantly more data for training and testing when compared with ML. Based on our review results, we suggest that both type and amount of labelled data is crucial for the design of future sleep disorder detection systems because this will steer the choice of AI algorithm which establishes the desired decision support. As a guiding principle, more labelled data will help to represent the variations in symptoms. DL algorithms can extract information from these larger data quantities more effectively, therefore; we predict that the role of these algorithms will continue to expand.", "Cancer is a major global health issue. Despite technological advancements in oncology, challenges remain in many aspects related to cancer management. This study constitutes one part of the user requirement definition of INCISIVE EU H2020 project, which has been designed to explore the full potential of artificial intelligence (AI) based technologies in cancer imaging. The study aimed to explore cancer survivors' experiences of cancer care in five European countries.\nA qualitative study employing semi-structured interviews was conducted. A purposive sampling strategy was used to recruit participants across the five validation countries of INCISIVE project: Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Italy, and Serbia. Forty cancer survivors were interviewed between November 2020 and March 2021. Data was analysed thematically using the framework approach and coded using NVivo12 software.\nThe analysis yielded several gaps within the cancer care pathway which reflected on the participants experiences. Five key themes were revealed; (1) perceived challenges during the cancer journey, (2) the importance of accurate and prompt diagnosis, (3) perceived need for improving cancer diagnosis, (4) absence of well-established/designated support services within the pathway and (5) suggestions to improve cancer care pathway.\nCancer survivors experienced significant burdens pertaining to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Our findings underscored some main gaps within the cancer care pathway which contributed to the challenges articulated by the participants including lack of resources and delays in diagnostic and treatment intervals. Additionally, several suggestions were provided by the cancer survivors which could be considered towards the improvement of the current state of care, some of which can be optimised using new technologies involving AI such as the one proposed by INCISIVE.", "In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has risen steadily, including a wide range of applications in the field of pharmacology. AI is now used throughout the entire continuum of pharmacology research and clinical practice and from early drug discovery to real-world datamining. The types of AI models used range from unsupervised clustering of drugs or patients aimed at identifying potential drug compounds or suitable patient populations, to supervised machine learning approaches to improve therapeutic drug monitoring. Additionally, natural language processing is increasingly used to mine electronic health records to obtain real-world data. In this mini-review, we discuss the basics of AI followed by an outline of its application in pharmacology research and clinical practice.", "Lesion/tissue segmentation on digital medical images enables biomarker extraction, image-guided therapy delivery, treatment response measurement, and training/validation for developing artificial intelligence algorithms and workflows. To ensure data reproducibility, criteria for standardised segmentation are critical but currently unavailable.\nA modified Delphi process initiated by the European Imaging Biomarker Alliance (EIBALL) of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Imaging Group was undertaken. Three multidisciplinary task forces addressed modality and image acquisition, segmentation methodology itself, and standards and logistics. Devised survey questions were fed via a facilitator to expert participants. The 58 respondents to Round 1 were invited to participate in Rounds 2-4. Subsequent rounds were informed by responses of previous rounds.\nItems with\u2009\u2265\u200975% consensus are considered a recommendation. These include system performance certification, thresholds for image signal-to-noise, contrast-to-noise and tumour-to-background ratios, spatial resolution, and artefact levels. Direct, iterative, and machine or deep learning reconstruction methods, use of a mixture of CE marked and verified research tools were agreed and use of specified reference standards and validation processes considered essential. Operator training and refreshment were considered mandatory for clinical trials and clinical research. Items with a 60-74% agreement require reporting (site-specific accreditation for clinical research, minimal pixel number within lesion segmented, use of post-reconstruction algorithms, operator training refreshment for clinical practice). Items with\u2009\u2264\u200960% agreement are outside current recommendations for segmentation (frequency of system performance tests, use of only CE-marked tools, board certification of operators, frequency of operator refresher training). Recommendations by anatomical area are also specified.", "Cognitive aging is associated with widespread neural reorganization processes in the human brain. However, the behavioral impact of such reorganization is not well understood. The current neuroimaging study investigated age differences in the functional network architecture during semantic word retrieval in young and older adults. Combining task-based functional connectivity, graph theory and cognitive measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence, our findings show age-accompanied large-scale network reorganization even when older adults have intact word retrieval abilities. In particular, functional networks of older adults were characterized by reduced decoupling between systems, reduced segregation and efficiency, and a larger number of hub regions relative to young adults. Exploring the predictive utility of these age-related changes in network topology revealed high, albeit less efficient, performance for older adults whose brain graphs showed stronger dedifferentiation and reduced distinctiveness. Our results extend theoretical accounts on neurocognitive aging by revealing the compensational potential of the commonly reported pattern of network dedifferentiation when older adults can rely on their prior knowledge for successful task processing. However, we also demonstrate the limitations of such compensatory reorganization and show that a youth-like network architecture in terms of balanced integration and segregation is associated with more economical processing.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have resulted in significant enthusiasm for their promise in healthcare. Despite this, prospective randomized controlled trials and successful clinical implementation remain limited. One clinical application of ML is mitigation of the increased risk for acute care during outpatient cancer therapy. We previously reported the results of the System for High Intensity EvaLuation During Radiation Therapy (SHIELD-RT) study (NCT04277650), which was a prospective, randomized quality improvement study demonstrating that ML based on electronic health record (EHR) data can direct supplemental clinical evaluations and reduce the rate of acute care during cancer radiotherapy\u00a0with and without chemotherapy. The objective of this study is to report the workflow and operational challenges encountered during ML implementation on the SHIELD-RT study.\nData extraction and manual review steps in the workflow represented significant time commitments for implementation of clinical ML on a prospective, randomized study. Barriers include limited data availability through the standard clinical workflow and commercial products, the need to aggregate data from multiple sources, and logistical challenges from altering the standard clinical workflow to deliver adaptive care.\nThe SHIELD-RT study was an early randomized controlled study which enabled assessment of barriers to clinical ML implementation, specifically those which leverage the EHR. These challenges build on a growing body of literature and may provide lessons for future healthcare ML adoption.\nNCT04277650. Registered 20 February 2020. Retrospectively registered quality improvement study.", "Digital therapeutics (DTx) are a subset of digital health which are often coupled with artificial intelligence (A.I.) techniques and machine learning systems. DTx differ from common wellness apps or medication reminder tools in that they require \"rigorous\" clinical evidence. They are emerging as a new treatment option and are being applied in a variety of areas, including type II diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory problems, obesity, insomnia, Alzheimer's disease, various types of dementia or addiction (smoking, alcohol, drugs), anxiety, depression, autism, learning disabilities, and attention deficits. Today, there are roughly 35 to 40 products on the market, 8 of which approved by regulatory agencies. The value of the global DTx market was estimated at USD 1.8 billion in 2018, and it is expected to reach USD 8.9 billion by 2027. Implementing DTx across healthcare systems raises a number of ethical concerns. The present article aims to provide an overview of the main ethical issues pertaining the assessment, implementation, and use of this emerging technology. The final purpose is to support and facilitate an open and transparent deliberation with regard to DTx.", "DNA origami has created complex structures of various spatial dimensions. However, their versatility in terms of function is limited due to the lower number of the intrinsic building blocks, i.e. nucleotides, compared with the number of amino acids. Therefore, protein origami has been proposed and demonstrated to precisely fabricate artificial functional nanostructures. Despite their hierarchical folded structures, chain-like peptides and DNA share obvious similarities in both structures and properties, especially in terms of chain hybridization; therefore, replacing DNA with peptides to create bioactivities not only has high theoretical feasibility but also provides a new bottom-up synthetic strategy. However, designing functionalities with tens to hundreds of peptide chains using the similar principle of DNA origami has not been reported, although the origami strategy holds great potential to generate more complex bioactivities. In this perspective review, we have reviewed the recent progress in and highlighted the advantages of peptide assembly and origami on the orientation of artificially created bioactivities. With the great potential of peptide origami, we appeal to develop user-friendly softwares in combination with artificial intelligence.", "Ubiquitous technology, big data, more efficient electronic health records, and predictive analytics are now at the core of smart healthcare systems supported by artificial intelligence. In the present narrative review, we focus on sensing technologies for the healthcare of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). We employed a framework inspired by the Interpersonal Neurobiology Theory (IPNB), which posits that human experience is characterized by a flow of energy and information both within us (within our whole body), and between us (in the connections we have with others and with nature). In line with this framework, we focused on sensors designed to evaluate bodily processes (body sensors such as implantable sensors, epidermal sensors, and wearable and portable sensors), human social interaction (sociometric sensors), and the physical environment (indoor and outdoor ambient sensors). There is a myriad of man-made sensors as well as nature-based sensors such as plants that can be used to design and deploy intelligent systems for human monitoring and healthcare. In conclusion, sensing technologies and intelligent systems can be employed for smarter healthcare of AN and help to relieve the burden of health professionals. However, there are technical, ethical, and environmental sustainability issues that must be considered prior to implementing these systems. A joint collaboration of professionals and other members of the society involved in the healthcare of individuals with AN can help in the development of these systems. The evolution of cyberphysical systems should also be considered in these collaborations.", "Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is often associated with symptoms of heart failure (HF) during the acute phase of the disease. 3-dimensional optical coherence tomography (OCT) may be used to assess the extent of angiographically silent underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aims to use an artificial intelligence algorithm to analyze OCT findings and to determine whether the presence of pre-existing CAD predisposes TTS patients to present HF at admission.\nThis is an observational and retrospective study that enrolled TTS patients who underwent coronary angiography and OCT examination of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Plaque characterization was automatically analyzed via an artificial intelligence model from OCT images. An angiography-derived index of microcirculatory resistance (IMRangio) using the optic flow ratio (OFR) was calculated to assess its correlation with plaque volumes.\nThirty-seven patients were included (94.6 % women) with a median age of 82.0 years. Ten patients (27 %) showed some degree of HF at admission. Sixty-seven coronary non-obstructive plaques were analyzed. Tissue compositional analysis showed that patients with HF had an increased overall plaque volume (79.0 mm3 vs 28.6 mm3; p = 0.011) and longer plaque lesion length (12.8 mm vs 7.2 mm; p = 0.006). Patients with HF also showed an increased percentage of lipidic and calcified plaque tissue (26.4 % vs 13.4 %; p = 0.019 and 4.5 % vs 0.0 %; p = 0.001, respectively). A moderate positive correlation was found between global overall plaque volume and IMRangio.\nIncreased overall plaque volume was associated with the development of HF during the acute phase of TTS, suggesting that the presence of angiographically silent underlying CAD may play a prognostic role in these patients.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more widespread within radiology. Capabilities that AI algorithms currently provide include detection, segmentation, classification, and quantification of pathological findings. Artificial intelligence software have created challenges for the traditional United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process for medical devices given their abilities to evolve over time with incremental data input. Currently, there are 190 FDA-approved radiology AI-based software devices, 42 of which pertain specifically to thoracic radiology. The majority of these algorithms are approved for the detection and/or analysis of pulmonary nodules, for monitoring placement of endotracheal tubes and indwelling catheters, for detection of emergent findings, and for assessment of pulmonary parenchyma; however, as technology evolves, there are many other potential applications that can be explored. For example, evaluation of non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis interstitial lung diseases, synthesis of imaging, clinical and/or laboratory data to yield comprehensive diagnoses, and survival or prognosis prediction of certain pathologies. With increasing physician and developer engagement, transparency and frequent communication between developers and regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, AI medical devices will be able to provide a critical supplement to patient management and ultimately enhance physicians' ability to improve patient care.", "Previous atrial fibrillation screening trials have highlighted the need for more targeted approaches. We did a pragmatic study to evaluate the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm-guided targeted screening approach for identifying previously unrecognised atrial fibrillation.\nFor this non-randomised interventional trial, we prospectively recruited patients with stroke risk factors but with no known atrial fibrillation who had an electrocardiogram (ECG) done in routine practice. Participants wore a continuous ambulatory heart rhythm monitor for up to 30 days, with the data transmitted in near real time through a cellular connection. The AI algorithm was applied to the ECGs to divide patients into high-risk or low-risk groups. The primary outcome was newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. In a secondary analysis, trial participants were propensity-score matched (1:1) to individuals from the eligible but unenrolled population who served as real-world controls. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04208971.\n1003 patients with a mean age of 74 years (SD 8\u00b78) from 40 US states completed the study. Over a mean 22\u00b73 days of continuous monitoring, atrial fibrillation was detected in six (1\u00b76%) of 370 patients with low risk and 48 (7\u00b76%) of 633 with high risk (odds ratio 4\u00b798, 95% CI 2\u00b711-11\u00b775, p=0\u00b70002). Compared with usual care, AI-guided screening was associated with increased detection of atrial fibrillation (high-risk group: 3\u00b76% [95% CI 2\u00b73-5\u00b74] with usual care vs 10\u00b76% [8\u00b73-13\u00b72] with AI-guided screening, p<0\u00b70001; low-risk group: 0\u00b79% vs 2\u00b74%, p=0\u00b712) over a median follow-up of 9\u00b79 months (IQR 7\u00b71-11\u00b70).\nAn AI-guided targeted screening approach that leverages existing clinical data increased the yield for atrial fibrillation detection and could improve the effectiveness of atrial fibrillation screening.\nMayo Clinic Robert D and Patricia E Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery.", "Through the revolutionization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in clinical research, significant improvement is observed in diagnosis of cancer. Utilization of these AI technologies, such as machine and deep learning, is imperative for the discovery of novel anticancer drugs and improves existing/ongoing cancer therapeutics. However, building a model for complicated cancers and their types remains a challenge due to lack of effective therapeutics that hinder the establishment of effective computational tools. In this review, we exploit recent approaches and state-of-the-art in implementing AI methods for anticancer drug discovery, and discussed how advances in these applications need to be considered in the current cancer therapeutics. Considering the immense potential of AI, we explore molecular docking and their interactions to recognize metabolic activities that support drug design. Finally, we highlight corresponding strategies in applying machine and deep learning methods to various types of cancer with their pros and cons.", "Delay discounting (DD) indexes an individual's preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed rewards, and is considered a form of cognitive impulsivity. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that DD peaks in adolescence; longitudinal studies are needed to validate this putative developmental trend, and to determine whether DD assesses a temporary state, or reflects a more stable behavioral trait. In this study, 140 individuals aged 9-23 completed a delay discounting (DD) task and cognitive battery at baseline and every-two years thereafter, yielding five assessments over approximately 10\u00a0years. Models fit with the inverse effect of age best approximated the longitudinal trajectory of two DD measures, hyperbolic discounting (log[k]) and area under the indifference-point curve (AUC). Discounting of future rewards increased rapidly from childhood to adolescence and appeared to plateau in late adolescence for both models of DD. Participants with greater verbal intelligence and working memory displayed reduced DD across the duration of the study, suggesting a functional interrelationship between these domains and DD from early adolescence to adulthood. Furthermore, AUC demonstrated good to excellent reliability across assessment points that was superior to log(k), with both measures demonstrating acceptable stability once participants reached late adolescence. The developmental trajectories of DD we observed from childhood through young adulthood suggest that DD may index cognitive control more than reward sensitivity, and that despite modest developmental changes with maturation, AUC may be conceptualized as a trait variable related to cognitive control vs impulsivity.", "Analytical dashboards are popular in business intelligence to facilitate insight discovery with multiple charts. However, creating an effective dashboard is highly demanding, which requires users to have adequate data analysis background and be familiar with professional tools, such as Power BI. To create a dashboard, users have to configure charts by selecting data columns and exploring different chart combinations to optimize the communication of insights, which is trial-and-error. Recent research has started to use deep learning methods for dashboard generation to lower the burden of visualization creation. However, such efforts are greatly hindered by the lack of large-scale and high-quality datasets of dashboards. In this work, we propose using deep reinforcement learning to generate analytical dashboards that can use well-established visualization knowledge and the estimation capacity of reinforcement learning. Specifically, we use visualization knowledge to construct a training environment and rewards for agents to explore and imitate human exploration behavior with a well-designed agent network. The usefulness of the deep reinforcement learning model is demonstrated through ablation studies and user studies. In conclusion, our work opens up new opportunities to develop effective ML-based visualization recommenders without beforehand training datasets.", "This study aims to synthesize evidence on nurses' involvement in artificial intelligence research for managing falls in older adults.\nArtificial intelligence techniques are used to analyse health datasets to aid clinical decision making, patient care and service delivery but nurses' involvement in this area of research for managing falls in older adults remains unknown.\nA scoping review was conducted. CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLI and PubMed were searched. Results were screened against inclusion criteria. Relevant data were extracted, and studies summarized using a descriptive approach.\nThe evidence shows many artificial intelligence techniques, particularly machine learning, are used to identify falls risk factors and build predictive models that could help prevent falls in older adults, with nurses leading and participating in this research.\nFurther rigorous experimental research is needed to determine the effectiveness of algorithms in predicting aspects of falls in older adults and how to implement artificial intelligence tools in gerontological nursing practice.\nNurses should pursue interdisciplinary collaborations and educational opportunities in artificial intelligence, so they can actively contribute to research on falls management. Nurses should facilitate the collection of digital falls datasets to support this emerging research agenda and the care of older adults.", "Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) has become a minimally invasive alternative for conventional colonoscopy. Nevertheless, each CCE exam produces between 50\u00a0000 and 100\u00a0000 frames, making its analysis time-consuming and prone to errors. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) architecture with high performance in image analysis. This study aims to develop a CNN model for the identification of colonic ulcers and erosions in CCE images.\nA CNN model was designed using a database of CCE images. A total of 124 CCE exams performed between 2010 and 2020 in two centers were reviewed. For CNN development, a total of 37\u00a0319 images were extracted, 33\u00a0749 showing normal colonic mucosa and 3570 showing colonic ulcers and erosions. Datasets for CNN training, validation, and testing were created. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated regarding its sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, and area under the curve.\nThe network had a sensitivity of 96.9% and a specificity of 99.9% specific for the detection of colonic ulcers and erosions. The algorithm had an overall accuracy of 99.6%. The area under the curve was 1.00. The CNN had an image processing capacity of 90 frames per second.\nThe developed algorithm is the first CNN-based model to accurately detect ulcers and erosions in CCE images, also providing a good image processing performance. The development of these AI systems may contribute to improve both the diagnostic and time efficiency of CCE exams, facilitating CCE adoption to routine clinical practice.", "There is ample evidence to demonstrate that discrimination against several population subgroups interferes with their ability to receive optimal surgical care. This bias can take many forms, including limited access to medical services, poor quality of care, and inadequate insurance coverage. While such inequalities will require numerous cultural, ethical, and sociological solutions, artificial intelligence-based algorithms may help address the problem by detecting bias in the data sets currently being used to make medical decisions. However, such AI-based solutions are only in early development. The purpose of this commentary is to serve as a call to action to encourage investigators and funding agencies to invest in the development of these digital tools.", "The majority of what is needed to maintain life is found in the approximately 70 percent of the earth's surface that is composed of water. Water quality has been deteriorating at an alarming rate as a direct result of rapid industrialization and urbanisation, which has led to a rise in the prevalence of serious diseases. In the past, determining the quality of water was typically accomplished by employing labor-intensive, time-consuming, and statistically pricey laboratory investigations, which renders the prevalent concept of real-time monitoring meaningless. The worrisome effect of poor water quality mandates the necessity of an alternative model that is both rapid and economical to implement. There has been a lot of talk about using artificial intelligence to forecast and model water quality as a means of preventing and reducing water pollution. An artificial ecosystem optimization with Deep Learning Enabled Water Quality Prediction and Classification (AEODL-WQPC) model is presented in this paper. The primary objectives of the AEODL-WQPC model that is being given are the prediction and categorization of different levels of water quality. As a first processing step, the data normalization technique is used to the provided AEODL-WQPC model so that this goal can be achieved. In addition to this, an optimal stacked bidirectional gated recurrent unit (OSBiGRU) model is used to forecast the water quality index (WQI), and the Adam optimizer is utilised in order to fine-tune the model's parameters. AEO with enhanced Elman Neural Network (AEO-IENN) model is utilised for the categorization of water quality. This model is characterized by the fact that the AEO algorithm effectively tunes the parameters associated to the ENN model. For the purposes of the experimental validation of the AEODL-WQPC model, a benchmark water quality dataset obtained from the Kaggle repository is utilised. The research that compared several models found that the AEODL-WQPC model had superior results to more recent state of the art methods.", "Multiclass contour visualization is often used to interpret complex data attributes in such fields as weather forecasting, computational fluid dynamics, and artificial intelligence. However, effective and accurate representations of underlying data patterns and correlations can be challenging in multiclass contour visualization, primarily due to the inevitable visual cluttering and occlusions when the number of classes is significant. To address this issue, visualization design must carefully choose design parameters to make visualization more comprehensible. With this goal in mind, we proposed a framework for multiclass contour visualization. The framework has two components: a set of four visualization design parameters, which are developed based on an extensive review of literature on contour visualization, and a declarative domain-specific language (DSL) for creating multiclass contour rendering, which enables a fast exploration of those design parameters. A task-oriented user study was conducted to assess how those design parameters affect users' interpretations of real-world data. The study results offered some suggestions on the value choices of design parameters in multiclass contour visualization.", "Scientific literature demonstrated the impairment in cognitive/executive functions and pragmatic language in SLE patients, potentially involving also asymptomatic subjects. The present study focuses on the assessment in an SLE cohort of emotional intelligence, which is an ability regulated by the network of the executive functions, cognitive abilities involved in the initiation, planning, organization, and regulation of achievement-oriented behaviors: with emotional. Thus, emotional intelligence, defined as the ability to reason with emotions, was evaluated in a SLE cohort diagnosed according to the 1997 American College of Rheumatology criteria. As control healthy subjects were enrolled. The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), a skill-scale that measures the ability to perform tasks and solve emotional problems, was administered to patients and controls. Second, a group of SLE patients underwent the Visual Thinking Strategies (VTS) method in order to assess the potential impact of art in cognitive skills like critical thinking, problem solving, and emotional intelligence quotient. The protocol also included the evaluation of the improvement of some skills using a validated VTS skill grid. Self-reported scales for anxiety and depression were performed to rule out the influence of mood disorders on emotional intelligence. The present study demonstrated similar quotient scores of emotional intelligence in SLE patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, VTS method could help in improving this cognitive ability in patients, by implementing critical thinking and problem solving, promoting empathy, and improving tolerance to ambiguity and relational capacity.", "This paper describes the design philosophy for our cloud-based virtual reality (VR) co-creation environment (CCE) for molecular modeling. Using interactive VR simulation can provide enhanced perspectives in molecular modeling for intuitive live demonstration and experimentation in the CCE. Then the use of the CCE can enhance knowledge creation by bringing people together to share and create ideas or knowledge that may not emerge otherwise. Our prototype CCE discussed here, which was developed to demonstrate our design philosophy, has already enabled multiple members to log\u00a0in and touch virtual molecules running on a cloud server with no noticeable network latency via real-time artificial intelligence techniques. The CCE plays an essential role in the rational design of molecular robot parts, which consist of bio-molecules such as DNA and protein molecules.", "With an increase in the demand for smart wearable systems, artificial synapse arrays for flexible neural networks have received considerable attention. A synaptic device with a two-terminal configuration is promising for complex neural networks because of its ability to scale to a crossbar array architecture. To realize practical crossbar arrays with a high density, it is essential to achieve reliable electrode lines that act as signal terminals. However, an effective method to develop intrinsically flexible signal lines in artificial neural networks has not been developed. In this study, we achieved reliable polymer signal lines for flexible neural networks using coffee ring-free micromolding in capillaries (MIMIC). In a typical MIMIC, the outward convective flow of the polymer solution inherently deteriorates the pattern fidelity. To achieve reliable conducting polymer (CP) lines, we precisely controlled the flow of the polymer solution in the MIMIC by inducing the Marangoni force. When the convective and Marangoni flows for the solution were balanced in the MIMIC, the CP line patterns were reliably produced with high fidelity. The developed CP lines exhibited superior conductivity and high mechanical flexibility. Moreover, flexible memristor arrays consisting of CP signal lines demonstrated a high potential for realizing practical neuromorphic systems linked to artificial intelligence.", "With the development of digital media technology, its application in teaching and learning is becoming more widespread. Digital media technology helps present information in transmitting knowledge or skills, reduces cognitive load, and promotes understanding of knowledge. Evaluation of the effectiveness of digital media teaching has also become important. A scientific and reasonable evaluation of digital media teaching effectiveness can help teachers select digital media technology and grasp the amount, degree, and timing of digital media use to change teaching effectiveness. This paper proposed using a combination of big data and artificial intelligence methods to evaluate the effectiveness of digital media teaching methods using the RBF neural network model. The digital media teaching effectiveness evaluation was used as the input variable of RBF, the degree of digital media effectiveness was the output variable and the neural network was trained through the collected sample data. The research results showed that the RBF neural network model proposed in this paper has a strong generalization and extension ability in evaluating digital media teaching effectiveness, providing a new way to evaluate digital media teaching effectiveness.", "The quality of talent has increased across all fields due to the constant growth of different industries and the growing job saturation. Real-time job information on recruitment platforms can, therefore, accurately reflect the demand for talent from businesses, serving as a basis for the creation of training policies in schools. In international competition, the development of talents, especially top-level talents, will become more and more crucial. Growing in importance is China's economy and social development. The evaluation of higher vocational and technical talents, however, should also be assessed from a variety of angles, given the diversification of talent training objectives and teaching methods, as well as the expansion of teaching functions. An emerging machine learning technology called deep learning (DL) has been developed to bring machine learning closer to the goals of artificial intelligence. This essay offers a thorough evaluation of the depth of deep learning as it relates to the development of innovative talent in schools. The entire school must be strengthened. It is demonstrated that the average execution time is slashed by 0.0024\u2009s, and the learning sample size error of the DL model is reduced by 0.05276 when compared to the Apriori method. As a result, implementing and researching the DL model can significantly improve both the overall teaching quality of schools and their capacity for innovation.", "Gastrointestinal cancers account for 22.5% of cancer related deaths worldwide and represent circa 20% of all cancers. In the last decades, we have witnessed a shift from histology-based to molecular-based classifications using genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data. The molecular based classification revealed new prognostic markers and may aid the therapy selection. Because of the high-costs to perform a molecular classification, in recent years immunohistochemistry-based surrogate classification were developed which permit the stratification of patients, and in parallel multiple groups developed hematoxylin and eosin whole slide image analysis for sub-classifying these entities. Hence, we are witnessing a return to an image-based classification with the purpose to infer hidden information from routine histology images that would permit to detect the patients that respond to specific therapies and would be able to predict their outcome. In this review paper, we will discuss the current histological, molecular, and immunohistochemical classifications of the most common gastrointestinal cancers, gastric adenocarcinoma, and colorectal adenocarcinoma, and will present key aspects for developing a new artificial intelligence aided image-based classification of these malignancies.", "Lung diseases are serious threats to human health and life, therefore, an accurate diagnosis of lung diseases is significant. The use of artificial intelligence to analyze lung sounds can aid in diagnosing lung diseases. Most of the existing lung sound recognition methods ignore the correlation between the time-domain and frequency-domain information of the lung sounds. Additionally, the spectrograms used in these models do not adequately capture the detailed features of the lung sounds. This paper proposes a model based on wavelet feature enhancement and time-frequency synchronous modeling, comprising a dual wavelet analysis module (DWAM), a cubic network, and an attention module. DWAM in the model performed a dual wavelet transformation on the spectrograms to extract the detailed features of the lung sounds. The cubic network comprised multiple cubic gated recursive units to capture the correlation of the time-frequency of the lung sounds using the time-frequency synchronous modeling. The attention module, which includes temporal and channel attention, was used to enhance the time-domain and channel dimension features. In the combined dataset and the International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics 2017 dataset, the suggested framework outperforms existing models by more than 1.36% and 4.28%, respectively.", "The application of artificial intelligence has realized the transformation of people's production and lifestyle, and also promoted the progress of physical education and comprehensive health quality. The application of artificial intelligence in the current physical education movement is increasing. By utilizing its advanced method of virtual simulation technology, the purpose of this paper is to realize the interventional research on the physical education movement and comprehensive health quality in the environment of artificial intelligence. This paper proposes to use the virtual simulation technology and Kinect algorithm in artificial intelligence to design the virtual sports simulation teaching mode. The functional module design part where the Kinect algorithm helps the teaching of virtual sports simulation experiments, which is helpful to analyze and solve the objective system imbalance and ecological imbalance in online physical education teaching. By using the principles and rules of the Mean Shift image segmentation algorithm for reference, the investigation and research on the comprehensive health quality of students are carried out, so as to realize the ecologicalization of the virtual sports school. In the investigation and research on the comprehensive quality of students, the results show that the overall quality of these students who has reached the level of qualified or unqualified is accounting for about 30% of the total number. It is worth noting that in terms of scientific and cultural quality, only 43.34% of all students have excellent grades. It can be seen that the important training goal of current school research is how to use reasonable and effective methods and strategies to improve students' scientific and cultural level, and improve students' other comprehensive scores at the same time.", "In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, growing evidence has accumulated about long-term outcomes of first-line treatments. Our objective was to perform indirect comparisons across first-line treatments.\nWe applied the Shiny method, an artificial intelligence technique that analyses Kaplan-Meier curves and reconstructs patient-level data. Reconstructed patient data were then evaluated through standard survival statistics and indirect head-to-head comparisons. The endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).\nSeven first-line treatments were studied (1983 patients). Three treatments based on either ibrutinib or venetoclax (i.e., ibrutinib monotherapy, ibrutinib+ rituximab/obinutuzumab, and venetoclax+obinutuzumab) showed a very similar survival pattern. The PFS for these three treatments was significantly better than that of the remaining four treatments (fludarabine+cyclophosphamide+rituximab, chlorambucil+obinutuzumab, bendamustine+rituximab, and chlorambucil monotherapy). Regarding chlorambucil+ obinutuzumab, a significant between-trial variability was found.\nLong-term results are particularly favorable to ibrutinib (alone or in combination) and discourage further use of chlorambucil. As in other studies based on the Shiny method, the multi-treatment Kaplan-Meier graph summarized the available evidence in comparative terms. The evidence generated this way contributes to define the place in therapy of individual agents.", "Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common reasons for disability globally. Digital interventions are a promising means of supporting people to self-manage LBP, but implementation of digital interventions has been suboptimal. An artificial intelligence-driven app, selfBACK, was developed to support self-management of LBP as an adjunct to usual care. To better understand the process of implementation from a participant perspective, we qualitatively explored factors influencing embedding, integrating, and sustaining engagement with the selfBACK app, and the self-perceived effects, acceptability, and satisfaction with the selfBACK app.\nUsing a qualitative interview study and an analytic framework approach underpinned by Normalization Process Theory (NPT), we investigated the experiences of patients who participated in the selfBACK randomized controlled trial (RCT). Interviews focused on the motivation to participate in the RCT, experiences of using the selfBACK app, and views about future intended use and potential of using digital health interventions for self-management of LBP. Participants were purposively sampled to represent diversity in age, sex, and implementation reflected by a proxy measure of number of app-generated self-management plans during the first three months of RCT participation.\nTwenty-six participants aged 21-78, eleven females and fifteen men, with two to fourteen self-management plans, were interviewed between August 2019 and April 2020. A broad range of factors influencing implementation of selfBACK within all constructs of NPT were identified. Key facilitating factors were preferences and beliefs favoring self-management, a friendly, motivational, and reassuring supporter, tailoring and personalization, convenience and ease of use, trustworthiness, perceiving benefits, and tracking achievements. Key impeding factors were preferences and beliefs not favoring self-management, functionality issues, suboptimal tailoring and personalization, insufficient time or conflicting life circumstances, not perceiving benefits, and insufficient involvement of health care practitioners. Self-perceived effects on pain and health, behavior/attitude, and gaining useful knowledge varied by participant.\nThe high prevalence of LBP globally coupled with the advantages of providing help through an app offers opportunities to help countless people. A range of factors should be considered to facilitate implementation of self-management of LBP or similar pain conditions using digital health tools.", "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) proliferates across important social institutions, many of the most powerful AI systems available are difficult to interpret for end-users and engineers alike. Here, we sought to characterize public attitudes towards AI interpretability. Across seven studies (N\u2009=\u20092475), we demonstrate robust and positive attitudes towards interpretable AI among non-experts that generalize across a variety of real-world applications and follow predictable patterns. Participants value interpretability positively across different levels of AI autonomy and accuracy, and rate interpretability as more important for AI decisions involving high stakes and scarce resources. Crucially, when AI interpretability trades off against AI accuracy, participants prioritize accuracy over interpretability under the same conditions driving positive attitudes towards interpretability in the first place: amidst high stakes and scarce resources. These attitudes could drive a proliferation of AI systems making high-impact ethical decisions that are difficult to explain and understand.", "This study aimed to develop a deep learning model to generate a postoperative corneal axial curvature map of femtosecond laser arcuate keratotomy (FLAK) based on corneal tomography using a pix2pix conditional generative adversarial network (pix2pix cGAN) for surgical planning.\nA total of 451 eyes of 318 nonconsecutive patients were subjected to FLAK for corneal astigmatism correction during cataract surgery. Paired or single anterior penetrating FLAKs were performed at an 8.0-mm optical zone with a depth of 90% using a femtosecond laser (LenSx laser, Alcon Laboratories, Inc.). Corneal tomography images were acquired from Oculus Pentacam HR (Optikger\u00e4te GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) before and 3 months after the surgery. The raw data required for analysis consisted of the anterior corneal curvature for a range of \u00b1 3.5 mm around the corneal apex in 0.1-mm steps, which the pseudo-color corneal curvature map synthesized was based on. The deep learning model used was a pix2pix conditional generative adversarial network. The prediction accuracy of synthetic postoperative corneal astigmatism in zones of different diameters centered on the corneal apex was assessed using vector analysis. The synthetic postoperative corneal axial curvature maps were compared with the real postoperative corneal axial curvature maps using the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).\nA total of 386 pairs of preoperative and postoperative corneal tomography data were included in the training set, whereas 65 preoperative data were retrospectively included in the test set. The correlation coefficient between synthetic and real postoperative astigmatism (difference vector) in the 3-mm zone was 0.89, and that between surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) was 0.93. The mean absolute errors of SIA for real and synthetic postoperative corneal axial curvature maps in the 1-, 3-, and 5-mm zone were 0.20 \u00b1 0.25, 0.12 \u00b1 0.17, and 0.09 \u00b1 0.13 diopters, respectively. The average SSIM and PSNR of the 3-mm zone were 0.86 \u00b1 0.04 and 18.24 \u00b1 5.78, respectively.\nOur results showed that the application of pix2pix cGAN can synthesize plausible postoperative corneal tomography for FLAK, showing the possibility of using GAN to predict corneal tomography, with the potential of applying artificial intelligence to construct surgical planning models.", "The purpose of this study is to investigate how the use of artificial intelligence is associated with the retention of elderly caregivers.\nThe turnover of elderly caregivers is high and increasing. Elderly care institutions are beginning to use artificial intelligence to support caregivers in their work, and the use of technology is critical to staff retention. Empowerment of elderly caregivers has been neglected by managers and researchers.\nThis cross-sectional study involved 511 elderly caregivers in 25 elderly institutions. Six validated standardized scales were used for data collection, and the software SPSS and SmartPLS were used for data analysis.\nThe quality of artificial intelligence\u00a0has a significant positive effect on empowerment. Artificial intelligence psychological empowerment (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.355, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and artificial intelligence structural empowerment (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.375, p\u2009<\u2009.001) both had positive effects on retention intention, and the jointly explained variance (R2 ) was 42.6%.\nThe results show that a significant relationship exists between artificial intelligence empowerment and retention intention. Elderly caregivers with more structural empowerment have higher retention intention.\nArtificial intelligence suppliers need to pay attention to the role of product quality in elderly care services, continuously improve artificial intelligence quality, and strengthen the application and routine maintenance of artificial intelligence technologies. Elderly care institution managers should pay special attention to artificial intelligence structural empowerment (such as artificial intelligence-related education and training, learning and development opportunities, and resource support).", "Fabry disease is a congenital lysosomal storage disease, and most of these cases develop organ damage in middle age. There are some promising therapeutic options for this disorder, which can stabilize the progression of the disease. However, a long delay in diagnosis prevents early intervention, resulting in treatment failure. Because Fabry disease is a rare disease, it is not well recognized and disease specific screening tests are rarely performed. Hence, a novel approach to for detecting patients with a widely practiced clinical test is crucial for the early detection of the disease. Recently, decision support systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed in many clinical fields. However, the construction of these models requires datasets from a large number of samples; this aspect is one of the main obstacles in AI-based approaches for rare diseases. In this study, with a novel image amplification method to construct the dataset for AI-model training, we built the deep neural-network model to detect Fabry cases from their urine samples. Sensitivity, specificity, and the AUC of the models on validation dataset were 0.902 (95% CI, 0.900-0.903), 0.977 (0.950-0.980), and 0.968 (0.964-0.972), respectively. This model could also extract disease-specific findings that are interpretable with human recognition. These results indicate that we can apply novel AI models for rare diseases based on this image amplification method we developed. We expect this approach could contribute to the diagnosis of Fabry disease.\nThis is the first reported AI-based decision support system to detect undiagnosed Fabry cases, and our new image amplification method will contribute to the AI models for other rare disorders.", "Given the fundamental role of emotional intelligence (EI) in learning, especially in virtual learning contexts where individuals experience more stress and anxiety, the need to understand and recognize one's own feelings and the mutual feelings of peers has gained more importance. Flow as the ultimate state in harnessing emotions in the service of performance and learning has been introduced as the main reason for one's willingness to perform activities which are connected to no external motivation. In this regard, the present study was conducted to first introduce a new educational program to enhance the EI level in the English as a foreign language (EFL) online education environment and next to investigate the possibility of raising EFL learners' perceived flow. To achieve these goals, the study recruited a sample of 67 EFL learners who were next divided into experimental (n = 32) and control (n = 35) groups. The experimental group received the EI intervention over 10 weeks and the control group received the ordinary online EFL instruction. Data were collected through EI and flow questionnaires and semi-structured interviews which focused on learners' perception of the EI intervention and signs of enhanced flow. Statistical analysis of the data showed a positive effect of the program on the learners' EI and their perceived flow. The study emphasizes the role of applying positive emotions in making language learners more engaged in online classroom tasks.", "Automated neuropsychiatric batteries have been used in research and clinical practice, including for chronic diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. The Pediatric Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics battery (Ped-ANAM), originally developed for use in American-English speaking individuals, allows tracking of cognitive functions. It can be applied to people over 9 years old. The aim of this study was to translate and present initial validation data from the Ped-ANAM into Brazilian-Portuguese. We translated the battery according to Beaton's guidelines. Psychometric properties were tested, internal consistency was analyzed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient, test-retest reliability by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Further, we measured the test execution speed at both times as a temporal stability. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for structural validity. Evidence of construct validity was assessed through assessment of the relationships with the Wechsler Intelligence Scales. All participants prior to the start of study related activities signed an informed consent form approved by the local ethics committee. A sample of 230 individuals [mean (range) of age: 23 (9 to 60) years; 65% females] was included; a subset of 51 individuals [mean (range) of age: 18 (9 to 57) years, 59% female] completed the Ped-ANAM twice to assess test-retest reliability, and another subset of 54 individuals [mean (range) of age: 20.4 (7 to 62) years; 67% female] completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children and Adult for assessment of the Ped-ANAM's construct validity. Our results suggest that the internal consistency of the Ped-ANAM (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.890) and its subtest test-retest reliability were excellent (ICC: 0.59 to 0.94). There was no clustering in the Principal Components Analysis, suggestive of non-grouping of the evaluated variables. Construct validity assessment to the Wechsler Scales showed expected ranges of low to strong correlations (Spearman correlations: \u03c1 = 0.40 to \u03c1 = 0.69). We concluded that, based on the results of this study, a cross-culturally validated Brazilian-Portuguese version of the Ped-ANAM has been developed and it is a reliable tool for the screening cognitive function.", "Fibrosis is a disease that damages organs and even causes death. Because of the complicated pathogenesis, the development of drugs for fibrosis is challenging. In the lysophosphatidic acid receptor type 1 (LPA1) signaling pathway, LPA1 and its downstream Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK) are related to the process of fibrosis. Targeting LPA1 signaling pathway is a potential strategy for the treatment of fibrosis.\nThis review describes the process of fibrosis mediated by the LPA1 signaling pathway and then summarizes LPA1 antagonist patents reported since 2010 and ROCK inhibitor patents since 2017 according to their scaffolds based on the Cortellis Drug Discovery Intelligence database. Information on LPA1 antagonists entering clinical trials is integrated.\nOver the past decade, a large number of antagonists targeting the LPA1 signaling pathway have been patented for fibrosis therapy. A limited number of compounds have entered clinical trials. Different companies and research groups have used different scaffolds when designing compounds for fibrosis therapy. Therefore, LPA1 and ROCK are competitive targets for the development of new therapies for fibrosis to provide a potential treatment method for fibrosis in the future.", "This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify normal chest radiography (CXR) from the worklist of radiologists in a health-screening environment.\nThis retrospective simulation study was conducted using the CXRs of 5887 adults (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 55.4 \u00b1 11.8 years; male, 4329) from three health screening centers in South Korea using a commercial AI (Lunit INSIGHT CXR3, version 3.5.8.8). Three board-certified thoracic radiologists reviewed CXR images for referable thoracic abnormalities and grouped the images into those with visible referable abnormalities (identified as abnormal by at least one reader) and those with clearly visible referable abnormalities (identified as abnormal by at least two readers). With AI-based simulated exclusion of normal CXR images, the percentages of normal images sorted and abnormal images erroneously removed were analyzed. Additionally, in a random subsample of 480 patients, the ability to identify visible referable abnormalities was compared among AI-unassisted reading (i.e., all images read by human readers without AI), AI-assisted reading (i.e., all images read by human readers with AI assistance as concurrent readers), and reading with AI triage (i.e., human reading of only those rendered abnormal by AI).\nOf 5887 CXR images, 405 (6.9%) and 227 (3.9%) contained visible and clearly visible abnormalities, respectively. With AI-based triage, 42.9% (2354/5482) of normal CXR images were removed at the cost of erroneous removal of 3.5% (14/405) and 1.8% (4/227) of CXR images with visible and clearly visible abnormalities, respectively. In the diagnostic performance study, AI triage removed 41.6% (188/452) of normal images from the worklist without missing visible abnormalities and increased the specificity for some readers without decreasing sensitivity.\nThis study suggests the feasibility of sorting and removing normal CXRs using AI with a tailored cut-off to increase efficiency and reduce the workload of radiologists.", "Generalization (or transfer) is the ability to repurpose knowledge in novel settings. It is often asserted that generalization is an important ingredient of human intelligence, but its extent, nature, and determinants have proved controversial. Here, we examine this ability with a paradigm that formalizes the transfer learning problem as one of recomposing existing functions to solve unseen problems. We find that people can generalize compositionally in ways that are elusive for standard neural networks and that human generalization benefits from training regimes in which items are axis aligned and temporally correlated. We describe a neural network model based around a Hebbian gating process that can capture how human generalization benefits from different training curricula. We additionally find that adult humans tend to learn composable functions asynchronously, exhibiting discontinuities in learning that resemble those seen in child development.", "We aimed to develop a Radiological-Radiomics (R-R) based model for predicting the high-grade pattern (HGP) of lung adenocarcinoma and evaluate its predictive performance.\nThe clinical, pathological, and imaging data of 374 patients pathologically confirmed with lung adenocarcinoma (374 lesions in total) were retrospectively analyzed. The 374 lesions were assigned to HGP (n = 81) and non-high-grade pattern (n-HGP, n = 293) groups depending on the presence or absence of high-grade components in pathological findings. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was utilized to screen features on the United Imaging artificial intelligence scientific research platform, and logistic regression models for predicting HGP were constructed, namely, Radiological model, Radiomics model, and R-R model. Also, receiver operating curve (ROC) curves were plotted on the platform, generating corresponding area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Using the platform, nomograms for R-R models were also provided, and calibration curves and decision curves were drawn to evaluate the performance and clinical utility of the model. The statistical differences in the performance of the models were compared by the DeLong test.\nThe R-R model for HGP prediction achieved an AUC value of 0.923 (95% CI: 0.891-0.948), a sensitivity of 87.0%, a specificity of 83.4%, and an accuracy of 84.2% in the training set. In the validation set, this model exhibited an AUC value of 0.920 (95% CI: 0.887-0.945), a sensitivity of 87.5%, a specificity of 83.3%, and an accuracy of 84.2%. The DeLong test demonstrated optimal performance of the R-R model among the three models, and decision curves validated the clinical utility of the R-R model.\nIn this study, we developed a fusion model using radiomic features combined with radiological features to predict the high-grade pattern of lung adenocarcinoma, and this model shows excellent diagnostic performance. The R-R model can provide certain guidance for clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment plans, contributing to improving the prognosis of patients.", "To explore the application values of deep-learning based artificial intelligence (AI) automatic classification system, on the differential diagnosis of non-lactating mastitis (NLM) and malignant breast tumors, via its comparation with traditional ultrasound interpretations and the following interpretation conclusions made by the sonographers with various seniorities.\nA total of 707 patients suffering from breast lesions (475 malignant breast tumors and 232 NLM), were selected from the following three medical centers, including Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hebei Province Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Yantai Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, and the time period was set from April 2020 to September 2021. All selected cases firstly accepted the routine breast ultrasound diagnosis, followed by the interpretations from a senior sonographer with more than 15 years of work experience, and an intermediate-aged sonographer with more than 5 years of work experience, independently. Meanwhile, a third physician also interpreted the same ultrasound images by deep learning-based AI automatic classification system, independent of the interpretation results from the previous two physicians. The kappa test was performed to evaluate the consistency between the conventional ultrasound interpretation results and pathological results interpreted from physicians with different working experiences.\nIn total, 475 cases of malignant breast tumors (512 nodules) and 232 cases of NLM (255 nodules) were pathologically diagnosed. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of conventional ultrasound interpretations vary from different sonographers with different working experiences. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for intermediate-aged sonographers and senior sonographers were 76.92% (590/767), 84.71% (216/255), and 73.95% (374/512) and 87.35% (670/767), 86.27% (220/255), and 87.89% (450/512), respectively (P<0.001). In contrast, if the threshold was set as 0.5, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity from deep learning-based AI automatic classification system were 83.00%, 87.20%, and 85.33%, separately, and the area under the curve was 92.6. The results of the kappa consistency test indicated that the diagnosis results from the image interpretations by senior physicians and deep-learning based AI automatic classification system showed high consistency with postoperative pathological diagnosis results, and the kappa values are 0.72 and 0.71, respectively, with the P-value of less than 0.001. In contrast, the consistency between the image interpretation results from intermediate-aged physicians with less working experience, and postoperative pathological diagnosis results, seemed to be relatively lower, with a kappa value of only 0.53 and P-value of less than 0.001.\nThe deep learning-based AI automatic classification system is expected to become a reliable auxiliary way to distinguish NLM and malignant breast tumors due to its high sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity.", "Orthokeratology (ortho-k) is an overnight clinical contact lens wear technique to correct myopia and to reduce myopia progression wearing reverse-geometry rigid gas-permeable lenses. The lens fitting procedure in clinical practice usually requires subjective assessment of fluorescein pattern (fluorescein \"bull's eye\" pattern). The aim of this study was to develop a novel tool for fluorescein pattern measurements to reduce subjective practitioner dependency, especially in inexperienced practitioners, in ortho-k practice.\nA new MATLAB customized algorithm to measure the horizontal width of the four main zones of ortho-k fluorescein patterns (central bearing, tear reservoir, mid-peripheral bearing and edge lift) was designed. The algorithm was tested on a small image database consisting of 26 ortho-k fluorescein pattern images of 13 volunteers fitted with reverse geometry lenses (Seefree, Conoptica-Hecht Contactlinsen). The agreement between two independent observers and the ImageJ measurements was determined.\nThe new clinical tool provided similar measurements to ImageJ software for the central bearing (4.20 \u00b1 0.74 and 4.27 \u00b1 0.69 mm; P = 0.21), tear reservoir (1.69 \u00b1 0.41 and 1.69 \u00b1 0.45 mm; P = 0.69), mid-peripheral bearing (1.17 \u00b1 0.11 and 1.13 \u00b1 0.10 mm; P < 0.01) and edge lift (0.48 \u00b1 0.06 and 0.48 \u00b1 0.06 mm; P = 0.81) zones. Good agreement between the software (limits of agreement lower than \u00b10.55 mm) and inter-observer measurements (limits of agreement lower than \u00b10.66 mm) was found.\nThe proposed clinical tool for semiautomatic fluorescein pattern measurements in ortho-k could help to reduce practitioner dependency in fluorescein pattern assessment with future potential to introduce prediction algorithms or artificial intelligence methods in myopia control management.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen as a major disrupting force in the future healthcare system. However, the assessment of the value of AI technologies is still unclear. Therefore, a multidisciplinary group of experts and patients developed a Model for ASsessing the value of AI (MAS-AI) in medical imaging. Medical imaging is chosen due to the maturity of AI in this area, ensuring a robust evidence-based model.\nMAS-AI was developed in three phases. First, a literature review of existing guides, evaluations, and assessments of the value of AI in the field of medical imaging. Next, we interviewed leading researchers in AI in Denmark. The third phase consisted of two workshops where decision makers, patient organizations, and researchers discussed crucial topics for evaluating AI. The multidisciplinary team revised the model between workshops according to comments.\nThe MAS-AI guideline consists of two steps covering nine domains and five process factors supporting the assessment. Step 1 contains a description of patients, how the AI model was developed, and initial ethical and legal considerations. In step 2, a multidisciplinary assessment of outcomes of the AI application is done for the five remaining domains: safety, clinical aspects, economics, organizational aspects, and patient aspects.\nWe have developed an health technology assessment-based framework to support the introduction of AI technologies into healthcare in medical imaging. It is essential to ensure informed and valid decisions regarding the adoption of AI with a structured process and tool. MAS-AI can help support decision making and provide greater transparency for all parties.", "With our aging population, many individuals are at risk of developing age-related cognitive decline. Physical exercise has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive performance in aging adults. This study examined the effects of 8 weeks of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance and cardiorespiratory fitness in sedentary aging adults at risk for cognitive decline.\nFifty-two participants (age 62.9 \u00b1 6.8, 76.9% female) engaged in eight weeks of moderate-to high-intensity exercise (19 in-person, 33 remotely). Global cognition was measured by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Fourth Edition. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured via heart rate recovery at minute 1 (HRR1) and 2 (HRR2), and exercise engagement (defined as percent of total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). We measured pre and post changes using paired t-tests and mixed effects models, and investigated the association between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance using multiple regression models. Cohen's d were calculated to estimate effect sizes.\nOverall, 63.4 % of participants demonstrated high engagement (\u2265 70% total exercise time spent in the prescribed heart rate zone). There were significant pre-post improvements in verbal fluency and verbal memory, and a significant decrement in working memory, but these were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d <0.5). Concerning cardiorespiratory fitness, there was a pre-to-post significant improvement in HRR1 (p = 0.01, d = 0.30) and HRR2 (p < 0.001, d = 0.50). Multiple regressions revealed significant associations between cardiorespiratory and cognitive performance, but all were associated with small effect sizes (Cohen's d < 0.5). Interestingly, there were significant between-group differences in exercise engagement (all p < 0.001), with remote participants demonstrating greater exercise engagement than in-person participants.\nImprovements in cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness were observed after 8 weeks of moderate to high-intensity exercise in aging adults. These results suggest that committing to a regular exercise regimen, even for a brief two-month period, can promote improvements in both cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive performance, and that improvements are driven by exercise engagement.", "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) definitions in adolescents based on the percentiles of its components are rather complicated to use in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to test the validity of artificial intelligence (AI)-based scores (AI_METS) that do not use these percentiles for MetS screening for adolescents.\nThis study included 1086 adolescents aged 12 to 18. The cohort underwent anthropometric measurements and blood tests. Mean blood pressure (MBP), and triglyceride glucose index (TyG) were calculated. Explainable AI methods are used to extract the learned function. Gini importance techniques were tested and used to build new scores for the screening of MetS. IDF, Cook, De Ferranti, Viner, and Weiss definitions of MetS were used to test the validity of these scores. MetS prevalence was 0.4%-4.7% according to these definitions. AI_METS used age, waist circumference, MBP, and TyG index. They offer area under the curves (AUCs) 0.91, 0.93, 0.89, 0.93, and 0.98; specificity 81%, 75%, 72%, 80%, and 97%; and sensitivity 90%, 100%, 90%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, for the detection of MetS according to these definitions. Considering only MBP offers a better specificity and sensitivity to detect MetS than considering only TyG index. MBP offers slightly lower performance than AI_METS.\nAI techniques have proven their ability to extract knowledge from data. They allowed us to generate new scores for MetS detection in adolescents without using specific percentiles for each component. Although these scores are less intuitive than the percentile-based definition, their accuracy is rather effective for the detection of MetS.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing discipline in the field of chemical toxicology. Herein, we provide a broad overview of research presented at the Fall 2022 American Chemical Society meeting, highlighting how AI is being applied across various facets of drug design, development, and safety assessment.", "Not only has artificial intelligence changed the production methods of traditional industries; it has also presented a great opportunity for future industrial development to decouple from environmental degradation and the promotion of green economic growth. The article studies the influence of artificial intelligence on green economic growth and its mechanism. The research shows that (1) artificial intelligence can promote green economic growth in China. After accounting for spatial factors, it was found that artificial intelligence could promote local green economic growth, but had a siphon effect on neighboring green economic growth. From the perspective of dynamic effects, in the short term, artificial intelligence will not significantly dampen green economic growth in neighboring regions. In the long run, artificial intelligence will have a stronger role in promoting green economic growth, and the siphon effect on neighboring cities will be more significant. (2) As the level of human capital increases, the negative spillover effect of artificial intelligence will be significantly weakened. The promotion effect of artificial intelligence on green economic growth is relatively weak in resource-based cities. (3) Artificial intelligence has obvious attenuation characteristics on the spatial spillover effect of green economic growth, but significant influence is limited to within 200\u00a0km. (4) Artificial intelligence has the greatest impact on productivity, accounting for 30.59% in promoting green economic growth. The green innovation effect was 0.0181, accounting for 5.64%. The resource allocation effect is 0.0011, accounting for 3.44%. This paper provides policy enlightenment for promoting industrial intelligence and green economic growth.", "We describe the curation, annotation methodology, and characteristics of the dataset used in an artificial intelligence challenge for detection and localization of COVID-19 on chest radiographs. The chest radiographs were annotated by an international group of radiologists into four mutually exclusive categories, including \"typical,\" \"indeterminate,\" and \"atypical appearance\" for COVID-19, or \"negative for pneumonia,\" adapted from previously published guidelines, and bounding boxes were placed on airspace opacities. This dataset and respective annotations are available to researchers for academic and noncommercial use.", "While interest in artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been renewed by the ubiquitous use of deep learning to solve high-dimensional problems, we are still far from general artificial intelligence. In this article, we address the problem of emergent cognitive capabilities and, more crucially, of their detection, by relying on co-evolving creatures with mutable morphology and neural structure. The former is implemented via both static and mobile structures whose shapes are controlled by cubic splines. The latter uses ESHyperNEAT to discover not only appropriate combinations of connections and weights but also to extrapolate hidden neuron distribution. The creatures integrate low-level perceptions (touch/pain proprioceptors, retina-based vision, frequency-based hearing) to inform their actions. By discovering a functional mapping between individual neurons and specific stimuli, we extract a high-level module-based abstraction of a creature's brain. This drastically simplifies the discovery of relationships between naturally occurring events and their neural implementation. Applying this methodology to creatures resulting from solitary and tag-team co-evolution showed remarkable dynamics such as range-finding and structured communication. Such discovery was made possible by the abstraction provided by the modular ANN which allowed groups of neurons to be viewed as functionally enclosed entities.", "Thyroid nodule is a common and frequently occurring disease in the neck in recent years, and ultrasound has become the preferred imaging diagnosis method for thyroid nodule due to its advantages of noninvasive, nonradiation, real-time, and repeatable. The thyroid imaging, reporting and data system (TI-RADS) classification standard scores suspicious nodules that are difficult to determine benign and malignant as grade 4, and further pathological puncture is recommended clinically, which may lead to a large number of unnecessary biopsies and operations. Including conventional ultrasound, ACR TI-RADS, shear wave elastography, super microvascular imaging, contrast enhanced ultrasound, \"firefly,\" artificial intelligence, and multimodal ultrasound imaging used in combination. In order to identify the most clinically significant malignant tumors when reducing invasive operations.

This article reviews and quantitatively analyzes the literature on wayfinding in healthcare facilities and collates the research trends and hotspots in this area.\nThe article used bibliometric analysis to search keywords in the Scopus database in the TITLE-ABS-KEY format. In total, 2359 articles were finally collated between 1974 and 2020 after three screening exercises, and a co-citation analysis was conducted by VOSviewer literature visualization analysis software.\nResearch in the worldwide literature on wayfinding in healthcare facilities has grown steadily year on year since 2002. Computer science (21.5%) and social science (15.5%) are the most common subject categories, with the United States (N = 767) accounting for the largest proportion of research. \"Lecture Notes In Computer Science Including Subseries Lecture Notes In Artificial Intelligence And Lecture Notes In Bioinformatics\" is the most active journal in terms of publications (N = 169).\nWayfinding cognition, wayfinding behavior, and individual and group differences are currently the focus of research in the field of healthcare facilities. Future research on wayfinding in healthcare facilities will further investigate intelligent assistive technologies and universal designs such as universal signage systems. In addition, cross-cultural-based wayfinding research is a hot topic for future studies where the boundaries of research are broadened and have practical value.", "Individuals with high risk of internet gaming disorder (HIGD) showed abnormal psychological performances in response inhibition, impulse control, and emotion regulation, and are considered the high-risk stage of internet gaming disorder (IGD). The identification of this population mainly relies on clinical scales, which are less accurate. This study aimed to explore whether these performances have highly accurate for discriminating HIGD from low-risk ones. Eye tracking based anti-saccade task, Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS), and Wong and Law emotional intelligence scale (WLEIS) were used to evaluate psychological performances in 57 individuals with HIGD and 52 matched low risk of internet gaming disorder (LIGD). HIGD group showed significantly increased BIS total (t\u2009=\u2009-2.875, p\u2009= 0.005), attention (t\u2009=\u2009-2.139, p\u2009= 0.035), motor (t\u2009=\u2009-2.017, p\u2009= 0.046), and non-planning (t\u2009=\u2009-2.171, p\u2009= 0.032) scores, but significantly decreased WLEIS emotion regulation score (t\u2009=\u20092.636, p\u2009= 0.010) and correct rate of eye tracking anti-saccade task (t\u2009=\u20092.294, p\u2009= 0.024) compared with LIGD group. BIS total score was negatively correlated with the WLEIS total (r\u2009=\u2009-0.473, p\u2009< 0.001) and WLEIS emotion regulation (r\u2009=\u2009-0.366, p\u2009< 0.001) scores. A combination of the WLEIS emotion regulation score and the correct rate of anti-saccade task could discriminate HIGD from LIGD with 91.23% sensitivity, 82.69% specificity, and 87.16% accuracy. Participants with higher gaming hours daily were 40 times more likely to be high risk than their counterparts (p\u2009< 0.001). Hence, psychological performances were worse in HIGD. A combination of abnormal emotion regulation and response inhibition might be a potential marker to identify HIGD individuals.", "This is a foundational study in which multiorgan system point of care ultrasound (POCUS) and machine learning (ML) are used to mimic physician management decisions regarding the functional intravascular volume status (IVS) and need for diuretic therapy. We present this as an impactful use case of an application of ML in aided decision making for clinical practice. IVS represents complex physiologic interactions of the cardiac, renal, pulmonary, and other organ systems. In particular, we focus on vascular congestion and overload as an evolving concept in POCUS diagnosis and clinical relevance. It is critical for physicians to be able to evaluate IVS without disrupting workflow or exposing patients to unnecessary testing, radiation, or cost. This work utilized a small retrospective dataset as a feasibility test for ML binary classification of diuretic administration validated with clinical decision data. Future work will be directed toward artificial intelligence (AI) delivery at the bedside and assessment of the impact on patient-centered outcomes and physician workflow improvement.\nWe retrospectively reviewed and processed 1039 POCUS video clips, including cardiac, thoracic, and inferior vena cava (IVC) views. Multiorgan POCUS clips were correlated with clinical data extracted from the electronic health record and deidentified for algorithm training and validation. We implemented a two-stream three-dimensional (3D) deep learning approach that fuses heart and IVC data to perform binary classification of the need for diuretic use.\nOur proposed approach achieves high classification accuracy (84%) for the determination of diuretic use with 0.84 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.\nOur two-stream 3D deep neural network is able to classify POCUS video clips that match physicians' classification for or against diuretic use with high accuracy. This serves as a foundational step in the progress toward AI-aided diagnosis and AI implementation in the field of IVS evaluation by POCUS.", "This study explored a set of psychological and socio-demographic factors in childhood and adulthood associated with migraines assessed at age 42\u00a0years. Data were drawn from a large, nationally representative, prospective longitudinal study: the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70). In total, 5628 cohort members with data on parental social class at birth, cognitive ability (intelligence), self-esteem and locus of control at age 10\u00a0years, psychological distress and educational qualifications at age 34, and current occupation at age 42\u00a0years were examined. We assessed whether or not they regularly experienced migraines at age 42\u00a0years. Logistic regression analysis showed that childhood migraine, gender and adult psychological distress, as well as childhood locus of control (for females only), were significant and independent predictors of the prevalence of migraine in adulthood. Childhood migraine seemed to have a long-lasting effect on adult migraine, and psychological distress also appeared to detrimentally affect adult migraine over time.", "As an extension of traditional bullying behavior, cyberbullying behavior emerges with the increasing popularity of the internet, and seriously affects the health of middle school students. However, just a few studies have explored the impact of the school factor on cyberbullying and its underlying mechanisms. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the potential mediator (i.e., self-esteem) and potential moderator (i.e., emotional intelligence) of the relationships between alienation from school and cyberbullying. Five hundred and seventy five Chinese middle school students participated in the study (45.74% male) and completed self-report questionnaires regarding alienation from school, cyberbullying, self-esteem, and emotional intelligence. Correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between alienation from school and cyberbullying. Mediation analysis indicated that alienation from school positively predicts individual cyberbullying, and self-esteem partly mediated the association. Meanwhile, emotional intelligence moderated the pathway from alienation from school to cyberbullying. Specifically, the effect of high alienation from school on cyberbullying was weaker for middle school students who reported high emotional intelligence. The findings of this study expose the influence of the school factor and individual factors on cyberbullying, which has potential preventive and intervention value for youth cyberbullying.", "Micro-expressions can reflect an individual's subjective emotions and true mental state and are widely used in the fields of mental health, justice, law enforcement, intelligence, and security. However, the current approach based on image and expert assessment-based micro-expression recognition technology has limitations such as limited application scenarios and time consumption. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, this study is the first to explore the brain mechanisms of micro-expressions and their differences from macro-expressions from a neuroscientific perspective. This can be a foundation for micro-expression recognition based on EEG signals. We designed a real-time supervision and emotional expression suppression (SEES) experimental paradigm to synchronously collect facial expressions and electroencephalograms. Electroencephalogram signals were analyzed at the scalp and source levels to determine the temporal and spatial neural patterns of micro- and macro-expressions. We found that micro-expressions were more strongly activated in the premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, and middle frontal gyrus in frontal regions under positive emotions than macro-expressions. Under negative emotions, micro-expressions were more weakly activated in the somatosensory cortex and corneal gyrus regions than macro-expressions. The activation of the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) was stronger in micro-expressions under positive than negative emotions. The reason for this difference is that the pathways of facial control are different; the production of micro-expressions under positive emotion is dependent on the control of the face, while micro-expressions under negative emotions are more dependent on the intensity of the emotion.", "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in American adults. If detected, DR can be treated to prevent further damage causing blindness. There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to help detect DR using electronic health records. The lesion-related information documented in fundus image reports is a valuable resource that could help diagnoses of DR in clinical decision support systems. However, most studies for AI-based DR diagnoses are mainly based on medical images; there is limited studies to explore the lesion-related information captured in the free text image reports.\nIn this study, we examined two state-of-the-art transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) models, including BERT and RoBERTa, compared them with a recurrent neural network implemented using Long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract DR-related concepts from clinical narratives. We identified four different categories of DR-related clinical concepts including lesions, eye parts, laterality, and severity, developed annotation guidelines, annotated a DR-corpus of 536 image reports, and developed transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and relation extraction. We also examined the relation extraction under two settings including 'gold-standard' setting-where gold-standard concepts were used-and end-to-end setting.\nFor concept extraction, the BERT model pretrained with the MIMIC III dataset achieve the best performance (0.9503 and 0.9645 for strict/lenient evaluation). For relation extraction, BERT model pretrained using general English text achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.9316. The end-to-end system, BERT_general_e2e, achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.8578 and 0.8881, respectively. Another end-to-end system based on the RoBERTa architecture, RoBERTa_general_e2e, also achieved the same performance as BERT_general_e2e in strict scores.\nThis study demonstrated the efficiency of transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and relation extraction. Our results show that it's necessary to pretrain transformer models using clinical text to optimize the performance for clinical concept extraction. Whereas, for relation extraction, transformers pretrained using general English text perform better.", "The aim of this study was to evaluate residents' real-time experiences and perceptions in using artificial intelligence-based decision support system (AI-DSS) applications in the clinical setting and provide recommendations on how to improve artificial intelligence (AI) curriculums in residency programs.\nWe implemented AI-DSS in our radiology workflow and integrated it into the radiology residency curriculum as a step in developing an AI-targeted curriculum. Fifteen senior residents were granted AI-DSS access for clinical use. Post-implementation, residents were anonymously surveyed to assess the utility of AI-DSS in addressing their learning needs and to determine the perceived impact of AI on their career choice and future professional development.\nMost residents (91.6%) support incorporating AI into the curriculum and found AI-DSS useful in supplementary roles of triaging (83.3%) and troubleshooting (66.7%), rather than for diagnostic purposes of speed (41.7%), accuracy (33.3%), or diagnosis determination (16.7%). Residents found it useful to have earlier exposure to AI (66.7%), although the exact timeline in training for when to introduce residents to AI-DSS was debated and unclear. Most residents (83.3%) had a positive outlook on the impact of AI on radiology and 50.0% were excited to further their understanding of AI.\nOur experience implementing AI-DSS in the clinical setting was a desirable and positive experience for our residents that will better prepare them as radiologists and help them capitalize on future opportunities in AI advancements. We hope our experience will provide incentive and guidance for other institutions to establish an AI program for their trainees.", "The drug-food interaction brings forth changes in the clinical effects of drugs. While favourable interactions bring positive clinical outcomes, unfavourable interactions may lead to toxicity. This article reviews the impact of food intake on drug-food interactions, the clinical effects of drugs, and the effect of drug-food in correlation with diet and precision medicine. Emerging areas in drug-food interactions are the food-genome interface (nutrigenomics) and nutrigenetics. Understanding the molecular basis of food ingredients, including genomic sequencing and pharmacological implications of food molecules, helps to reduce the impact of drug-food interactions. Various strategies are being leveraged to alleviate drug-food interactions; measures including patient engagement, digital health, approaches involving machine intelligence, and big data are a few of them. Furthermore, delineating the molecular communications across dietmicrobiome- drug-food-drug interactions in a pharmacomicrobiome framework may also play a vital role in personalized nutrition. Determining nutrient-gene interactions aids in making nutrition deeply personalized and helps mitigate unwanted drug-food interactions, chronic diseases, and adverse events from their onset. Translational bioinformatics approaches could play an essential role in the next generation of drug-food interaction research. In this landscape review, we discuss important tools, databases, and approaches along with key challenges and opportunities in drug-food interaction and its immediate impact on precision medicine.", "To explore and compare the cognitive processing weakness of children with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and comorbid reading disabilities (RD) (ADHD+RD) and children with ADHD only using the Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System (DN:CAS).\nEighty-eight children with ADHD who visited the hospital for the first time from September 2021 to November 2021 and had a Full scale intelligence quotient (IQ) of \u226585 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children revised in China (C-WISC) were selected (Age: 6-12 years; Grade: 2-6). Based on comorbidity with RD and the subtypes of ADHD (e.g., Inattention dominant type, ADHD-I, Hyperactivity/Impulse dominant type, ADHD-H and Combined type, ADHD-C), these children were divided into the ADHD+RD group (n = 30) and ADHD group (n = 58) as well as the corresponding subgroups. Clinical data on gender, age, grade, IQ scores, and DN:CAS processing scores were compared between both groups/subgroups. Spearman's correlation test was used for correlation analysis of results of interest.\nNo differences in age, grade, male-to-female ratio, verbal IQ, performance IQ, and full scale IQ were observed between the ADHD+RD group and ADHD group as well as the corresponding subgroups (P > 0.05). Children in the ADHD-C+RD subgroup had lower scores in Planning processing of DN:CAS than those in the ADHD-C subgroup (P = 0.040). However, there were no significant difference between the ADHD-I+RD subgroup and ADHD-I subgroup in Planning scores of DN:CAS assessment; The grade of ADHD-C+RD and ADHD-I+RD subgroups were positively correlated with the Planning scores of DN: CAS (r = 0.599, P = 0.030 and r = 0.508, P = 0.044, respectively). The grade of ADHD-C subgroup was positively correlated with the Planning and Simultaneous processing scores of DN: CAS (r = 0.409, P = 0.042 and r = 0.406, P = 0.044, respectively).\nOur study confirmed that children of ADHD-C with comorbid RD have a more severe Planning processing weakness compared to children with ADHD-C only. Among the children of ADHD-C+RD, ADHD-I+RD and ADHD-C, such a Planning processing impairment may improve with increasing educational skills.", "To investigate the utilization status and awareness of digital hospital construction among medical staff in critical care department of primary hospitals, so as to promote the process of digital medical health.\nOne to two doctors and nurses (in the department on that day) from public hospitals in 88 counties and urban areas in 9 cities of Guizhou Province were enrolled of field investigation. The questionnaires form were filled in on-site and sorted out and analyzed by special personnel.\nA total of 297 medical staff from the department of critical care medicine of 146 hospitals were included. All the questionnaires were filled in with their real names, including 152 doctors and 145 nurses. There were 24 class III Grade A hospitals and 122 class II and all the hospitals had implemented digital information management. The awareness of hospital digital information management system was generally low among the surveyed medical staff, and the awareness of hospital information system (HIS) was the highest (86.5%), followed by laboratory information management system (LIS, 41.4%) and image archiving and communication system (PACS, 40.7%). The awareness of hospital management system (HERP) was the lowest (7.7%). The total number of remote consultations conducted by hospitals using big data Internet was 25 428 times in 2020, with a median of 24.5 (88.0, 240.0) times in each hospital. From 2018 to 2020, the total number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital was 50 473, 57 565 and 57 907, respectively, of which the number of patients over 65 years old accounted for 37.47%, 41.26% and 43.31%, respectively (all P > 0.05). There were 4 242 cases of remote consultation using big data Internet in the department every year, with a median of 257.50 (96.50, 958.25) cases. 12.12% of the departments had independent critical monitoring systems, and 8.75% of them could capture data automatically to form tables. 96.30% of the medical staff participated in systematic and professional training on basic knowledge, basic theory and basic medical care skills through the Internet platform, and the number of meetings, studies and training in the provinces and prefectures were 282 and 357 times per year, respectively. More than 90% of the departments initiated remote consultation, arranged referral or admitted patients who had improved status after treatment in superior hospitals through the Internet platform. Most of the patients (69.02%) were from the lower level of the hospital. The total number of out-patient consultations was 2 959 times per year, with a median of 296 (185 473) times. 54.79% of the departments had fixed service villages, and 28.08% of the departments had fixed service population. The median furthest visit distance was 52.5 (30.0, 80.0) kilometers, and the median average visit distance was 30.0 (20.0, 50.0) kilometers. 54.88% of medical staff believed that the biggest difficulties encountered during house visits were insufficient energy and too large service groups or regions. More than 90% of medical staff had been exposed to cloud learning and cloud training, and most of the surveyed medical staff believed that cloud learning and cloud training greatly improved medical service capacity and service efficiency of medical institutions (71.04% and 67.01%, respectively). Meanwhile, they believe that \"Internet+health big data\" projects from various aspects brought advantage to medical institutions, but there are also low utilization rate of Internet medical equipment by village doctors, low acceptance for telemedicine and mobile hospitals by farmers.\nGuizhou public hospitals have implementation of digital information management at the grass-roots level, the surveyed health care workers have a relatively low awareness of the digital information management system, hospital use big data Internet for remote consultation is uneven, intensive care medicine is a clinical discipline used in most remote consultation information system, and can complete two-way referrals. In the past three years, the discipline operation showed an upward trend year by year. Medical staff use artificial intelligence devices such as cloud learning and training to improve medical service capacity and efficiency. The digital transformation of primary hospitals is being continuously improved.", "The development of clinical trials has led to substantial improvements in the prevention and treatment of many diseases, including brain cancer. Advances in medicine, such as improved surgical techniques, the development of new drugs and devices, the use of statistical methods in research, and the development of codes of ethics, have considerably influenced the way clinical trials are conducted today. In addition, methods from the broad field of artificial intelligence, such as radiomics, have the potential to considerably affect clinical trials and clinical practice in the future. Radiomics is a method to extract undiscovered features from routinely acquired imaging data that can neither be captured by means of human perception nor conventional image analysis. In patients with brain cancer, radiomics has shown its potential for the non-invasive identification of prognostic biomarkers, automated response assessment, and differentiation between treatment-related changes from tumour progression. Despite promising results, radiomics is not yet established in routine clinical practice nor in clinical trials. In this Viewpoint, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumour Group summarises the current status of radiomics, discusses its potential and limitations, envisions its future role in clinical trials in neuro-oncology, and provides guidance on how to address the challenges in radiomics.", "In plastic surgery and cosmetic dermatology, photographic data are an invaluable element of research and clinical practice. Additionally, the use of before and after images is a standard documentation method for procedures, and these images are particularly useful in consultations for effective communication with the patient. An artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach has been proven to have significant results in medical dermatology, plastic surgery, and antiaging procedures in recent years, with applications ranging from skin cancer screening to 3D face reconstructions, the prediction of biological age and perceived age. The increasing use of AI and computer vision methods is due to their noninvasive nature and their potential to provide remote diagnostics. This is especially helpful in instances where traveling to a physical office is complicated, as we have experienced in recent years with the global coronavirus pandemic. However, one question remains: how should the results of AI-based analysis be presented to enable personalization? In this paper, the author investigates the benefit of using gender- and age-specific scales to present skin parameter scores calculated using AI-based systems when analyzing image data.", "In this study, I introduce the use of Bayesian Artificial Intelligence, namely through the probabilistic and structure learning of Bayesian Network models, for hypothesis generation in psychiatry. Bayesian Networks are directed acyclic graphical models that allow researchers to account for complexity in multivariate data sets, as well as identify what is the likely causal direction in detected associations. This in turns leads to more effective designs for confirmatory studies in clinical settings, that go beyond association studies and can provide meaningful impact in clinical practice. As an example, I use three different data sets to highlight several frameworks for hypothesis generation. Bayesian Networks are useful models since the early stages of knowledge generation in psychiatry, and they can be easily adopted by most applied and clinical researchers for use in quantitative studies.", "This study aimed to construct artificial intelligence models based on thoracic CT images to perform segmentation and classification of benign pleural effusion (BPE) and malignant pleural effusion (MPE).\nA total of 918 patients with pleural effusion were initially included, with 607 randomly selected cases used as the training cohort and the other 311 as the internal testing cohort; another independent external testing cohort with 362 cases was used. We developed a pleural effusion segmentation model (M1) by combining 3D spatially weighted U-Net with 2D classical U-Net. Then, a classification model (M2) was built to identify BPE and MPE using a CT volume and its 3D pleural effusion mask as inputs.\nThe average Dice similarity coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, precision, sensitivity, Hausdorff distance 95% (HD95) and average surface distance indicators in M1 were 87.6\u00b15.0%, 82.2\u00b16.2%, 99.0\u00b11.0%, 83.0\u00b16.6%, 6.9\u00b13.8 and 1.6\u00b11.1, respectively, which were better than those of the 3D U-Net and 3D spatially weighted U-Net. Regarding M2, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity and specificity obtained with volume concat masks as input were 0.842 (95% CI 0.801 to 0.878), 89.4% (95% CI 84.4% to 93.2%) and 65.1% (95% CI 57.3% to 72.3%) in the external testing cohort. These performance metrics were significantly improved compared with those for the other input patterns.\nWe applied a deep learning model to the segmentation of pleural effusions, and the model showed encouraging performance in the differential diagnosis of BPE and MPE.", "Functional precision medicine is a new, emerging area that can guide cancer treatment by capturing information from direct perturbations of tumor-derived, living cells, such as by drug sensitivity screening. Precision cancer medicine as currently implemented in clinical practice has been driven by genomics, and current molecular tumor boards rely extensively on genomic characterization to advise on therapeutic interventions. However, genomic biomarkers can only guide treatment decisions for a fraction of the patients. In this review we provide an overview of the current state of functional precision medicine, highlight advances for drug-sensitivity screening enabled by cell culture models, and discuss how artificial intelligence (AI) can be coupled to functional precision medicine to guide patient stratification.", "An increasing number of patients suffering from diabetes require regular ophthalmological check-ups to diagnose and/or treat potential diabetic retinal disease. Some countries have already implemented systematic fundus assessments including artificial intelligence-based programs in order to detect sight-threatening retinopathy. The aim of this study was to improve the detection of diabetic fundus changes in Germany without examination by a\u00a0doctor and to create an easy access to ophthalmological examinations.\nIn this prospective monocentric study 93\u00a0patients in need for a\u00a0routine check-up for diabetic retinopathy were included. The study participants took up an offer of an examination (visual examination, non-mydriatic camera-based fundus examination) without doctor-patient contact. Patient satisfaction with the organization and examinations was assessed using a\u00a0questionnaire.\nThe mean age was 53.5\u00a0years (SD 13.6\u00a0years, 49.5% female) and 17\u00a0eyes (18.3%) showed a\u00a0diabetic retinopathy which was detected using a\u00a0camera-based examination. Within the small sample, no patient had to repeat the examination due to poor image quality. All categories of the questionnaire showed a\u00a0good to very good satisfaction, indicating a\u00a0high acceptance of the other examination form that took place at the ophthalmologist's premises.\nIn our study in an ophthalmological practice a\u00a0high level of acceptance among the patients interested in the screening for diabetic retinopathy without any direct patient-doctor contact was achieved. Our study shows a\u00a0very good acceptance and feasibility. Future use of artificial intelligence in clinical practice may help to be able to screen many more patients as in this study imaging quality was very good.\nHINTERGRUND: Eine regelm\u00e4\u00dfige ophthalmologische Untersuchung ist f\u00fcr immer mehr Menschen mit Diabetes gefordert, sei es zur Fr\u00fcherkennung und Kontrolle einer diabetischen Retinopathie. In manchen L\u00e4ndern kommen bereits automatische Verfahren der Bildauswertung zur Detektion einer behandlungsbed\u00fcrftigen diabetischen Retinopathie zur Anwendung. Ziel dieser Studie ist es, die Fr\u00fcherkennung diabetischer Augenerkrankungen ohne direkten Arzt-Patienten-Kontakt in Deutschland zu evaluieren und m\u00f6gliche Barrieren f\u00fcr Patienten zu erkennen.\nIn dieser prospektiven monozentrischen Studie wurden bisher 93\u00a0Patienten eingeschlossen, die sich f\u00fcr ein Screening auf eine diabetische Retinopathie vorstellten. Die Studienteilnehmer nahmen ein Angebot zu einer Untersuchung (Visuserhebung, non-mydriatische kamerabasierte Fundusuntersuchung) ohne Arzt-Patienten-Kontakt wahr. Mittels Fragebogen wurde die Zufriedenheit der Patienten erhoben.\nDas durchschnittliche Alter der eingeschlossenen Patienten (n\u202f=\u200993; 49,5\u202f% weiblich) betrug 53,5\u00a0Jahre (29 bis 76\u00a0Jahre, SD: 13,6\u00a0Jahre). Bei 17\u00a0Augen (18,3\u202f%) wurde mittels kamerabasierter Fundusuntersuchung eine diabetische Retinopathie festgestellt. In der Stichprobe musste sich kein Patient aufgrund schlechter Bildqualit\u00e4t erneut vorstellen. Insgesamt berichteten die Patienten eine hohe bis sehr hohe Zufriedenheit. Die Akzeptanz des Untersuchungsangebots war hoch.\nIn dieser Studie konnte mit einer Screeninguntersuchung ohne direkten Arztkontakt eine hohe Akzeptanz erreicht werden. Qualifiziertes Fachpersonal erm\u00f6glichte eine hohe Bildqualit\u00e4t der erhobenen Fundusbilder, sodass der Einsatz von automatischen Algorithmen (k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz) das Potenzial hat, die bisherigen Angebote zu erg\u00e4nzen.", "The impacts and threats posed by wildfires are dramatically increasing due to climate change. In recent years, the wildfire community has attempted to estimate wildfire occurrence with machine learning models. However, to fully exploit the potential of these models, it is of paramount importance to make their predictions interpretable and intelligible. This study is a first attempt to provide an eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for estimating wildfire occurrence using a Random Forest model with Shapley values for interpretation. Our findings accurately detected regions with a high presence of wildfires (area under the curve 81.3%) and outlined the drivers empowering occurrence, such as the Fire Weather Index and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Furthermore, our analysis suggests the presence of anomalous hotspots. In contexts where human and natural spheres constantly intermingle and interact, the XAI framework, suitably integrated into decision support systems, could support forest managers to prevent and mitigate future wildfire disasters and develop strategies for effective fire management, response, recovery, and resilience.", "Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by social communication difficulties, restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. The clinical pathway for children with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is varied, and current research suggests some children may not continue to meet diagnostic criteria over time.\nThe primary objective of this review was to synthesise the available evidence on the proportion of preschool children who have a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder at baseline (diagnosed before six years of age) who continue to meet diagnostic criteria at follow-up one or more years later (up to 19 years of age).\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and eight other databases in October 2017 and ran top-up searches up to July 2021. We also searched reference lists of relevant systematic reviews.\nTwo review authors independently assessed prospective and retrospective follow-up studies that used the same measure and process within studies to diagnose autism spectrum disorder at baseline and follow-up. Studies were required to have at least one year of follow-up and contain at least 10 participants. Participants were all aged less than six years at baseline assessment and followed up before 19 years of age.\nWe extracted data on study characteristics and the proportion of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at baseline and follow-up. We also collected information on change in scores on measures that assess the dimensions of autism spectrum disorder (i.e. social communication and restricted interests and repetitive behaviours). Two review authors independently extracted data on study characteristics and assessed risk of bias using a modified quality in prognosis studies (QUIPS) tool. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis or narrative synthesis, depending on the type of data available. We also conducted prognostic factor analyses to explore factors that may predict diagnostic outcome.\nIn total, 49 studies met our inclusion criteria and 42 of these (11,740 participants) had data that could be extracted. Of the 42 studies, 25 (60%) were conducted in North America, 13 (31%) were conducted in Europe and the UK, and four (10%) in Asia. Most (52%) studies were published before 2014. The mean age of the participants was 3.19 years (range 1.13 to 5.0 years) at baseline and 6.12 years (range 3.0 to 12.14 years) at follow-up. The mean length of follow-up was 2.86 years (range 1.0 to 12.41 years). The majority of the children were boys (81%), and just over half (60%) of the studies primarily included participants with intellectual disability (intelligence quotient < 70). The mean sample size was 272 (range 10 to 8564). Sixty-nine per cent of studies used one diagnostic assessment tool, 24% used two tools and 7% used three or more tools. Diagnosis was decided by a multidisciplinary team in 41% of studies. No data were available for the outcomes of social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviours and interests. Of the 42 studies with available data, we were able to synthesise data from 34 studies (69% of all included studies; n = 11,129) in a meta-analysis. In summary, 92% (95% confidence interval 89% to 95%) of participants continued to meet diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder from baseline to follow-up one or more years later; however, the quality of the evidence was judged as low due to study limitations and inconsistency. The majority of the included studies (95%) were rated at high risk of bias. We were unable to explore the outcomes of change in social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviour and interests between baseline and follow-up as none of the included studies provided separate domain scores at baseline and follow-up. Details on conflict of interest were reported in 24 studies. Funding support was reported by 30 studies, 12 studies omitted details on funding sources and two studies reported no funding support. Declared funding sources were categorised as government, university or non-government organisation or charity groups. We considered it unlikely funding sources would have significantly influenced the outcomes, given the nature of prognosis studies.\nOverall, we found that nine out of 10 children who were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder before six years of age continued to meet diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder a year or more later, however the evidence was uncertain. Confidence in the evidence was rated low using GRADE, due to heterogeneity and risk of bias, and there were few studies that included children diagnosed using a current classification system, such as the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or the eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Future studies that are well-designed, prospective and specifically assess prognosis of autism spectrum disorder diagnoses are needed. These studies should also include contemporary diagnostic assessment methods across a broad range of participants and investigate a range of relevant prognostic factors.", "The high prevalence and mortality of cardiovascular diseases in China's large population has increased the use of cardiovascular imaging for the assessment of conditions in recent years. In this study, we review the past 20 years of cardiovascular imaging in China, the increasingly important role played by cardiovascular computed tomography in coronary artery disease and pulmonary embolism assessment, magnetic resonance imaging's use for cardiomyopathy assessment, the development and application of artificial intelligence in cardiovascular imaging, and the future of Chinese cardiovascular imaging.", "In the context of music and speech perception, this study aimed to assess the effect of variation in one of two auditory attributes-pitch contour and timbre-on the perception of the other in prelingually deafened young cochlear implant (CI) users, and the relationship between pitch contour perception and two cognitive functions of interest.\nNine prelingually deafened CI users, aged 8.75-22.17 years, completed a melodic contour identification (MCI) task using stimuli of piano notes or sung speech with a fixed timbre (same word for each note) or a mixed timbre (different words for each note), a speech perception task identifying matrix-styled sentences naturally intonated or sung with a fixed pitch (same pitch for each word) or a mixed pitch (different pitches for each word), a forward digit span test indexing auditory short-term memory (STM), and the matrices section of the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test-Second Edition indexing nonverbal IQ.\nMCI was significantly poorer for the mixed timbre condition. Speech perception was significantly poorer for the fixed and mixed pitch conditions than for the naturally intonated condition. Auditory STM positively correlated with MCI at 2- and 3-semitone note spacings. Relative to their normal-hearing peers from a related study using the same stimuli and tasks, the CI participants showed comparable MCI at 2- or 3-semitone note spacing, and a comparable level of significant decrement in speech perception across three pitch contour conditions.\nFindings suggest that prelingually deafened CI users show similar trends of normal-hearing peers for the effect of variation in pitch contour or timbre on the perception of the other, and that cognitive functions may underlie these outcomes to some extent, at least for the perception of pitch contour.\nhttps://doi.org/10.23641/asha.21217937.", "In the last few years, breakthroughs in computational and experimental techniques have produced several key discoveries in the science of networks and human collective intelligence. This review presents the latest scientific findings from two key fields of research: collective problem-solving and the wisdom of the crowd. I demonstrate the core theoretical tensions separating these research traditions and show how recent findings offer a new synthesis for understanding how network dynamics alter collective intelligence, both positively and negatively. I conclude by highlighting current theoretical problems at the forefront of research on networked collective intelligence, as well as vital public policy challenges that require new research efforts.", "The distinction of papilledema from other optic nerve head (ONH) lesions mimicking papilledema, such as optic disc drusen (ODD), can be difficult in clinical practice. We aimed the following: (1) to develop a deep learning algorithm to automatically identify major structures of the ONH in 3-dimensional (3D) optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and (2) to exploit such information to robustly differentiate among ODD, papilledema, and healthy ONHs.\nThis was a cross-sectional comparative study of patients from 3 sites (Singapore, Denmark, and Australia) with confirmed ODD, those with papilledema due to raised intracranial pressure, and healthy controls. Raster scans of the ONH were acquired using OCT imaging and then processed to improve deep-tissue visibility. First, a deep learning algorithm was developed to identify major ONH tissues and ODD regions. The performance of our algorithm was assessed using the Dice coefficient. Second, a classification algorithm (random forest) was designed to perform 3-class classifications (1: ODD, 2: papilledema, and 3: healthy ONHs) strictly from their drusen and prelamina swelling scores (calculated from the segmentations). To assess performance, we reported the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for each class.\nA total of 241 patients (256 imaged ONHs, including 105 ODD, 51 papilledema, and 100 healthy ONHs) were retrospectively included in this study. Using OCT images of the ONH, our segmentation algorithm was able to isolate neural and connective tissues and ODD regions/conglomerates whenever present. This was confirmed by an averaged Dice coefficient of 0.93 \u00b1 0.03 on the test set, corresponding to good segmentation performance. Classification was achieved with high AUCs, that is, 0.99 \u00b1 0.001 for the detection of ODD, 0.99 \u00b1 0.005 for the detection of papilledema, and 0.98 \u00b1 0.01 for the detection of healthy ONHs.\nOur artificial intelligence approach can discriminate ODD from papilledema, strictly using a single OCT scan of the ONH. Our classification performance was very good in the studied population, with the caveat that validation in a much larger population is warranted. Our approach may have the potential to establish OCT imaging as one of the mainstays of diagnostic imaging for ONH disorders in neuro-ophthalmology, in addition to fundus photography.", "Volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) is an advanced endoscopic imaging tool that can improve dysplasia detection in Barrett's esophagus (BE). However, VLE scans generate 1200 cross-sectional images that can make interpretation difficult. The impact of a new VLE artificial intelligence algorithm called Intelligent Real-time Image Segmentation (IRIS) is not well-characterized. This is a randomized prospective cross-over study of BE patients undergoing endoscopy who were randomized to IRIS-enhanced or unenhanced VLE first followed by the other (IRIS-VLE vs. VLE-IRIS, respectively) at expert BE centers. The primary outcome was image interpretation time, which served as a surrogate measure for ease of interpretation. The secondary outcome was diagnostic yield of dysplasia for each imaging modality. 133 patients were enrolled. 67 patients were randomized to VLE-IRIS and 66 to IRIS-VLE. Total interpretation time did not differ significantly between groups (7.8\u00a0min VLE-IRIS vs. 7\u00a0min IRIS-VLE, P\u2009=\u20090.1), however unenhanced VLE interpretation time was significantly shorter in the IRIS-VLE group (2.4\u00a0min vs. 3.8\u00a0min, P\u2009<\u20090.01). When IRIS was used first, 100% of dysplastic areas were identified, compared with 76.9% when VLE was the first interpretation modality (P\u2009=\u20090.06). IRIS-enhanced VLE reduced the time of subsequent unenhanced VLE interpretation, suggesting heightened efficiency and improved dysplasia detection. It was also able to identify all endoscopically non-visible dysplastic areas.", "Recently, interest and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including deep learning for medical images have surged. As imaging plays a major role in the assessment of pulmonary diseases, various AI algorithms have been developed for chest imaging. Some of these have been approved by governments and are now commercially available in the marketplace. In the field of chest radiology, there are various tasks and purposes that are suitable for AI: initial evaluation/triage of certain diseases, detection and diagnosis, quantitative assessment of disease severity and monitoring, and prediction for decision support. While AI is a powerful technology that can be applied to medical imaging and is expected to improve our current clinical practice, some obstacles must be addressed for the successful implementation of AI in workflows. Understanding and becoming familiar with the current status and potential clinical applications of AI in chest imaging, as well as remaining challenges, would be essential for radiologists and clinicians in the era of AI. This review introduces the potential clinical applications of AI in chest imaging and also discusses the challenges for the implementation of AI in daily clinical practice and future directions in chest imaging.", "By introducing a novel risk to human interaction, COVID-19 may have galvanized interest in uses of artificial intelligence (AI). But was the pandemic a large enough catalyst to change public attitudes about the costs and benefits of autonomous systems whose operations increasingly rely on AI? To answer this question, we use a preregistered research design that exploits variation across the 2018 and 2020 waves of the CCES/CES, a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States. We compare support for autonomous cars, autonomous surgeries, weapons, and cyber defense pre- and post-the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that, despite the incentives created by COVID-19, the pandemic did not increase support for most of these technologies, except in the case of autonomous surgery among those who know someone who died of COVID-19. The results hold even when controlling for a variety of relevant political and demographic factors. The pandemic did little to push potential autonomous vehicle users to support adoption. Further, American concerns about autonomous weapons, including cyber defense, remain sticky and perhaps exacerbated over the last two years. These findings suggest that the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the adoption of many of these systems is far more nuanced and complex than headlines may suggest.", "This study examined the relationship between physical exercise (PE) and prosocial behavior (PSB) and constructed a chain mediation model through the mediating effect of physical education learning motivation (PELM) and emotional intelligence (EI).\nThrough the stratified random sampling, 1053 students (average age = 14 years, SD = 0.96 years) that complied with the requirements were surveyed from Henan Province in China. PE, EI, PELM, and PSB were assessed using standard scales. For data analysis, Pearson's correlation analysis, structural equation model test, and bias-corrected percentile Bootstrap method were carried out in turn.\n(1) There was a significant positive correlation between PE and PSB (r = 0.137), and the direct path between PE and PSB was significant (\u03b2 = 0.09, t = 4.73, p < 0.01); (2) PE can positively predict EI (\u03b2= 0.08, t = 5.27, p < 0.01) and PELM (\u03b2= 0.04, t = 2.07, p < 0.05), EI can significantly and positively PSB (\u03b2= 0.67, t = 22.12, p < 0.01), PELM can significantly and positively predict PSB (\u03b2= 0.05, t =2.20, p<0.05); (3) EI and physical learning motivation play a significant intermediary role between PE and PSB. The mediating effect consists of three indirect effects: PE \u2192 EI \u2192 PSB (the mediating effect value is 0.055), PE \u2192 PELM \u2192 PSB (the mediating effect value is 0.002), PE \u2192 EI \u2192 PELM \u2192 PSB (the mediating effect value is 0.002); (4) The chain mediation effect is significant in girls, but not in boys.\n(1) PE can positively predict PSB. (2) EI and PELM had significant mediating effects between PE and PSB, including single mediating effects of EI and PELM and chain mediating effects of EI-PELM; (3) There are gender differences in the chain mediation effect.", "Predicting the presence or absence of coronary artery disease (CAD) is clinically important. Pretest probability (PTP) and CAD consortium clinical (CAD2) model and risk scores used in the guidelines are not sufficiently accurate as the only guidance for applying invasive testing or discharging a patient. Artificial intelligence without the need of additional non-invasive testing is not yet used in this context, as previous results of the model are promising, but available in high-risk population only. Still, validation in low-risk patients, which is clinically most relevant, is lacking.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nSecondary outpatient clinic care in one Dutch academic hospital.\nWe included 696 patients referred from primary care for further testing regarding the presence or absence of CAD. The results were compared with PTP and CAD2 using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (area under the curve (AUC)). CAD was defined by a coronary stenosis >50% in at least one coronary vessel in invasive coronary or CT angiography, or having a coronary event within 6 months.\nThe first cohort validating the memetic pattern-based algorithm (MPA) model developed in two high-risk populations in a low-risk to intermediate-risk cohort to improve risk stratification for non-invasive diagnosis of the presence or absence of CAD.\nThe population contained 49% male, average age was 65.6\u00b112.6 years. 16.2% had CAD. The AUCs of the MPA model, the PTP and the CAD2 were 0.87, 0.80, and 0.82, respectively. Applying the MPA model resulted in possible discharge of 67.7% of the patients with an acceptable CAD rate of 4.2%.\nIn this low-risk to intermediate-risk population, the MPA model provides a good risk stratification of presence or absence of CAD with a better ROC compared with traditional risk scores. The results are promising but need prospective confirmation.", "Terminal microdeletion of chromosome 6q is a rare syndrome that can result in a spectrum of phenotypes varying from normal intelligence-minimal clinical symptoms to severe neurological defects and developmental delays. The most frequent clinical characteristics include developmental delays prior to and following birth as well as intellectual disability, brain malformations, and facial dysmorphism. These clinical characteristics may not be correlated with the size of the deletion; as many cases have been identified with either minor or major deletions, the genotype-phenotype correlation should be better investigated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 6q26-q27 chromosome microdeletion in Turkey. In this article, we determine the clinical and genomic characteristics of a 2-year-old female case of 6q26-q27 chromosome microdeletion by investigating the level of development of the patient, brain malformations and dysmorphic characteristics, and ultimately comparing them to other cases reported in literature. Our patient was diagnosed with severe Global Developmental Delays (GDD). Although our case had similar clinical characteristics to corresponding cases in literature, there is a difference in the variety and group of symptoms exhibited.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support diagnostic workflows in oncology by aiding diagnosis and providing biomarkers directly from routine pathology slides. However, AI applications are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Hence, it is essential to quantify and mitigate this risk before widespread clinical use. Here, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are highly susceptible to white- and black-box adversarial attacks in clinically relevant weakly-supervised classification tasks. Adversarially robust training and dual batch normalization (DBN) are possible mitigation strategies but require precise knowledge of the type of attack used in the inference. We demonstrate that vision transformers (ViTs) perform equally well compared to CNNs at baseline, but are orders of magnitude more robust to white- and black-box attacks. At a mechanistic level, we show that this is associated with a more robust latent representation of clinically relevant categories in ViTs compared to CNNs. Our results are in line with previous theoretical studies and provide empirical evidence that ViTs are robust learners in computational pathology. This implies that large-scale rollout of AI models in computational pathology should rely on ViTs rather than CNN-based classifiers to provide inherent protection against perturbation of the input data, especially adversarial attacks.", "Unsupervised machine learning techniques have become increasingly popular for studying associations between gestational exposure mixtures and human health. Latent profile analysis is one method that has not been fully explored.\nWe estimated associations between gestational chemical mixtures and child neurodevelopment using latent profile analysis. Using data from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) research platform, a longitudinal cohort of pregnant Canadian women and their children, we generated latent profiles from 27 gestational exposure biomarkers. We then examined the associations between these profiles and child Verbal IQ, Performance IQ, and Full-Scale IQ, measured with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Third Edition (WPPSI-III). We validated our findings using k-means clustering.\nLatent profile analysis detected five latent profiles of exposure: a reference profile containing 61% of the study participants, a high monoethyl phthalate (MEP) profile with moderately low persistent organic pollutants (POPs) containing 26%, a high POP profile containing 6%, a low POP profile containing 4%, and a smoking chemicals profile containing 3%. We observed negative associations between both the smoking chemicals and high MEP profiles and all IQ scores and between the high POP profile and Full-Scale and Verbal IQ scores. We also found a positive association between the low POP profile and Full-Scale and Performance IQ scores. All associations had wide 95% confidence intervals.\nLatent profile analysis is a promising technique for identifying patterns of chemical exposure and is worthy of further study for its use in examining complicated exposure mixtures.", "To examine the association of body mass index (BMI) [kg/m2] and its classifications (underweight [BMI < 18.5], normal [18.5 \u2264 BMI < 25], overweight [25 \u2264 BMI < 30], and obese [BMI \u2265 30]) with brain structure in individuals with a wide range of BMI group.\nThe participants included 382 right-handed individuals (mean age: 46.9 \u00b1 14.3 years, 142 men and 240 women). The intelligence quotient was assessed using the Japanese Adult Reading Test. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed to analyze the association of BMI and its classifications with gray and white matter structures, respectively.\nAccording to VBM, BMI was significantly and negatively correlated with the bilateral cerebellum exterior volumes. In group comparisons, the right cerebellum exterior volume was significantly lower in the overweight or obese group than in the underweight or normal group, while the bilateral cuneus and calcarine cortex, left cuneus, and left precuneus volume was significantly lower in the underweight group than in the non-underweight group. Sex-related stratification analyses for VBM revealed that BMI was significantly and negatively correlated with the bilateral cerebellum exterior volumes only in women. In group comparisons, the left cerebellum exterior volume was significantly lower in obese women than in non-obese women. The left thalamus proper and the right cerebellum exterior volumes were significantly lower in overweight or obese group than in underweight or normal group in men and women, respectively. The bilateral cuneus and calcarine cortex, left cuneus and carcarine cortex, and bilateral cuneus volume was significantly lower in underweight men than in non-underweight men. In contrast, there were no notable findings on DTI.\nOur results suggest association of continuous BMI, being overweight or obese, and being underweight with decreased gray matter volume in individuals with a wide range of BMI group. Furthermore, sex-related differences are seen in the association of BMI and its classifications with regional gray matter volume reductions. Abnormally high or low BMIs may have a negative influence on regional gray matter volumes.", "Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been a major challenge for medical and healthcare sectors in many underdeveloped countries with limited diagnosis tools. Tuberculosis can be detected from microscopic slides and chest X-ray but as a result of the high cases of tuberculosis, this method can be tedious for both microbiologist and Radiologist and can lead to miss-diagnosis. The main objective of this study is to addressed these challenges by employing Computer Aided Detection (CAD) using Artificial Intelligence-driven models which learn features based on convolution and result in an output with high accuracy. In this paper, we described automated discrimination of X-ray and microscopic slide images of tuberculosis into positive and negative cases using pretrained AlexNet Models. The study employed Chest X-ray dataset made available on Kaggle repository and microscopic slide images from both Near East university hospital and Kaggle repository. For classification of tuberculosis and healthy microscopic slide using AlexNet+Softmax, the model achieved accuracy of 98.14%. For classification of tuberculosis and healthy microscopic slide using AlexNet+SVM, the model achieved 98.73% accuracy. For classification of tuberculosis and healthy chest X-ray images using AlexNet+Softmax, the model achieved accuracy of 98.19%. For classification of tuberculosis and healthy chest X-ray images using AlexNet+SVM, the model achieved 98.38% accuracy. The result obtained has shown to outperformed several studies in the current literature. Future studies will attempt to integrate Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for the design of IoMT/AI-enabled platform for detection of Tuberculosis from both X-ray and Microscopic slide images.", "The relation among the various causal factors of obesity is not well understood, and there remains a lack of viable data to advance integrated, systems models of its etiology. The collection of big data has begun to allow the exploration of causal associations between behavior, built environment, and obesity-relevant health outcomes. Here, the traditional epidemiologic and emerging big data approaches used in obesity research are compared, describing the research questions, needs, and outcomes of 3 broad research domains: eating behavior, social food environments, and the built environment. Taking tangible steps at the intersection of these domains, the recent European Union project \"BigO: Big data against childhood obesity\" used a mobile health tool to link objective measurements of health, physical activity, and the built environment. BigO provided learning on the limitations of big data, such as privacy concerns, study sampling, and the balancing of epidemiologic domain expertise with the required technical expertise. Adopting big data approaches will facilitate the exploitation of data concerning obesity-relevant behaviors of a greater variety, which are also processed at speed, facilitated by mobile-based data collection and monitoring systems, citizen science, and artificial intelligence. These approaches will allow the field to expand from causal inference to more complex, systems-level predictive models, stimulating ambitious and effective policy interventions.", "Advances in science and technology promote the rapid development of toxicological detection technologies. However, there is still a lack of decision-making tools for toxicological risk assessment, such as the lack of transparent schemes to evaluate current toxicological research and practice and the lag of toxicological testing tools to evaluate toxicity, resulting in difficulties in toxicity verification and hindering the transformation of toxicological research paradigm. Some scholars have proposed to integrate the concept of evidence-based medicine with the toxicological practice to improve the technical methods of toxicological research concept and risk assessment decision-making. With the promotion of relevant scholars and academic organizations, the concept and connotation of evidence-based toxicology have gradually become clear and a framework for research and practice has been initially formed. Although there are still many challenges, it also provides a new idea for the toxicity risk assessment and safe medication decision-making of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM). The era of digital intelligence has brought new opportunities and broad space for the development of TCM evidence-based toxicology. The exploration of TCM evidence-based toxicology from concept to method is an important embodiment of the development of TCM evidence-based toxicology, and will also promote the continuous enrichment and improvement of the research and practice system of TCM evidence-based toxicology.", "With the development trend of artificial intelligence technology and the popularization of wearable sensors, human activity recognition based on sensor data information has received widespread attention and has great application value. In order to better optimize the network structure and reduce the total number of main training parameters in the convolutional layer, a convolutional network entity model based on shared resources of main parameters is clearly proposed. We analyzed the CNN multi-position wearable sensor human activity recognition used in basketball training. According to the entity model of the main parameters of shared resources, the effectiveness of the entity model is verified from both the total number of sensors and the accuracy of single-class recognition. In addition to maintaining the actual effect of recognition, the main training parameters are also reduced. The simulation results verify the actual effect of the SVM algorithm and motion simulation of the convolutional network entity model. On this basis, scientific research physical exercise methods are selected to reasonably ensure the smooth progress of appropriate physical exercise at a certain level, improve the quality of training and the actual effect.", "To evaluate the value of artificial intelligence (AI) for recommendation of pupil dilation test using medical interview and basic ophthalmologic examinations.\nRetrospective, cross-sectional study.\nMedical records of 56,811 patients who visited our outpatient clinic for the first time between 2017 and 2020 were included in the training dataset. Patients who visited the clinic in 2021 were included in the test dataset. Among these, 3,885 asymptomatic patients, including eye check-up patients, were initially included in test dataset I. Subsequently, 14,199 symptomatic patients who visited the clinic in 2021 were included in test dataset II.\nAll patients underwent a medical interview and basic ophthalmologic examinations such as uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, non-contact tonometry, auto-keratometry, slit-lamp examination, dilated pupil test, and fundus examination. A clinically significant lesion in the lens, vitreous, and fundus was defined by subspecialists, and the need for a pupil dilation test was determined when the participants had one or more clinically significant lesions in any eye. Input variables of AI consisted of a medical interview and basic ophthalmologic examinations, and the AI was evaluated with predictive performance for the need of a pupil dilation test.\nAccuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value.\nClinically significant lesions were present in 26.5 and 59.1% of patients in test datasets I and II, respectively. In test dataset I, the model performances were as follows: accuracy, 0.908 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.880-0.936); sensitivity, 0.757 (95% CI: 0.713-0.801); specificity, 0.962 (95% CI: 0.947-0.977); positive predictive value, 0.878 (95% CI: 0.834-0.922); and F1 score, 0.813. In test dataset II, the model had an accuracy of 0.949 (95% CI: 0.934-0.964), a sensitivity of 0.942 (95% CI: 0.928-956), a specificity of 0.960 (95% CI: 0.927-0.993), a positive predictive value of 0.971 (95% CI: 0.957-0.985), and a F1 score of 0.956.\nThe AI model performing a medical interview and basic ophthalmologic examinations to determine the need for a pupil dilation test had good sensitivity and specificity for symptomatic patients, although there was a limitation in identifying asymptomatic patients.", "Specific pathways of intergenerational transmission of behavioral traits remain unclear. Here, we aim to investigate how parental genetics influence offspring cognition, educational attainment, and psychopathology in youth.\nParticipants for the discovery sample were 2,189 offspring (aged 6-14\u2009years), 1898 mothers and 1,017 fathers who underwent genotyping, psychiatric, and cognitive assessments. We calculated polygenic scores (PGS) for cognition, educational attainment, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia for the trios. Phenotypes studied included educational and cognitive measures, ADHD and psychotic symptoms. We used a stepwise approach and multiple mediation models to analyze the effect of parental PGS on offspring traits via offspring PGS and parental phenotype. Significant results were replicated in a sample of 1,029 adolescents, 363 mothers, and 307 fathers.\nMaternal and paternal PGS for cognition influenced offspring general intelligence and executive function via offspring PGS (genetic pathway) and parental education (phenotypic pathway). Similar results were found for parental PGS for educational attainment and offspring reading and writing skills. These pathways fully explained associations between parental PGS and offspring phenotypes, without residual direct association. Associations with maternal, but not paternal, PGS were replicated. No associations were found between parental PGS for psychopathology and offspring specific symptoms.\nOur findings indicate that parental genetics influences offspring cognition and educational attainment by genetic and phenotypic pathways, suggesting the expression of parental phenotypes partially explain the association between parental genetic risk and offspring outcomes. Multiple mediations might represent an effective approach to disentangle distinct pathways for intergenerational transmission of behavioral traits.", "Empathy is the ability to adopt another person's perspective and experience the thoughts and emotions of that individual. A growing number of studies have shown that school-age children's empathy robustly contributes to their interpersonal communication, academic achievement and psychosocial adjustment. For school-age children, school becomes the main place for learning and socializing. The student-teacher relationship is an important interpersonal relationship between children and adults after they leave home, which plays an important role in the development of children's self-ability. However, the relationship between student-teacher relationship and children's empathy and its mechanisms are unclear. This study aimed to explore the influence of student-teacher relationship on school-age children's empathy, and the mediating roles of emotional intelligence.\n468 school-age children (250 boys and 238 girls) aged 8-11 (M age = 9.22, SD age = 1.20) from Guizhou Province completed questionnaires about student-teacher relationship, emotional intelligence, and children's empathy.\nThe results showed that student-teacher relationship positively and directly predicted empathy for girls, but not for boys. In addition, we also found that emotional intelligence mediated the relationship between student-teacher relationship and children's empathy among both boys and girls.\nThis study reveals the effect of student-teacher relationship on the school-age children's empathy, and the unique mediating role of emotional intelligence. Moreover, this study further reveals the different effects of student-teacher relationship on boys' and girls' empathy, emphasizing that positive student-teacher relationship can directly promote the development of girls' empathy. Finally, this study emphasizes that cultivating and improving the emotional intelligence of school-age children may be an effective way to promote the development of children's empathy.", "The sustainable use of resources is essential in all production areas, including pharmaceuticals. However, the aspect of sustainability needs to be taken into consideration not only in the production phase, but during the whole medicinal chemistry drug discovery trajectory. The continuous progress in the fields of green chemistry and the use of artificial intelligence are contributing to the speed and effectiveness of a more sustainable drug discovery pipeline. In this light, here we review the most recent sustainable and green synthetic approaches used for the preparation and derivatization of chalcones, an important class of privileged structures and building blocks used for the preparation of new biologically active compounds with a broad spectrum of potential therapeutic applications. The literature here reported has been retrieved from the SciFinder database using the term \"chalcone\" as a keyword and filtering the results applying the concept: \"green chemistry\", and from the Reaxys database using the keywords \"chalcone\" and \"green\". For both databases the time-frame was 2017-2022. References were manually selected based on relevance.", "Suicide messages can be transmitted infinitely online; the Internet is influential in suicide prevention. Identifying suicide risks online via artificial technological advances may help predict suicide.\nWe built a classifier that detects open messages containing suicidal ideation or behavior-related words in social media via text mining methods and developed the Monitoring-Tracking-Rescuing model, which links data monitoring and tracking to high-risk suicide rescues. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers were applied to online posts of common social media sites in Taiwan. This model uses a two-step high-risk identification procedure: an automatic prediction process using NLP to classify suicide-risk levels, followed by professional validation by a senior psychiatrist and a nursing faculty specialized in suicidology.\nFrom a dataset containing 404 high-risk and 2226 no- or low-risk articles, the sensitivity and specificity of our model reached 80\u00a0%.\nThe model is limited to data platforms that can be \"crawled\" and excludes suicide-risk content from graphics, video and audio files. Additionally, machine learning does not provide the best recognition rate from complex online messages. Keywords for high-risk suicide in long articles are difficult to interpret using this model. Finally, the model lacks keywords for suicide-protective factors.\nArtificial intelligence techniques may help detect and monitor high-risk suicide posts and inform mental health professionals of these posts. Periodic tracking plus manual validation to determine risk levels are recommended to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of Internet suicide-prevention tasks.", "Twitter is a popular social networking site where short messages or \"tweets\" of users have been used extensively for research purposes. However, not much research has been done in mining the medical professions, such as detecting the occupations of users from their biographical contents. Mining such professions can be used to build efficient recommender systems for cost-effective targeted advertisements. Moreover, it is highly important to develop effective methods to identify the occupation of users since conventional classification methods rely on features developed by human intelligence. Although, the result may be favorable for the classification problem. However, it is still extremely challenging for traditional classifiers to predict the medical occupations accurately since it involves predicting multiple occupations. Hence this study emphasizes predicting the medical occupational class of users through their public biographical (\"Bio\") content. We have conducted our analysis by annotating the bio content of Twitter users. In this paper, we propose a method of combining word embedding with state-of-art neural network models that include: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, and A lite BERT. Moreover, we have also observed that by composing the word embedding with the neural network models there is no need to construct any particular attribute or feature. By using word embedding, the bio contents are formatted as dense vectors which are fed as input into the neural network models as a sequence of vectors.\nPerformance metrics that include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score have shown a significant difference between our method of combining word embedding with neural network models than with the traditional methods. The scores have proved that our proposed approach has outperformed the traditional machine learning techniques for detecting medical occupations among users. ALBERT has performed the best among the deep learning networks with an F1 score of 0.90.\nIn this study, we have presented a novel method of detecting the occupations of Twitter users engaged in the medical domain by merging word embedding with state-of-art neural networks. The outcomes of our approach have demonstrated that our method can further advance the process of analyzing corpora of social media without going through the trouble of developing computationally expensive features.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have become increasingly relevant across a broad spectrum of settings in medical imaging. Due to the large amount of imaging data that is generated in oncological hybrid imaging, AI applications are desirable for lesion detection and characterization in primary staging, therapy monitoring, and recurrence detection.

Radiomics data are obtained through artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks that analyze imaging, usually MRI, to assess statistical, geometrical, and textural features of images to provide quantitative data of shape, heterogeneity, and intensity of tumors. Genomics involves assessing the genomic markers that are present from tumor biopsies. In this article, we separately investigate the current landscape of radiomics and genomics within the realm of PCa and discuss the integration and validity of both into radiogenomics using the data from three papers on the topic. We also conducted a clinical trials search using the NIH's database, where we found two relevant actively recruiting studies. Although there is more research needed to be done on radiogenomics to fully adopt it as a viable diagnosis tool, its potential by providing personalized data regarding each tumor cannot be overlooked as it may be the future of PCa risk-stratification techniques.", "Chinese medicine (CM) has thousands of years of experience in prevention of diseases. As for CM, people's constitution is closely related to their health status, thus recognition of CM constitution is the fundamental and core content of research on constitution types. With development of technologies such as sensors, artificial intelligence and big data, objectification of the four diagnostic methods of CM has gradually matured, bringing changes in the mindset and innovations in technical means for recognition of CM constitution. This paper presents a systematic review of the latest research trends in constitution recognition based on objectification of diagnostic methods in CM.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a fundamental component of global agricultural research that is poised to impact on many aspects of plant science. In digital phenomics, AI is capable of learning intricate structure and patterns in large datasets. We provide a perspective and primer on AI applications to phenome research. We propose a novel human-centric explainable AI (X-AI) system architecture consisting of data architecture, technology infrastructure, and AI architecture design. We clarify the difference between post hoc models and 'interpretable by design' models. We include guidance for effectively using an interpretable by design model in phenomic analysis. We also provide directions to sources of tools and resources for making data analytics increasingly accessible. This primer is accompanied by an interactive online tutorial.", "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by numerous genetic and environmental factors leading to musculoskeletal system pain. RA may damage other tissues and organs, causing complications that severely reduce patients' quality of life. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 1.71 billion individuals worldwide had musculoskeletal problems in 2021. Rheumatologists face challenges in the early detection of RA since its symptoms are similar to other illnesses, and there is no definitive test to diagnose the disease. Accordingly, it is preferable to profit from the power of computational intelligence techniques that can identify hidden patterns to diagnose RA early. Although multiple studies were conducted to diagnose RA early, they showed unsatisfactory performance, with the highest accuracy of 87.5% using imaging data. Yet, imaging data requires diagnostic tools that are challenging to collect and examine and are more costly. Recent studies indicated that neither a blood test nor a physical finding could early confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, this study proposes a novel ensemble technique for the preemptive prediction of RA and investigates the possibility of diagnosing the disease using clinical data before the symptoms appear. Two datasets were obtained from King Fahad University Hospital (KFUH), Dammam, Saudi Arabia, including 446 patients, with 251 positive cases of RA and 195 negative cases of RA. Two experiments were conducted where the former was developed without upsampling the dataset, and the latter was carried out using an upsampled dataset. Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms were utilized to assemble the novel voting ensemble, including support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and adaptive boosting (Adaboost). The results indicated that clinical laboratory tests fed to the proposed voting ensemble technique could accurately diagnose RA preemptively with an accuracy, recall, and precision of 94.03%, 96.00%, and 93.51%, respectively, with 30 clinical features when utilizing the original data and sequential forward feature selection (SFFS) technique. It is concluded that deploying the proposed model in local hospitals can contribute to introducing a method that aids medical specialists in preemptively diagnosing RA and stopping or delaying the course using clinical laboratory tests.", "Enzyme parameters are essential for quantitatively understanding, modelling, and engineering cells. However, experimental measurements cover only a small fraction of known enzyme-compound pairs in model organisms, much less in other organisms. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have accelerated the pace of exploring enzyme properties by predicting these in a high-throughput manner. Here, we present GotEnzymes, an extensive database with enzyme parameter predictions by AI approaches, which is publicly available at https://metabolicatlas.org/gotenzymes for interactive web exploration and programmatic access. The first release of this data resource contains predicted turnover numbers of over 25.7 million enzyme-compound pairs across 8099 organisms. We believe that GotEnzymes, with the readily-predicted enzyme parameters, would bring a speed boost to biological research covering both experimental and computational fields that involve working with candidate enzymes.", "When a drug is administered to exert its efficacy, it will encounter multiple barriers and go through multiple interactions. Predicting the drug-related multiple interactions is critical for drug development and safety monitoring because it provides foundations for practical, safe compatibility and rational use of multiple drugs. With the progress of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, a variety of novel prediction methods for single interaction have emerged and shown great advantages compared to the traditional, expensive and time-consuming laboratory research. To promote the comprehensive and simultaneous predictions of multiple interactions, we systematically reviewed the application of AI in drug-drug, drug-food (excipients) and drug-microbiome interactions. We began by outlining the model methods, evaluation indicators, algorithms and databases commonly used to build models for three types of drug interactions. The models based on the metabolic enzyme P450, drug similarity and drug targets have empathized among the machine learning models of drug-drug interactions. In particular, we discussed the limitations of current approaches and identified potential areas for future research. It is anticipated the in-depth review will be helpful for the development of the next-generation of systematic prediction models for simultaneous multiple interactions.", "Optical spectroscopy plays an important role in disease detection. Improving the sensitivity and specificity of spectral detection has great importance in the development of accurate diagnosis. The development of artificial intelligence technology provides a great opportunity to improve the detection accuracy through machine learning methods. In this Perspective, we focus on the combination of machine learning methods with the optical spectroscopy methods widely used for disease detection, including absorbance, fluorescence, scattering, FTIR, terahertz, etc. By comparing the spectral analysis with different machine learning methods, we illustrate that the support vector machine and convolutional neural network are most effective, which have potential to further improve the classification accuracy to distinguish disease subtypes if these machine learning methods are used. This Perspective broadens the scope of optical spectroscopy enhanced by machine learning and will be useful for the development of disease detection.", "COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the weaknesses of most health systems around the world, collapsing them and depleting their available health care resources. Fortunately, the development and enforcement of specific public health policies, such as vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing, among others, has reduced the prevalence and complications associated with COVID-19 in its acute phase. However, the aftermath of the global pandemic has called for an efficient approach to manage patients with long COVID-19. This is a great opportunity to leverage on innovative digital health solutions to provide exhausted health care systems with the most cost-effective and efficient tools available to support the clinical management of this population. In this context, the SENSING-AI project is focused on the research toward the implementation of an artificial intelligence-driven digital health solution that supports both the adaptive self-management of people living with long COVID-19 and the health care staff in charge of the management and follow-up of this population.\nThe objective of this protocol is the prospective collection of psychometric and biometric data from 10 patients for training algorithms and prediction models to complement the SENSING-AI cohort.\nPublicly available health and lifestyle data registries will be consulted and complemented with a retrospective cohort of anonymized data collected from clinical information of patients diagnosed with long COVID-19. Furthermore, a prospective patient-generated data set will be captured using wearable devices and validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaires to complement the retrospective cohort. Finally, the 'Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse' guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship will be applied to the resulting data set to encourage the continuous process of discovery, evaluation, and reuse of information for the research community at large.\nThe SENSING-AI cohort is expected to be completed during 2022. It is expected that sufficient data will be obtained to generate artificial intelligence models based on behavior change and mental well-being techniques to improve patients' self-management, while providing useful and timely clinical decision support services to health care professionals based on risk stratification models and early detection of exacerbations.\nSENSING-AI focuses on obtaining high-quality data of patients with long COVID-19 during their daily life. Supporting these patients is of paramount importance in the current pandemic situation, including supporting their health care professionals in a cost-effective and efficient management of long COVID-19.\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT05204615; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05204615.\nDERR1-10.2196/37704.", "Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) are on a spectrum of cutaneous drug reactions characterized by pan-epidermal necrosis with SJS affecting < 10% of body surface area (BSA), TEN > 30%, and SJS/TEN overlap between 10 and 30%. Severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis (SCORTEN) is a validated tool to predict mortality rates based on age, heart rate, BSA, malignancy and serum urea, bicarbonate, and glucose. Despite improved understanding, SJS/TEN mortality remains constant and therapeutic interventions are not universally accepted for a number of reasons, including rarity of SJS/TEN; inconsistent definition of cases, disease severity, and endpoints in studies; low efficacy of interventions; and variations in treatment protocols. Apart from mortality, none of the other endpoints used to evaluate interventions, including duration of hospitalization, is sufficiently standardized to be reproducible across cases and treatment centers. Some of the gaps in SJS/TEN research can be narrowed through international collaboration to harmonize research endpoints. A case is made for an urgent international collaborative effort to develop consensus on definitions of endpoints such as disease status, progression, cessation, and complete re-epithelialization in interventional studies. The deficiencies of using BSA as the sole determinant of SJS/TEN severity, excluding internal organ involvement and extension of skin necrosis beyond the epidermis, are discussed and the role these factors play on time to healing and mortality beyond the acute stage is highlighted. The potential role of artificial intelligence, biomarkers, and PET/CT scan with radiolabeled glucose as markers of disease status, activity, and therapeutic response is also discussed.", "The purpose of the study was to create an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detecting idiopathic osteosclerosis (IO) on panoramic radiographs for automatic, routine, and simple evaluations.\nIn this study, a deep learning method was carried out with panoramic radiographs obtained from healthy patients. A total of 493 anonymized panoramic radiographs were used to develop the AI system (CranioCatch, Eskisehir, Turkey) for the detection of IOs. The panoramic radiographs were acquired from the radiology archives of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Eskisehir Osmangazi University. GoogLeNet Inception v2 model implemented with TensorFlow library was used for the detection of IOs. Confusion matrix was used to predict model achievements.\nFifty IOs were detected accurately by the AI model from the 52 test images which had 57 IOs. The sensitivity, precision, and F-measure values were 0.88, 0.83, and 0.86, respectively.\nDeep learning-based AI algorithm has the potential to detect IOs accurately on panoramic radiographs.

The ground truth for each examination was established after an independent review by two radiologists with expertise in musculoskeletal imaging. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third radiologist. Half of the 300 examinations showed at least 1 fracture. Radiographs were read by three senior pediatric radiologists and five radiology residents in the usual manner and then read again immediately after with the help of AI.\nThe mean sensitivity for all groups was 73.3% (110/150) without AI; it increased significantly by almost 10% (P<0.001) to 82.8% (125/150) with AI. For junior radiologists, it increased by 10.3% (P<0.001) and for senior radiologists by 8.2% (P=0.08). On average, there was no significant change in specificity (from 89.6% to 90.3% [+0.7%, P=0.28]); for junior radiologists, specificity increased from 86.2% to 87.6% (+1.4%, P=0.42) and for senior radiologists, it decreased from 95.1% to 94.9% (-0.2%, P=0.23). The stand-alone sensitivity and specificity of the AI were, respectively, 91% and 90%.\nWith the help of AI, sensitivity increased by an average of 10% without significantly decreasing specificity in fracture detection in a predominantly pediatric population.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the performance of tasks by machines ordinarily associated with human intelligence. Machine learning (ML) is a subtype of AI; it refers to the ability of computers to draw conclusions (ie, learn) from data without being directly programmed. ML builds from traditional statistical methods and has drawn significant interest in healthcare epidemiology due to its potential for improving disease prediction and patient care. This review provides an overview of ML in healthcare epidemiology and practical examples of ML tools used to support healthcare decision making at 4\u00a0stages of hospital-based care: triage, diagnosis, treatment, and discharge. Examples include model-building efforts to assist emergency department triage, predicting time before septic shock onset, detecting community-acquired pneumonia, and classifying COVID-19 disposition risk level.

Accrediting bodies strongly recommend and residents desire leadership training. However, limited needs assessment data exist regarding trainee perceptions of and experiences with leadership training. Our objective is to describe residents' perceptions of leadership and desires for leadership training with the goal of informing effective curricular development.\nIn 2019 a trained qualitative interviewer conducted semi-structured interviews with volunteer second-year categorical internal medicine residents recruited via email across four institutions. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and inductively coded by two independent coders. After adjudicating discrepancies, coders synthesized codes into broader themes. Final thematic analysis was triangulated with the entire author group.\nFourteen residents were interviewed (50% female). Few reported prior leadership training. Thematic analysis yielded six main themes. First, residents perceive \"leadership\" to be related to formal, assigned, hierarchical roles. Second, residents identify their own leadership primarily in the inpatient clinical setting. Third, residents identify clinical competence, emotional intelligence, and communication as important skills for effective leadership. Fourth, residents struggle to identify where leadership is currently being taught. Fifth, residents desire additional leadership development. Finally, residents prefer well-labeled, interactive methods for leadership development.\nAlthough residents desire leadership development, these skills are not often explicitly taught, labeled, or assessed. Curriculum developers may consider explicitly contextualizing leadership training within an \"everyday leadership\" framework, dovetailing leadership coaching with daily teaching workflow and feedback structures, and implementing faculty development initiatives to allow for appropriate feedback and assessment of these skills.", "Colonoscopy represents the most widespread and effective tool for the prevention and treatment of early stage preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the panorama of cancer screening. In the world there are different approaches to the topic of colorectal cancer prevention and screening: different starting ages (45-50 years); different initial screening tools such as fecal occult blood with immunohistochemical or immune-enzymatic tests; recto-sigmoidoscopy; and colonoscopy. The key aspects of this scenario are composed of a proper bowel preparation that ensures a valid diagnostic examination, experienced endoscopist in detection of preneoplastic and early neoplastic lesions and open-minded to upcoming artificial intelligence-aided examination, knowledge in the field of resection of these lesions (from cold-snaring, through endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection, up to advanced tools), and management of complications.", "With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) methods, computer-aided drug design (CADD) has developed rapidly in recent years. Effective molecular representation and accurate property prediction are crucial tasks in CADD workflows. In this review, we summarize contemporary applications of deep learning (DL) methods for molecular representation and property prediction. We categorize DL methods according to the format of molecular data (1D, 2D, and 3D). In addition, we discuss some common DL models, such as ensemble learning and transfer learning, and analyze the interpretability methods for these models. We also highlight the challenges and opportunities of DL methods for molecular representation and property prediction.", "Intelligence as a construct of cognitive abilities is the basis of knowledge and skill acquisition and the main predictor of academic achievement. As a broad construct, it is usually divided into subdomains, such as nonverbal and verbal intelligence. Verbal intelligence is one domain of intelligence but is not synonymous with specific linguistic abilities like grammar proficiency. We aim to address the general expectation that early cochlear implantation enables children who are hard of hearing to develop comprehensively, including with respect to verbal intelligence. The primary purpose of this study is to trace the longitudinal development of verbal and nonverbal intelligence in children with cochlear implants (CIs).\nSixteen children with congenital hearing loss who received unilateral or bilateral implants and completed at least two intelligence assessments around the age of school entrance were included in the study. The first assessment was performed around 3 years after CI fitting (chronological age range: 3.93 to 7.03 years). The second assessment was performed approximately 2 years after the first assessment. To analyze verbal and nonverbal IQ in conjunction and across children at different ages, we used corresponding standardized and normalized tests from the same test family (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence and/or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children).\nRegarding longitudinal development, both verbal and nonverbal IQ increased, but verbal IQ increased more substantially over time. At the time of the second measurement, verbal and nonverbal IQ were on a comparable level. Nevertheless, we also observed strong inter-individual differences. The duration between both assessments was significantly associated with verbal IQ at the second measurement time point and thus with verbal IQ gain over time. Education mode (regular vs. special kindergarten/school) was significantly correlated with nonverbal IQ at the second assessment time point.\nThe results, despite the small sample size, clearly suggest that children with CIs can achieve intellectual abilities comparable to those of their normal-hearing peers by around the third year after initial CI fitting, and they continue to improve over the following 2 years. We recommend further research focusing on verbal IQ assessed around the age of school entrance to be used as a predictor for further development and for the establishment of an individual educational program.", "Psychological safety is the concept that an individual feels comfortable asking questions, voicing ideas or concerns, and taking risks without undue fear of humiliation or criticism. In health care, psychological safety is associated with improved patient safety outcomes, increased clinician engagement, and greater creativity. A culture of psychological safety is imperative for physician well-being and satisfaction, which in turn directly affect delivery of care. For health care professionals, psychological safety creates an environment conducive to trust and openness, enabling the team to focus on high-quality care. In contrast, unprofessional behavior reduces psychological safety and threatens the culture of the organization. This patient safety/quality improvement primer considers the barriers and facilitators to psychological safety in health care; outlines principles for creating a psychologically safe environment; and presents strategies for managing conflict, microaggressions, and lapses in professionalism. Individuals and organizations share the responsibility of promoting psychological safety through proactive policies, conflict management, interventions for microaggressions, and cultivation of emotional intelligence.", "Upholding the wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine that the therapeutic principle, method, formula and medicine are coherent with each other, we propose the technical methodology for intelligent creation of component-based Chinese medicine by integrating multidisciplinary knowledge such as artificial intelligence, pharmaceutical informatics, system pharmacology and phytochemistry. Taking the creation of Guanxinning Tablets as an example, we expound the technical principle for creating component-based Chinese medicine and briefly describe the design method for optimizing the entity of Chinese medicine efficacy by rational combination of active components. Our research sought to &quot;clarify and explain&quot; the mechanism of its clinical treatment action through multi-modal and multi-scale systematic pharmacology studies. This work emphatically demonstrates the pilot workshop and engineering validation platform based on the intelligent simulation of whole production process, and outlines the design principles of the intelligent production line for innovative Chinese medicine. The results of industrial research show that the ourself established method for evaluating the process quality controllability and intelligent production line can be applied to manufacturing Guanxining Tablets with high quality. Through the innovative research of multidisciplinary cross-border integration, the present work explored a new way for the creation of modern Chinese medicine.", "Analyzing three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images has become an indispensable procedure for diagnosis and treatment planning of orthodontic patients. Artificial intelligence, especially deep-learning techniques for analyzing image data, shows great potential for medical and dental image analysis and diagnosis. To explore the feasibility of automating measurement of 13 geometric parameters from three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography images taken in natural head position (NHP), this study proposed a smart system that combined a facial profile analysis algorithm with deep-learning models.\nUsing multiple views extracted from the cone beam computed tomography data of 170 cases as a dataset, our proposed method automatically calculated 13 dental parameters by partitioning, detecting regions of interest, and extracting the facial profile. Subsequently, Mask-RCNN, a trained decentralized convolutional neural network was applied to detect 23 landmarks. All the techniques were integrated into a software application with a graphical user interface designed for user convenience. To demonstrate the system's ability to replace human experts, 30 CBCT data were selected for validation. Two orthodontists and one advanced general dentist located required landmarks by using a commercial dental program. The differences between manual and developed methods were calculated and reported as the errors.\nThe intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for intra-observer reliability were 0.98 (0.97-0.99) for observer 1; 0.95 (0.93-0.97) for observer 2; 0.98 (0.97-0.99) for observer 3 after measuring 13 parameters two times at two weeks interval. The combined ICC for intra-observer reliability was 0.97. The ICCs and 95% CI for inter-observer reliability were 0.94 (0.91-0.97). The mean absolute value of deviation was around 1 mm for the length parameters, and smaller than 2\u00b0 for angle parameters. Furthermore, ANOVA test demonstrated the consistency between the measurements of the proposed method and those of human experts statistically (Fdis=2.68, \u0251=0.05).\nThe proposed system demonstrated the high consistency with the manual measurements of human experts and its applicability. This method aimed to help human experts save time and efforts for analyzing three-dimensional CBCT images of orthodontic patients.", "Vision plays an important role in the aesthetic cognition of human beings. When creating dance choreography, human dancers, who always observe their own dance poses in a mirror, understand the aesthetics of those poses and aim to improve their dancing performance. In order to develop artificial intelligence, a robot should establish a similar mechanism to imitate the above human dance behaviour. Inspired by this, this paper designs a way for a robot to visually perceive its own dance poses and constructs a novel dataset of dance poses based on real NAO robots. On this basis, this paper proposes a hierarchical processing network-based approach to automatic aesthetics evaluation of robotic dance poses. The hierarchical processing network first extracts the primary visual features by using three parallel CNNs, then uses a synthesis CNN to achieve high-level association and comprehensive processing on the basis of multi-modal feature fusion, and finally makes an automatic aesthetics decision. Notably, the design of this hierarchical processing network is inspired by the research findings in neuroaesthetics. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve a high correct ratio of aesthetic evaluation at 82.3%, which is superior to the existing methods.", "As remote work has become more common than ever throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, it has drawn special attention from scholars. However, the outcome has been significantly sporadic and fragmented. In our systematic review, we use artificial intelligence-based machine learning tools to examine the relevant extant literature in terms of its dominant topics, diversity, and dynamics. Our results identify-eight research themes: (1) Effect on employees at a personal level, (2) Effect on employees' careers, (3) Family life and gender roles, (4) Health, well-being, and safety, (5) Labor market dynamics, (6) Economic implications, (7) Remote work management, (8) Organizational remote work strategies. With further content analysis, we structure the sporadic research into three overarching categories. Finally, for each category, we offer a detailed agenda for further research.", "Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1-DS) is a rare metabolic encephalopathy. Familial forms are poorly investigated, and no previous studies have explored aspects of Glut1-DS over the course of life: clinical pictures, intelligence, life achievements, and quality of life in adulthood. Clinical, biochemical and genetic data in a cohort of familial Glut1-DS cases were collected from medical records. Intelligence was assessed using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices in adults and children, respectively. An ad hoc interview focusing on life achievements and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire were administered to adult subjects.\nThe clinical picture in adults was characterized by paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED) (80%), fatigue (60%), low intelligence (60%), epilepsy (50%), and migraine (50%). However, 20% of the adults had higher-than-average intelligence. Quality of Life (QoL) seemed unrelated to the presence of PED or fatigue in adulthood. An association of potential clinical relevance, albeit not statistically significant, was found between intelligence and QoL. The phenotype of familial Glut1-DS in children was characterized by epilepsy (83.3%), intellectual disability (50%), and PED (33%).\nThe phenotype of familial Glut1-DS shows age-related differences: epilepsy predominates in childhood; PED and fatigue, followed by epilepsy and migraine, characterize the condition in adulthood. Some adults with familial Glut1-DS may lead regular and fulfilling lives, enjoying the same QoL as unaffected individuals. The disorder tends to worsen from generation to generation, with new and more severe symptoms arising within the same family. Epigenetic studies might be useful to assess the phenotypic variability in Glut1-DS.", "To evaluate the performance of a machine learning based algorithm tool for chest radiographs (CXRs), applied to a consecutive cohort of historical clinical cases, in comparison to expert chest radiologists.\nThe study comprised 1,960 consecutive CXR from primary care referrals and the emergency department (992 and 968 cases respectively), obtained in 2015 at a UK hospital. Two chest radiologists, each with >20 years of experience independently read all studies in consensus to serve as a reference standard. A chest artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, Lunit INSIGHT CXR, was run on the CXRs, and results were correlated with those by the expert readers. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated for the normal and 10 common findings: atelectasis, fibrosis, calcification, consolidation, lung nodules, cardiomegaly, mediastinal widening, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and pneumoperitoneum.\nThe ground truth annotation identified 398 primary care and 578 emergency department datasets containing pathologies. The AI algorithm showed AUROC of 0.881-0.999 in the emergency department dataset and 0.881-0.998 in the primary care dataset. The AUROC for each of the findings between the primary care and emergency department datasets did not differ, except for pleural effusion (0.954 versus 0.988, p<0.001).\nThe AI algorithm can accurately and consistently differentiate normal from major thoracic abnormalities in both acute and non-acute settings, and can serve as a triage tool.", "Cancer is a major public health issue that seriously endangers the public health and social development of China. Future initiatives for cancer prevention and control should continue to adhere to the principle of prioritizing prevention, and comprehensively implement related prevention activities nationwide. This is critical to reducing cancer burden in Chinese residents, especially in the low- and middle-income populations and those living in areas that are less economically developed. In the past several decades, the international community has significantly reduced the incidence of related cancers through primary prevention measures such as tobacco control, improved occupational hygiene, and vaccination. China has also implemented a series of exploratory primary prevention measures among high-risk groups of cancer in specific areas including Xuanwei, Qidong, and Linxian, and achieved encouraging results. However, due to the low level of systematic awareness of cancer risk factors and the lack of awareness and ability of self-health management in Chinese residents, it is urgent to develop novel research tools and methods to further reveal the causes of cancer, and establish innovative mechanisms and systems of primary prevention of cancer at population and individual levels. Based on current status of the transformation of cancer spectrum and the development of digital intelligence, it would be beneficial to establish a smart digital system for primary cancer prevention service that can cover the entire population, integrating authoritative popular science education on primary prevention of cancer, individualized cancer risk assessment, and personalized health management assistant. This will improve primary cancer prevention among the Chinese general population and can help the sustainable development of cancer prevention and control in China.\n\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u662f\u4e25\u91cd\u5371\u5bb3\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u5065\u5eb7\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u9632\u63a7\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u7ee7\u7eed\u575a\u6301\u9884\u9632\u4f18\u5148\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u56fd\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5168\u9762\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e00\u7ea7\u9884\u9632\u76f8\u5173\u4e3e\u63aa\u3002\u9884\u9632\u5bf9\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e2d\u56fd\u5c45\u6c11\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5e7f\u5927\u4e2d\u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u4eba\u7fa4\u53ca\u7ecf\u6d4e\u76f8\u5bf9\u843d\u540e\u5730\u533a\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u8d1f\u62c5\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5341\u5e74\u95f4\uff0c\u56fd\u9645\u793e\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u70df\u8349\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u6539\u5584\u804c\u4e1a\u536b\u751f\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee5\u53ca\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u7b49\u4e00\u7ea7\u9884\u9632\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u3002\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e5f\u5728\u4e91\u5357\u7701\u5ba3\u5a01\u5e02\u3001\u6c5f\u82cf\u7701\u542f\u4e1c\u5e02\u3001\u6cb3\u5357\u7701\u6797\u53bf\u7b49\u7279\u5b9a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u9ad8\u5371\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e00\u7ea7\u9884\u9632\u63aa\u65bd\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u7ee9\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u5c45\u6c11\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u5371\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u6c34\u5e73\u504f\u4f4e\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u5065\u5eb7\u7ba1\u7406\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4e9f\u9700\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u75c5\u56e0\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4eba\u7fa4\u5c42\u9762\u53ca\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u4e00\u7ea7\u9884\u9632\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u548c\u65b0\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u764c\u8c31\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u5168\u6c11\u7684\u96c6\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u4e00\u7ea7\u9884\u9632\u6743\u5a01\u79d1\u666e\u5ba3\u6559\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u5065\u5eb7\u7ba1\u7406\u52a9\u624b\u4e8e\u4e00\u4f53\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u4e00\u7ea7\u9884\u9632\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u670d\u52a1\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4e2d\u56fd\u5c45\u6c11\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u4e00\u7ea7\u9884\u9632\u80fd\u529b\u5c06\u5927\u6709\u88e8\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u52a9\u529b\u4e2d\u56fd\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u9632\u63a7\u4e8b\u4e1a\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002.", "As of 2022, people are getting better at learning how to coexist with the Covid-19 global pandemic. In Saudi Arabia, many attempts have been made to raise public health awareness. However, most health awareness campaigns are generic and might not influence the desired behavior among individuals.\nThis study aims to apply geospatial intelligence and user modeling to profile the districts of the city of Jeddah. This customized map can provide a baseline for a customized health awareness campaign that targets the locals of each district individually based on the virus spread level.\nIt is ongoing research, which has resulted in the creation of a health messages library in the first phase [1]. This paper focuses on a second phase of the research study, which aims to provide a customized baseline for this campaign by applying the geospatial artificial intelligence technique known as space-time cube (STC). STC was applied to create a local map of the Saudi city of Jeddah, representing three different profiles for the city's districts. The model is built using valid COVID-19 clinical data obtained from one of Jeddah's general hospitals.\nWhen applied, STC displays three profiles for the districts of Jeddah city: high infection, moderate infection, and low infection. To assess the geo-intelligent map, a new instrument was created and validated. The usability and practicality of this map were quantitatively evaluated in a cross-sectional survey using the goal-question-metric measurement framework, and a total of 43 participants filled out the questionnaire. The results indicate that the geo-intelligent map is suitable for everyday use, as evidenced by the participants' responses. We argue that the developed instrument can also be used to assess any geo-intelligence map. This research provides a legitimate approach to customizing health awareness messages during pandemics.", "Colonoscopy is a fundamental tool in colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention. Nevertheless, one-fourth of colorectal neoplasms are still missed during colonoscopy, potentially being the main reason for post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer (PCCRC). Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is currently known as the best quality indicator correlating with PCCRC incidence.\nWe performed a literature review in order to summarize evidences investigating key factors affecting ADR: endoscopists education and training, patient management, endoscopic techniques, improved navigation (exposition defect), and enhanced lesions recognition (vision defect) were considered.\n'Traditional' factors, such as split dose bowel preparation, adequate withdrawal time, and right colon second view, held a significant impact on ADR. Several devices and technologies have been developed to promote high-quality colonoscopy, however artificial intelligence may be considered the most promising tool for ADR improvement, provided that endoscopists education and recording are guaranteed.", "Given the specified importance of dietary diversity in reducing the burden of malnutrition, our study explores the reasons for the high rate of malnutrition in India through assessment of a comprehensive range of ecosystem factors leading to poor nutrients intake. The study uses the Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) to investigate preschoolers, through differences in wealth, gender, and health. Demographic and Health Survey (2015-16) data of 1,40,470 preschool children between the ages of 2-5\u00a0years, is investigated using the Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory. Multiple linear regression models developed to investigate the association between variables, depict the importance of vaccination (p-value\u2009<\u20090.01, 95% CI 0.02-0.06) as positively impacting the outcome measures. Interestingly, overall wealth index does not impact the dietary diversity of the child. The lower wealth index, however, significantly impacts the DDS of the female child as compared to the male child (p-value\u2009<\u20090.1, 95% CI -\u00a00.03 to 0.02), indicating that the lower wealth index plays a role in developing the non-egalitarian gender attitudes for female children. Policy implications involve adapting biofortified foods with higher density of nutrients with major focus on female children to minimize the gender gap and leveraging the digital technology such as telemedicine, and advanced techniques such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data to offer real-time surveillance to address the healthcare needs in the ongoing immunization programs.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s41745-022-00339-4.", "This study was aimed to explore the effect of CT image feature extraction of pulmonary nodules based on an artificial intelligence algorithm and the image performance of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. In this study, the CT images of pulmonary nodules were collected as the research object, and the lung nodule feature extraction model based on expectation maximization (EM) was used to extract the image features. The Dice similarity coefficient, accuracy, benign and malignant nodule edges, internal signs, and adjacent structures were compared and analyzed to obtain the extraction effect of this feature extraction model and the image performance of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. The results showed that the detection sensitivity of pulmonary nodules in this model was 0.955, and the pulmonary nodules and blood vessels were well preserved in the image. The probability of burr sign detection in the malignant group was 73.09% and that in the benign group was 8.41%. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The probability of malignant component leaf sign (69.96%) was higher than that of a benign component leaf sign (0), and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The probability of cavitation signs in the malignant group (59.19%) was higher than that in the benign group (3.74%), and the probability of blood vessel collection signs in the malignant group (74.89%) was higher than that in the benign group (11.21%), with statistical significance (P < 0.05). The probability of the pleural traction sign in the malignant group was 17.49% higher than that in the benign group (4.67%), and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In summary, the feature extraction effect of CT images based on the EM algorithm was ideal. Imaging findings, such as the burr sign, lobulation sign, vacuole sign, vascular bundle sign, and pleural traction sign, can be used as indicators to distinguish benign and malignant nodules.", "In the current age of technology, various diseases in the body are also on the rise. Tumours that cause more discomfort in the body are set to increase the discomfort of most patients. Patients experience different effects depending on the tumour size and type. Future developments in the medical field are moving towards the development of tools based on IoT devices. These advances will in the future follow special features designed based on multiple machine learning developed by artificial intelligence. In that order, an improved algorithm named Internet of Things-based enhanced machine learning is proposed in this paper. What makes it special is that it involves separate functions to diagnose each type of tumour. It analyzes and calculates things like the size, shape, and location of the tumour. Cure from cancer is determined by the stage at which we find cancer. Early detection of cancer has the potential to cure quickly. At a saturation point, the proposed Internet of Things-based enhanced machine learning model achieved 94.56% of accuracy, 94.12% of precision, 94.98% of recall, 95.12% of F1-score, and 1856\u2009ms of execution time. The simulation is conducted to test the efficacy of the model, and the results of the simulation show that the proposed Internet of Things-based enhanced machine learning obtains a higher rate of intelligence than other methods.", "Smart court technologies are making full use of modern science to promote the modernization of the trial system and trial capabilities, for example, artificial intelligence, Internet of things, and cloud computing. The smart court technologies can improve the efficiency of case handling and achieving convenience for the people. Article recommendation is an important part of intelligent trial. For ordinary people without legal background, the traditional information retrieval system that searches laws and regulations based on keywords is not applicable because they do not have the ability to extract professional legal vocabulary from complex case processes. This paper proposes a law recommendation framework, called LawRec, based on Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) and Skip-Recurrent Neural Network (Skip-RNN) models. It intends to integrate the knowledge of legal provisions with the case description and uses the BERT model to learn the case description text and legal knowledge, respectively. At last, laws and regulations for cases can be recommended. Experiment results show that the proposed LawRec can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods.", "Na-, K- and Mg-ion batteries (NIBs, KIBs and MIBs) have drawn considerable interest due to their high abundance and excellent safety. However, the lack of high-performance anode materials is a major obstacle to its development. A metallic SnB planar monolayer is predicted by using the two-dimensional global minimum structure search method of swarm intelligence. Based on first-principles calculations, we proved that the metal SnB monolayer has high binding energy and excellent dynamical, thermal and mechanical stability. It is worth noting that the SnB monolayer has several stable adsorption sites for Na-, K- and Mg-ions, so it has a high theoretical capacity of 620.93, 517.44 and 620.93 mA h g-1, respectively. For Na-, K- and Mg-ion batteries, the low diffusion barriers of the SnB monolayer are 0.22, 0.07 and 0.68 eV, and the low average open circuit voltages are 0.42, 0.49 and 0.23 V, which ensure long service life and fast charging in practical applications. In addition, it is proved that the SnB monolayer maintains excellent conductivity and stability during the charge-discharge process. The results show that the SnB monolayer offers innovative advantages for the development of new two-dimensional planar structures that further advance the development of anode materials for metal ion batteries.", "In the elective field of adrenal imaging, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for adrenal lesion detection, characterization, hypersecreting syndrome management and patient follow-up. Although a perfect AI tool that includes all required steps from detection to analysis does not exist yet, multiple AI algorithms have been developed and tested with encouraging results. However, AI in this setting is still at an early stage. In this regard, most published studies about AI in adrenal gland imaging report preliminary results that do not have yet daily applications in clinical practice. In this review, recent developments and current results of AI in the field of adrenal imaging are presented. Limitations and future perspectives of AI are discussed.", "Epilepsy, one of the most common neurological diseases in China, is notorious for its spontaneous, unprovoked and recurrent seizures. The etiology of epilepsy varies among individual patients, including congenital gene mutation, traumatic injury, infections, etc. This heterogeneity partly hampered the accurate diagnosis and choice of appropriate treatments. Encouragingly, great achievements have been achieved in computational science, making it become a key player in medical fields gradually and bringing new hope for rapid and accurate diagnosis as well as targeted therapies in epilepsy. Here, we historically review the advances of computerized applications in epilepsy-especially those tremendous findings achieved in China-for different purposes including seizure prediction, localization of epileptogenic zone, post-surgical prognosis, etc. Special attentions are paid to the great progress based on artificial intelligence (AI), which is more \"sensitive\", \"smart\" and \"in-depth\" than human capacities. At last, we give a comprehensive discussion about the disadvantages and limitations of current computerized applications for epilepsy and propose some future directions as further stepping stones to embrace \"the era of AI\" in epilepsy.", "Hurricanes are one of the most catastrophic natural hazards faced by residents of the United States. Improving the public's hurricane preparedness is essential to reduce the impact and disruption of hurricanes on households. Inherent in traditional methods for quantifying and monitoring hurricane preparedness are significant lags, which hinder effective monitoring of residents' preparedness in advance of an impending hurricane. This study establishes a methodological framework to quantify the extent, timing, and spatial variation of hurricane preparedness at the census block group level using high-resolution location intelligence data. Anonymized cell phone data on visits to points-of-interest for each census block group in Harris County before 2017 Hurricane Harvey were used to examine residents' hurricane preparedness. Four categories of points-of-interest, grocery stores, gas stations, pharmacies and home improvement stores, were identified as they have close relationship with hurricane preparedness, and the daily number of visits from each CBG to these four categories of POIs were calculated during preparation period. Two metrics, extent of preparedness and proactivity, were calculated based on the daily visit percentage change compared to the baseline period. The results show that peak visits to pharmacies often occurred in the early stage of preparation, whereas the peak of visits to gas stations happened closer to hurricane landfall. The spatial and temporal patterns of visits to grocery stores and home improvement stores were quite similar. However, correlation analysis demonstrates that extent of preparedness and proactivity are independent of each other. Combined with synchronous evacuation data, CBGs in Harris County were divided into four clusters in terms of extent of preparedness and evacuation rate. The clusters with low preparedness and low evacuation rate were identified as hotspots of vulnerability for shelter-in-place households that would need urgent attention during response. Hence, the research findings provide a new data-driven approach to quantify and monitor the extent, timing, and spatial variations of hurricane preparedness. Accordingly, the study advances data-driven understanding of human protective actions during disasters. The study outcomes also provide emergency response managers and public officials with novel data-driven insights to more proactively monitor residents' disaster preparedness, making it possible to identify under-prepared areas and better allocate resources in a timely manner.", "We have introduced an artificial intelligence framework, 31P-SPAWNN, in order to fully analyze phosphorus-31 (    31   $$ {}^{31} $$  P) magnetic resonance spectra.

The generation of training and test data using a fully parameterized model is presented herein. In vivo unlocalized free induction decay and three-dimensional    31   $$ {}^{31} $$  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging data were acquired from healthy volunteers before being quantified using either 31P-SPAWNN or traditional least-square fitting techniques.\nThe presented experiment has demonstrated both the reliability and accuracy of 31P-SPAWNN for estimating metabolite concentrations and spectral parameters. Simulated test data showed improved quantification using 31P-SPAWNN compared with LCModel. In vivo data analysis revealed higher accuracy at low signal-to-noise ratio using 31P-SPAWNN, yet with equivalent precision. Processing time using 31P-SPAWNN can be further shortened up to two orders of magnitude.\nThe accuracy, reliability, and computational speed of the method open new perspectives for integrating these applications in a clinical setting.", "COVID-19 rapidly evolved as a pandemic, killing and hospitalising millions of people, and creating unprecedented hurdles for communities and health care systems worldwide. The rapidly evolving pandemic prompted the head of the World Health Organisation to deliver a critical message: \"test, test, test.\" The response from the diagnostic industry and researchers worldwide was overwhelming, resulting in more than a thousand commercial tests being available worldwide. Several sampling approaches and diagnostic techniques have been employed from the early stages of the pandemic, such as SARS-CoV-2 detection by targeting the viral RNA or protein indirectly via antibody testing, biochemical estimation, and various imaging techniques, and many are still in the various stages of development and yet to be marketed. Accurate testing techniques and appropriate sampling are the need of the hour to manage, diagnose and treat the pandemic, especially in the current crisis where SARS-CoV-2 undergoes constant mutation, evolving into various strains, which are pretty challenging. The article discusses various testing techniques as well as screening methods for detection, treatment, and management of COVID-19 transmissions, such as NAAT, PCR, isothermal detection including RT-LAMP, RPA, NASBA, RCA, SDA, NEAR, and TMA, CRISPR strategy, nanotechnology approach, metagenomic profiling, point of care tests, virus neutralization test, ELISA, biomarker estimation, utilization of imaging techniques such as CT, ultrasonography, brain MRI in COVID-19 complications, and other novel strategies including microarray methods, microfluidic methods and artificial intelligence with an emphasis on advancements in the testing strategies for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of COVID-19.", "The study aimed to determine the relationship between the millisecond timing, measured by visual temporal order threshold (TOT), i.e. a minimum gap between two successive stimuli necessary to judge a before-after relation, and resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (rsFC). We assume that the TOT reflects a relatively stable feature of local internal state networks and is associated with rsFC of the temporal parietal junction (TPJ). Sixty five healthy young adults underwent the visual TOT, fluid intelligence (Gf) and an eyes-open resting-state fMRI examination. After controlling for the influence of gender, the higher the TOT, the stronger was the left TPJ's rsFC with the left postcentral and the right precentral gyri, bilateral putamen and the right supplementary motor area. When the effects of Gf and TOT\u2009\u00d7\u2009Gf interaction were additionally controlled, the TOT-left TPJ's rsFC relationship survived for almost all above regions with the exception of the left and right putamen. This is the first study demonstrating that visual TOT is associated with rsFC between the areas involved both in sub-second timing and motor control. Current outcomes indicate that the local neural networks are prepared to process brief, rapidly presented, consecutive events, even in the absence of such stimulation.", "Automatically understanding the content of medical images and delivering accurate descriptions is an emerging field of artificial intelligence that combines skills in both computer vision and natural language processing fields. Medical image captioning is involved in various applications related to diagnosis, treatment, report generation and computer-aided diagnosis to facilitate the decision making and clinical workflows. Unlike generic image captioning, medical image captioning highlights the relationships between image objects and clinical findings, which makes it a very challenging task. Although few review papers have already been published in this field, their coverage is still quite limited and only particular problems are addressed. This motivates the current paper where a rapid review protocol was adopted to review the latest achievements in automatic medical image captioning from the medical domain perspective. We aim through this review to provide the reader with an up-to-date literature in this field by summarizing the key findings and approaches in this field, including the related datasets, applications and limitations as well as highlighting the main competitions, challenges and future directions.", "This review aims to share the current developments of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in the field of medico-dental diagnostics of the face. The primary focus of this review is to present the applicability of artificial neural networks (ANN) to interpret medical images, together with the associated opportunities, obstacles, and ethico-legal concerns.\nNarrative literature review.\nNarrative literature review.\nCurated facial images are widely available and easily accessible and are as such particularly suitable big data for ANN training. New AI solutions have the potential to change contemporary dentistry by optimizing existing processes and enriching dental care with the introduction of new tools for assessment or treatment planning. The analyses of health-related big data may also contribute to revolutionize personalized medicine through the detection of previously unknown associations. In regard to facial images, advances in medico-dental AI-based diagnostics include software solutions for the detection and classification of pathologies, for rating attractiveness and for the prediction of age or gender. In order for an ANN to be suitable for medical diagnostics of the face, the arising challenges regarding computation and management of the software are discussed, with special emphasis on the use of non-medical big data for ANN training. The legal and ethical ramifications of feeding patients' facial images to a neural network for diagnostic purposes are related to patient consent, data privacy, data security, liability, and intellectual property. Current ethico-legal regulation practices seem incapable of addressing all concerns and ensuring accountability.\nWhile this review confirms the many benefits derived from AI solutions used for the diagnosis of medical images, it highlights the evident lack of regulatory oversight, the urgent need to establish licensing protocols, and the imperative to investigate the moral quality of new norms set with the implementation of AI applications in medico-dental diagnostics.", "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated digital transformation (DT). We investigated the trend of the public interest in technologies regarding the DT and Koreans' experiences and their perceptions of the future impact of these technologies.\nUsing Google Trends, the relative search volume (RSV) for topics including \"coronavirus,\" \"artificial intelligence,\" \"cloud,\" \"big data,\" and \"metaverse\" were retrieved for the period from January 2020 to January 2022. A survey was conducted to assess the population's knowledge, experience, and perceptions regarding the DT.\nThe RSV for \"metaverse\" showed an increasing trend, in contrast to those for \"cloud,\" \"big data,\" and \"coronavirus.\" The RSVs for DT-related keywords had a negative correlation with the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases. In our survey, 78.1% responded that the positive impact of the DT on future lives would outweigh the negative impact. The predictors for this positive perception included experiences with the metaverse (4.0-fold) and virtual reality (VR)/augmented reality (AR) education (3.8-fold). Respondents predicted that the biggest change would occur in the healthcare sector after transportation/ communication.\nKoreans' search interest for \"metaverse\" showed an increasing trend during the COVID-19 pandemic. Koreans believe that DT will bring about big changes in the healthcare sector. Most of the survey respondents have a positive outlook about the impact of DT on future life, and the predictors for this positive perception include the experiences with the metaverse or VR/AR education. Healthcare professionals need to accelerate the adoption of DT in clinical practice, education and training.", "The recent global focus on big data in medicine has been associated with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosis and decision-making following recent advances in computer technology. Up to now, AI has been applied to various aspects of medicine, including disease diagnosis, surveillance, treatment, predicting future risk, targeted interventions and understanding of the\u00a0disease. There have been plenty of successful examples in medicine of using big data, such as radiology and pathology, ophthalmology cardiology and surgery. Combining medicine and AI has become a powerful tool to change health care, and even to change the nature of disease screening in clinical diagnosis. As all we know, clinical laboratories produce large amounts of testing data every day and the clinical laboratory data combined with AI may establish a new diagnosis and treatment has attracted wide attention. At present, a new concept of radiomics has been created for imaging data combined with AI, but a new definition of clinical laboratory data combined with AI has lacked so that many studies in this field cannot be accurately classified. Therefore, we propose a new concept of clinical laboratory omics (Clinlabomics) by combining clinical laboratory medicine and AI. Clinlabomics can use high-throughput methods to extract large amounts of feature data from blood, body fluids, secretions, excreta, and cast clinical laboratory test data. Then using the data statistics, machine learning, and other methods to read more undiscovered information. In this review, we have summarized the application of clinical laboratory data combined with AI in medical fields. Undeniable, the application of Clinlabomics is a method that can assist many fields of medicine but still requires further validation in a multi-center environment and laboratory.", "Paediatric acquired brain injury (ABI) causes cognitive and behavioural difficulties and alters the course of child development. The ABI unit at Hospital Infantil Universitario Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas is the first within the public Spanish health system to provide comprehensive coverage to these patients and their families.\nThis study aims to show the working methodology followed with patients and their families, and to describe the clinical characteristics of the patients treated and the outcomes of treatment.\nFifty-three patients aged between 3 months and 16 and a half years received treatment. The conditions treated were brain tumours, stroke, traumatic brain injury, damage secondary to epilepsy surgery, and hypoxia.\nAll patients were evaluated at admission and at discharge. Treatments were adapted to each patient's difficulties and their severity, as well as to the patient's age. Families received individual and group therapy.\nOlder age was associated with better cognitive recovery and shorter duration of treatment. Different conditions show differential impact on intelligence quotient and developmental quotient scores at the beginning of treatment, with hypoxia and encephalitis being associated with greatest severity. Intelligence quotient and developmental quotient scores and visual memory and attention scores at discharge improved significantly after the faceted neuropsychological treatment with respect to scores registered at admission.\nThe care of patients with ABI should include neuropsychological rehabilitation programmes and provide emotional support to the family so that they may actively participate in the recovery of the child or adolescent.", "Reference-based cell-type annotation can significantly reduce time and effort in single-cell analysis by transferring labels from a previously-annotated dataset to a new dataset. However, label transfer by end-to-end computational methods is challenging due to the entanglement of technical (e.g., from different sequencing batches or techniques) and biological (e.g., from different cellular microenvironments) variations, only the first of which must be removed. To address this issue, we propose Polyphony, an interactive transfer learning (ITL) framework, to complement biologists' knowledge with advanced computational methods. Polyphony is motivated and guided by domain experts' needs for a controllable, interactive, and algorithm-assisted annotation process, identified through interviews with seven biologists. We introduce anchors, i.e., analogous cell populations across datasets, as a paradigm to explain the computational process and collect user feedback for model improvement. We further design a set of visualizations and interactions to empower users to add, delete, or modify anchors, resulting in refined cell type annotations. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through quantitative experiments, two hypothetical use cases, and interviews with two biologists. The results show that our anchor-based ITL method takes advantage of both human and machine intelligence in annotating massive single-cell datasets.", "In the context of the new era, the distinctive function of BD (big data) analysis and prediction also introduces a new way of thinking to university IPE (ideological and political education), broadens the domain of university IPE, and enhances the curricular offerings of IPE universities. In order to enhance the intelligence and personalization of the intelligent teaching system, this paper describes in detail the design and implementation processes for each component of the system. It also uses the association mining rule algorithm of data mining. To maintain population diversity, a population initialization method and a neighborhood-based search operator are used, both of which are based on a thorough consideration of the characteristics of complex networks. The neighborhood search strategy enhances the local search capability of the TLBO (Teaching-Learning Based Optimization) algorithm. The optimized TLBO algorithm presented in this paper achieves the highest average modularity value of 0.5238 through testing on real-world data sets. The outcomes demonstrate that the algorithm performs well and is successful in identifying problems in the community.", "The World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. While globally, the relative caseload has been high, Australia's has been relatively low. During the pandemic, radiology services have seen significant changes in workflow across modalities and a reduction in imaging volumes.\nTo investigate differences in modality imaging volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic across a large Victorian public health network.\nA retrospective analysis from January 2019 to December 2020 compared imaging volumes across two periods corresponding to the pandemic's first and second waves. Weekly volumes across patient class, modality and mobile imaging were summed for periods: wave 1 (weeks 11 to 16 for 2019; weeks 63 to 68 for 2020) and wave 2 (weeks 28 to 43 for 2019; weeks 80 to 95 for 2020). Microsoft Power Business Intelligence linked to the radiology information system was used to mine all completed examinations.\nSummed weekly data during the pandemic's first wave showed the greatest decrease of 29.8% in adult outpatient imaging volumes and 46.3% in paediatric emergency department imaging volumes. Adult nuclear medicine demonstrated the greatest decrease of 37.1% for the same period. Paediatric nuclear medicine showed the greatest decrease of 47.8%, with angiography increasing by 50%. The pandemic's second wave demonstrated the greatest decrease of 23.5% in adult outpatient imaging volumes, with an increase of 18.2% in inpatient imaging volumes. The greatest decrease was 28.5% in paediatric emergency department imaging volumes. Nuclear medicine showed the greatest decrease of 37.1% for the same period. Paediatric nuclear medicine showed the greatest decrease of 36.7%. Mobile imaging utilisation increased between 57.8% and 135.1% during the first and second waves. A strong correlation was observed between mobile and non-mobile imaging in the emergency setting (Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.743, P = 0.000). No correlation was observed in the inpatient setting (Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.059, P = 0.554).\nNuclear medicine was most impacted, while computed tomography and angiography were the least affected by the pandemic. The impact was less during the pandemic's second wave. Mobile imaging shows continuous growth during both waves.", "Tactile sensors with both temperature- and pressure-responsive capabilities are critical to enabling future smart artificial intelligence. These sensors can mimic haptic functions of human skin and inevitably suffer from tensile deformation during operation. However, almost all actual multifunctional tactile sensors are either nonstretchable or the sensing signals interfere with each other when stretched. Herein, we propose a stretchable and self-powered temperature-pressure dual functional sensor based on thermogalvanic hydrogels. The sensor operates properly under stretching, which relies on the thermogalvanic effect and constant elastic modulus of hydrogels. The thermogalvanic hydrogel elastomer exhibits an equivalent Seebeck coefficient of -1.21 mV K-1 and a pressure sensitivity of 0.056 kPa-1. Combined with unit array integration, the multifunctional sensor can be used for accurately recording tactile information on human skin and spatial perception. This work provides a conceptual framework and systematic design for stretchable artificial skin, interactive wearables, and smart robots.", "To identify differences in emotional intelligence (EI)-related competencies between fellows and faculty in a cohort of pediatric critical care physicians.\nSingle-center, cross-sectional observation study.\nSeventy-two-bed multidisciplinary pediatric critical care unit at a quaternary children's hospital (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA).\nForty-seven critical care physicians, including 19 fellows and 28 faculty members, were assessed. A multidisciplinary team of 83 physicians, nurses, and nurse practitioners contributed to the assessments.\nNone.\nA multirater EI assessment tool (Emotional and Social Competency Inventory 360) was used to measure EI competencies of participating physicians across 12 core competencies. Utilizing a priori scoring definitions, physician EI competencies were classified as strengths or areas for growth. Results were stratified based on provider experience, generating comparisons between fellow and faculty cohorts. Ninety-four percent (177/188) of distributed assessments were completed. Fellow strengths were identified as organization awareness, achievement orientation, and teamwork; areas for growth were influence and emotional self-awareness. Compared with fellows, faculty members demonstrated additional strengths in the domains of adaptability, emotional self-control, coach and mentor, positive outlook, inspirational leadership, and influence.\nThis study provides the first characterization of EI competencies among trainees and faculty members using a validated multirater assessment tool. The descriptions of physician EI, based on years of experience, are an important piece of the foundation for future explorations into the advancement of physician EI and effective leadership.", "The recent introduction of hybrid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) as a promising imaging modality for breast cancer assessment has prompted fervent research activity on its clinical applications. The current knowledge regarding the possible clinical applications of hybrid PET/MRI is constantly evolving, thanks to the development and clinical availability of hybrid scanners, the development of new PET tracers and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In this state-of-the-art review on the use of hybrid breast PET/MRI, the most promising advanced MRI techniques (diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and chemical exchange saturation transfer) are discussed. Current and experimental PET tracers (18 F-FDG, 18 F-NaF, choline, 18 F-FES, 18 F-FES, 89 Zr-trastuzumab, choline derivatives, 18 F-FLT, and 68 Ga-FAPI-46) are described in order to provide an overview on their molecular mechanisms of action and corresponding clinical applications.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a potentially reliable assistant for the medical imaging recognition. We systematically review articles on the diagnostic performance of AI in OC from medical imaging for the first time.\nThe Medline, Embase, IEEE, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library databases were searched for related studies published until August 1, 2022. Inclusion criteria were studies that developed or used AI algorithms in the diagnosis of OC from medical images. The binary diagnostic accuracy data were extracted to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The study was registered with the PROSPERO, CRD42022324611.\nThirty-four eligible studies were identified, of which twenty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis with a pooled SE of 88% (95%CI: 85-90%), SP of 85% (82-88%), and AUC of 0.93 (0.91-0.95). Analysis for different algorithms revealed a pooled SE of 89% (85-92%) and SP of 88% (82-92%) for machine learning; and a pooled SE of 88% (84-91%) and SP of 84% (80-87%) for deep learning. Acceptable diagnostic performance was demonstrated in subgroup analyses stratified by imaging modalities (Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or Computed Tomography), sample size (\u2264300 or >300), AI algorithms versus clinicians, year of publication (before or after 2020), geographical distribution (Asia or non Asia), and the different risk of bias levels (\u22653 domain low risk or < 3 domain low risk).\nAI algorithms exhibited favorable performance for the diagnosis of OC through medical imaging. More rigorous reporting standards that address specific challenges of AI research could improve future studies.\nThis work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82073647 to Q-JW and No. 82103914 to T-TG), LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program (No. XLYC1907102 to Q-JW), and 345 Talent Project of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University (No. M0268 to Q-JW and No. M0952 to T-TG).", "The purpose of this study was to examine Australian Football athletes' responses to a grade one muscular injury from a psychophysiological perspective to understand the strength of the association between stress, optimism, and cortisol. Forty-five players listed with one professional Australian Football club volunteered for this study. Inclusion criteria consisted of sustaining a muscular injury during the course of the season with four-weeks predicted recovery time (as diagnosed by club medical staff, n=9). The control group were age, position, and career history matched players from the same sample. Players were also matched for their personality (10-item Big Five Personality Inventory) and fluid intelligence (Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices). Injured players and matched controls completed perceived stress and optimism measures (paper-based questions) as well as salivary cortisol testing once per week for four weeks. Significant increases in cortisol (p=0.015) and perceived stress (p<0.001) were observed in injured players, along with a reduction in optimism (p<0.001) returning by week 4. A significant positive correlation was found between perceived stress and cortisol (r= 0.426), and significant negative correlations observed between optimism and cortisol r= -0.257 and perceived stress r= -0.391. This study showed that athletes were significantly stressed and less optimistic during the first two-weeks of recovery compared to matched controls. While not statistically significant, large effects observed in cortisol and stress in the week prior to returning to competition in the injured group suggest these results demonstrate that a multi-modality approach can improve understanding of psychophysiological stress following a grade one muscular injury in Australian Football athletes.", "Diabetes mellitus is the main cause of diabetic retinopathy, the most common cause of blindness worldwide. In order to slow down or prevent vision loss and degeneration, early detection and treatment are essential. For the purpose of detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy on fundus retina images, numerous artificial intelligence-based algorithms have been put forth by the scientific community. Due to its real-time relevance to everyone's lives, smart healthcare is attracting a lot of interest. With the convergence of IoT, this attention has increased. The leading cause of blindness among persons in their working years is diabetic eye disease. Millions of people live in the most populous Asian nations, including China and India, and the number of diabetics among them is on the rise. To provide medical screening and diagnosis for this rising population of diabetes patients, skilled clinicians faced significant challenges. Our objective is to use deep learning techniques to automatically detect blind spots in eyes and determine how serious they may be. We suggest an enhanced convolutional neural network (ECNN) utilizing a genetic algorithm in this paper. The ECNN technique's accuracy results are compared to those of existing approaches like the K-nearest neighbor approach, convolutional neural network, and support vector machine with the genetic algorithm.", "Early detection of pancreatic cancer has long eluded clinicians because of its insidious nature and onset. Often metastatic or locally invasive when symptomatic, most patients are deemed inoperable. In those who are symptomatic, multi-modal imaging modalities evaluate and confirm pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In asymptomatic patients, detected pancreatic lesions can be either solid or cystic. The clinical implications of identifying small asymptomatic solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs) of < 2 cm are tantamount to a better outcome. The accurate detection of SPLs undoubtedly promotes higher life expectancy when resected early, driving the development of existing imaging tools while promoting more comprehensive screening programs. An imaging tool that has matured in its reiterations and received many image-enhancing adjuncts is endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). It carries significant importance when risk stratifying cystic lesions and has substantial diagnostic value when combined with fine needle aspiration/biopsy (FNA/FNB). Adjuncts to EUS imaging include contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS and EUS-elastography, both having improved the specificity of FNA and FNB. This review intends to compile all existing enhancement modalities and explore ongoing research around the most promising of all adjuncts in the field of EUS imaging, artificial intelligence.", "Nurosene's NURO app (nurosene.com) is an innovative smartphone application that gathers and analyzes active self-report metrics from users, empowering them with data-driven health machine intelligence. We present the data collected and analyzed from the initial round of participants who responded to a 12-question survey on their life-style and health status. Exploratory results using a variational autoencoder (VAE) suggested that much of the variability of the 12 dimensional data could be accounted for by two approximately uncorrelated latent variables: one pertaining to stress and sleep, and the other pertaining to exercise and diet. Subsequent modeling of the data using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFAs and CFAs) found that optimal data fits consisted of four factors, namely exercise, diet, stress, and sleep. Covariance values were high between exercise and diet, and between stress and sleep, but much lower between other pairings of non-identical factors. Both EFAs and CFAs provided extra contexts to and quantified the more preliminary VAE observations. Overall, our results significantly reduce the apparent complexity of the response data. This reduction allows for more efficient future stratification and analyses of participants based on simpler latent variables. Our discovery of novel relationships between stress and sleep, and between exercise and diet suggests the possibility of applying predictive analytics in future efforts.", "Binswanger disease is the small vessel form of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Deposition of Alzheimer disease proteins can begin in midlife and progress slowly, whereas aging of the vasculature also can begin in midlife, continuing to progress into old age, making mixed dementia the most common type of dementia. Biomarkers facilitate the early diagnosis of dementias. It is possible to diagnose mixed dementia before autopsy with biomarkers for vascular disease derived from diffusor tensor images on magnetic resonance imaging and Alzheimer disease proteins, A\u03b2 (amyloid \u03b2), and phosphorylated tau, in cerebrospinal fluid or in brain with positron emission tomography. The presence of vascular disease accelerates cognitive decline. Both misfolded proteins and vascular disease promote inflammation, which can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid by the presence of MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases), angiogenic growth factors, and cytokines. MMPs disrupt the blood-brain barrier and break down myelin, producing Binswanger disease's 2 main pathological features. Advances in detecting biomarkers in plasma will provide early detection of dementia and aided by machine learning and artificial intelligence, will enhance diagnosis and form the basis for early treatments.", "There are numerous fresh ways of thinking and creativity as a result of the ongoing development of art design. How do you create a fantastic logo that has extraordinary artistic effects? The incorrect interpretation of artistic graphics can cause a special visual phenomenon known as the contradiction between visual images and objective reality, which causes people's visual systems to produce points of interest. Wrong vision graphics, or visual paradox, can give people a wonderful experience that transcends time and space and reveals the enigmatic beauty that is concealed in the natural order, which is in line with the design goals of sign art. The integration of design and artificial intelligence has drawn a lot of attention as science and technology have advanced. Designing an intelligent and comfortable user experience is more important than ever, especially given the world's growing digital demand. The technical limitations of algorithm black boxes exacerbate the power disparity between humans and algorithms, which is inherent in artificial algorithms. According to its research, artificial intelligence's algorithm is responsible for roughly 60% of its calculations. Random forest technology's current benefits and drawbacks are contrasted with those of popular algorithms, and a clear vision of its potential applications in the future is presented. The artificial algorithm's recommended operation mechanism chooses the algorithm's nontechnical neutrality and value orientation.", "Recently, speech and video information recognition technology (SVRT) has developed rapidly. Introducing SVRT into the emergency medical practice process may lead to improvements in health care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of acceptance of SVRT among patients, caregivers and emergency medical staff.\nStructured questionnaires were developed for the patient or caregiver group and the emergency medical staff group. The survey was performed in one tertiary academic hospital emergency department. Questions were optimized for each specific group, and responses were provided mostly using Likert 5-scales. Additional multivariable logistic regression analyses for the whole cohort and subgroups were conducted to calculate odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) to examine the association between individual characteristics and SVRT acceptance.\nOf 264 participants, respondents demonstrated a positive attitude and acceptance toward SVRT and artificial intelligence (AI) in future; 179 (67.8%) for video recordings, and 190 (72.0%) for speech recordings. A multivariable logistic regression model revealed that several factors were associated with acceptance of SVRT in emergency medical practice: belief in health care improvement by signal analysis technology (OR, 95% CIs: 2.48 (1.15-5.42)) and AI (OR, 95% CIs: 1.70 (0.91-3.17)), reliability of AI application in emergency medicine (OR, 95% CIs: 2.36 (1.28-4.35)) and the security of personal information (OR, 95% CIs: 1.98 (1.10-3.63)).\nA high level of acceptance toward SVRT has been shown in patients or caregivers, and it also appears to be associated with positive attitudes toward new technology, AI and security of personal information.", "It is a well-known worldwide trend to increase the number of animals on dairy farms and to reduce human labor costs. At the same time, there is a growing need to ensure economical animal husbandry and animal welfare. One way to resolve the two conflicting demands is to continuously monitor the animals. In this article, rumen bolus sensor techniques are reviewed, as they can provide lifelong monitoring due to their implementation. The applied sensory modalities are reviewed also using data transmission and data-processing techniques. During the processing of the literature, we have given priority to artificial intelligence methods, the application of which can represent a significant development in this field. Recommendations are also given regarding the applicable hardware and data analysis technologies. Data processing is executed on at least four levels from measurement to integrated analysis. We concluded that significant results can be achieved in this field only if the modern tools of computer science and intelligent data analysis are used at all levels.", "Meiosis is a specialized cell division during reproduction where one round of chromosomal replication is followed by genetic recombination and two rounds of segregation to generate recombined, ploidy-reduced spores. Meiosis is crucial to the generation of new allelic combinations in natural populations and artificial breeding programs. Several plant species are used in meiosis research including the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) which is a globally important crop species. Here we outline the unique combination of attributes that make tomato a powerful model system for meiosis research. These include the well-characterized behavior of chromosomes during tomato meiosis, readily available genomics resources, capacity for genome editing, clonal propagation techniques, lack of recent polyploidy and the possibility to generate hybrids with twelve related wild species. We propose that further exploitation of genome bioinformatics, genome editing and artificial intelligence in tomato will help advance the field of plant meiosis research. Ultimately this will help address emerging themes including the evolution of meiosis, how recombination landscapes are determined, and the effect of temperature on meiosis.", "Measuring the Vestibular-Ocular-Reflex (VOR) gains with the video head impulse test (vHIT) allows for accurate discrimination between peripheral and central causes of acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). In this study, we sought to investigate whether the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) based vestibular stroke classification applied in unprocessed vHIT data is comparable to VOR gain classification.\nWe performed a prospective study from July 2015 until April 2020 on all patients presenting at the emergency department (ED) with signs of an AVS. The patients underwent vHIT followed by a delayed MRI, which served as a gold standard for stroke confirmation. The MRI ground truth labels were then applied to train a recurrent neural network (long short-term memory architecture) that used eye- and head velocity time series extracted from the vHIT examinations.\nWe assessed 57 AVS patients, 39 acute unilateral vestibulopathy patients (AUVP) and 18 stroke patients. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting stroke with a VOR gain cut-off of 0.57 was 88.8, 92.3, and 91.2%, respectively. The trained neural network was able to classify strokes with a sensitivity of 87.7%, a specificity of 88.4%, and an accuracy of 87.9% based on the unprocessed vHIT data. The accuracy of these two methods was not significantly different (p = 0.09).\nAI can accurately diagnose a vestibular stroke by using unprocessed vHIT time series. The quantification of eye- and head movements with the use of machine learning and AI can serve in the future for an automated diagnosis in ED patients with acute dizziness. The application of different neural network architectures can potentially further improve performance and enable direct inference from raw video recordings.", "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), which is a developing technology in medical applications that assists physicians in making more informed decisions regarding patients' courses of treatment, has become increasingly widespread in recent years in the field of healthcare. On the other hand, the number of PET scans that are being performed is rising, and radiologists are getting significantly overworked as a result. As a direct result of this, a novel approach that goes by the name \"computer-aided diagnostics\" is now being investigated as a potential method for reducing the tremendous workloads. A Smart Lung Tumor Detector and Stage Classifier (SLD-SC) is presented in this study as a hybrid technique for PET scans. This detector can identify the stage of a lung tumour. Following the development of the modified LSTM for the detection of lung tumours, the proposed SLD-SC went on to develop a Multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) for the classification of the various stages of lung cancer. This network was then modelled and validated utilising standard benchmark images. The suggested SLD-SC is now being evaluated on lung cancer pictures taken from patients with the disease. We observed that our recommended method gave good results when compared to other tactics that are currently being used in the literature. These findings were outstanding in terms of the performance metrics accuracy, recall, and precision that were assessed. As can be shown by the much better outcomes that were achieved with each of the test images that were used, our proposed method excels its rivals in a variety of respects. In addition to this, it achieves an average accuracy of 97 percent in the categorization of lung tumours, which is much higher than the accuracy achieved by the other approaches.", "Nursing shortages are a persistent and concerning problem for the nursing workforce worldwide. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought additional stressors and workloads and has worsened nursing shortages.\nTo investigate interrelationships among emotional intelligence, job performance, and turnover intentions of nurses during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and explore the mediating effect of job performance between emotional intelligence and turnover intentions.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted. In total, 673 nurses working in a medical centre hospital in northern Taiwan were recruited from November 2020 to April 2021. An anonymous questionnaire was used in this survey. Data were collected using a seven-item turnover intention scale, a 16-item emotional intelligence scale, a 24-item job performance scale, and demographic questions. A path analysis was performed. This study was based on STROBE guidelines.\nStatistically significant correlations between turnover intentions and emotional intelligence (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.10, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012), between turnover intentions and job performance (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.13, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and between emotional intelligence and job performance (r\u00a0=\u00a00.54, p < 0.001) were detected. Model fit indices were adequate. Job performance had a significant indirect effect between emotional intelligence and turnover intentions (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.16, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011).\nIt was found that job performance was a mediator between emotional intelligence and turnover intentions during the pandemic. The study results support the need to continue to create healthy work environments.\nThese results can assist hospitals in developing specific evidence-based interventions such as showing appreciation and providing acknowledgments to reduce turnover of their nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the study of algorithms that enable machines to analyze and execute cognitive activities including problem solving, object and word recognition, reduce the inevitable errors to improve the diagnostic accuracy, and decision-making. Hepatobiliary procedures are technically complex and the use of AI in perioperative management can improve patient outcomes as discussed below. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of images obtained via ultrasound, computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging, can help surgeons better visualize the surgical sites with added depth perception. Pre-operative 3D planning is associated with lesser operative time and intraoperative complications. Also, a more accurate assessment is noted, which leads to fewer operative complications. Images can be converted into physical models with 3D printing technology, which can be of educational value to students and trainees. 3D images can be combined to provide 3D visualization, which is used for preoperative navigation, allowing for more precise localization of tumors and vessels. Nevertheless, AI enables surgeons to provide better, personalized care for each patient.", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a global health challenge, with an estimated 55 million people suffering from the non-curable disease across the world. While amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain define AD proteinopathy, it has become evident that diverse coding and non-coding regions of the genome may significantly contribute to AD neurodegeneration. The diversity of factors associated with AD pathogenesis, coupled with age-associated damage, suggests that a series of triggering events may be required to initiate AD. Since somatic mutations accumulate with aging, and aging is a major risk factor for AD, there is a great potential for somatic mutational events to drive disease. Indeed, recent data from the Gozes team/laboratories as well as other leading laboratories correlated the accumulation of somatic brain mutations with the progression of tauopathy. In this review, we lay the current perspectives on the principal genetic factors associated with AD and the potential causes, highlighting the contribution of somatic mutations to the pathogenesis of late onset Alzheimer's disease. The roles that artificial intelligence and big data can play in accelerating the progress of causal somatic mutation markers/biomarkers identification, and the associated drug discovery/repurposing, have been highlighted for future AD and other neurodegenerations, with the aim to bring hope for the vulnerable aging population.", "To evaluate the diagnostic reliability of a web-based Artificial Intelligence program on the detection and classification of dental structures and treatments present on panoramic radiographs.\nA total of 300 orthopantomographies (OPG) were randomly selected for this study. First, the images were visually evaluated by two calibrated operators with radiodiagnosis experience that, after consensus, established the \"ground truth\". Operators' findings on the radiographs were collected and classified as follows: metal restorations (MR), resin-based restorations (RR), endodontic treatment (ET), Crowns (C) and Implants (I). The orthopantomographies were then anonymously uploaded and automatically analyzed by the web-based software (Denti.Ai). Results were then stored, and a statistical analysis was performed by comparing them with the ground truth in terms of Sensitivity (S), Specificity (E), Positive Predictive Value (PPV) Negative Predictive Value (NPV) and its later representation in the area under (AUC) the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve.\nDiagnostic metrics obtained for each study variable were as follows: (MR) S=85.48%, E=87.50%, PPV=82.8%, NPV=42.51%, AUC=0.869; (PR) S=41.11%, E=93.30%, PPV=90.24%, NPV=87.50%, AUC=0.672; (ET) S=91.9%, E=100%, PPV=100%, NPV=94.62%, AUC=0.960; (C) S=89.53%, E=95.79%, PPV=89.53%, NPV=95.79%, AUC=0.927; (I) S, E, PPV, NPV=100%, AUC=1.000.\nFindings suggest that the web-based Artificial intelligence software provides a good performance on the detection of implants, crowns, metal fillings and endodontic treatments, not being so accurate on the classification of dental structures or resin-based restorations.\nGeneral diagnostic and treatment decisions using orthopantomographies can be improved by using web-based artificial intelligence tools, avoiding subjectivity and lapses from the clinician.", "Computational properties of neuronal networks have been applied to computing systems using simplified models comprising repeated connected nodes, e.g., perceptrons, with decision-making capabilities and flexible weighted links. Analogously to their revolutionary impact on computing, neuro-inspired models can transform synthetic gene circuit design in a manner that is reliable, efficient in resource utilization, and readily reconfigurable for different tasks. To this end, we introduce the perceptgene, a perceptron that computes in the logarithmic domain, which enables efficient implementation of artificial neural networks in Escherichia coli cells. We successfully modify perceptgene parameters to create devices that encode a minimum, maximum, and average of analog inputs. With these devices, we create multi-layer perceptgene circuits that compute a soft majority function, perform an\u00a0analog-to-digital conversion, and implement a ternary switch. We also create a programmable perceptgene circuit whose computation can be modified from OR to AND logic using small molecule induction. Finally, we show that our approach enables circuit optimization via artificial intelligence algorithms.", "To compare the level of burnout and emotional intelligence among junior and senior medical officers.\nThe cross-sectional observational study was conducted at the Department of Applied Psychology, Government College Women University, Faisalabad, Pakistan, from February to December 2017, and comprised medical officers of either gender aged 25-45 years with professional experience 1-10 years enrolled from different government and private hospitals of Faisalabad and Lahore. Data was collected using Schutte Emotional intelligence Test and Professional Quality of Life scale. Data wsa analysed using SPSS 21.\nOf the 160 subjects, 90(56.3%) were male and 70(43.8%) were female medical officers. The overall mean age was 29.39\u00b14.65 years, Further, 95(59.4%) subjects had professional experience 1-2 years, while 65(40.6%) had 3-10 years. Junior medical officers experienced significantly higher level of burnout and emotional intelligence compared to the seniors (p<0.05).\nJunior medical officers were found to have significantly higher level of burnout and emotional intelligence compared to the seniors.", "The literature is rich in techniques and methods to perform Continuous Authentication (CA) using biometric data, both physiological and behavioral. As a recent trend, less invasive methods such as the ones based on context-aware recognition allows the continuous identification of the user by retrieving device and app usage patterns. However, a still uncovered research topic is to extend the concepts of behavioral and context-aware biometric to take into account all the sensing data provided by the Internet of Things (IoT) and the smart city, in the shape of user habits. In this paper, we propose a meta-model-driven approach to mine user habits, by means of a combination of IoT data incoming from several sources such as smart mobility, smart metering, smart home, wearables and so on. Then, we use those habits to seamlessly authenticate users in real time all along the smart city when the same behavior occurs in different context and with different sensing technologies. Our model, which we called WoX+, allows the automatic extraction of user habits using a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique focused on high-level concepts. The aim is to continuously authenticate the users using their habits as behavioral biometric, independently from the involved sensing hardware. To prove the effectiveness of WoX+ we organized a quantitative and qualitative evaluation in which 10 participants told us a spending habit they have involving the use of IoT. We chose the financial domain because it is ubiquitous, it is inherently multi-device, it is rich in time patterns, and most of all it requires a secure authentication. With the aim of extracting the requirement of such a system, we also asked the cohort how they expect WoX+ will use such habits to securely automatize payments and identify them in the smart city. We discovered that WoX+ satisfies most of the expected requirements, particularly in terms of unobtrusiveness of the solution, in contrast with the limitations observed in the existing studies. Finally, we used the responses given by the cohorts to generate synthetic data and train our novel AI block. Results show that the error in reconstructing the habits is acceptable: Mean Squared Error Percentage (MSEP) 0.04%.", "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology has been attracting great interest from both academia and industry due to its huge potential impact on improving driving experiences and enabling better transportation systems. While a large number of interesting IoV applications are expected, it is more challenging to design an efficient IoV system compared with conventional Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to the mobility of vehicles and complex road conditions. We discuss existing studies about enabling collaborative intelligence in IoV systems by focusing on collaborative communications, collaborative computing, and collaborative machine learning approaches. Based on comparison and discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of recent studies, we point out open research issues and future research directions.", "With the rapid development of deep learning, automatic lesion detection is used widely in clinical screening. To solve the problem that existing deep learning-based cervical precancerous lesion detection algorithms cannot meet high classification accuracy and fast running speed at the same time, a ShuffleNet-based cervical precancerous lesion classification method is proposed. By adding channel attention to the ShuffleNet, the network performance is improved. In this study, the image dataset is classified into five categories: normal, cervical cancer, LSIL (CIN1), HSIL (CIN2/CIN3), and cervical neoplasm. The colposcopy images are expanded to solve the problems of the lack of colposcopy images and the uneven distribution of images from each category. For the test dataset, the accuracy of the proposed CNN models is 81.23% and 81.38%. Our classifier achieved an AUC score of 0.99. The experimental results show that the colposcopy image classification network based on artificial intelligence has good performance in classification accuracy and model size, and it has high clinical applicability.", "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into mental health holds the promise of increasing patient access, engagement, and quality of care, and of improving clinician quality of work life. However, to date, studies of AI technologies in mental health have focused primarily on challenges that policymakers, clinical leaders, and data and computer scientists face, rather than on challenges that frontline mental health clinicians are likely to face as they attempt to integrate AI-based technologies into their everyday clinical practice. In this Perspective, we describe a framework for \"pragmatic AI-augmentation\" that addresses these issues by describing three categories of emerging AI-based mental health technologies which frontline clinicians can leverage in their clinical practice-automation, engagement, and clinical decision support technologies. We elaborate the potential benefits offered by these technologies, the likely day-to-day challenges they may raise for mental health clinicians, and some solutions that clinical leaders and technology developers can use to address these challenges, based on emerging experience with the integration of AI technologies into clinician daily practice in other healthcare disciplines.", "This study investigates the relations of resilience with coping, personality traits, emotional intelligence, sense of coherence and maladaptive personality traits.\nThe study employs network analysis techniques to the study of resilience, showcasing how these methods can estimate a model that is simple to interpret while still retaining the most important relations and that can even suggest the direction of causality despite using a cross-sectional design (N\u00a0=\u00a0305).\nThe results highlight several important variables that should be considered for fostering resilience, foremost among them the use of positive reappraisal coping, sense of coherence, and the social management aspect of emotional intelligence.\nThe results successfully replicated known associations between resilience and other psychological constructs (emotional intelligence, personality, sense of coherence, coping) and shed light on relations between resilience and maladaptive personality traits. Network analysis considered all these constructs together, so as to take into account the complex pattern of relations between them and offer a bird's eye view of the whole network of associations centred on resilience. The resulting model is parsimonious and easy to interpret while still striving to preserve the complexity of the variables' interrelations.", "Human pose estimation has long been a fundamental problem in computer vision and artificial intelligence. Prominent among the 2D human pose estimation (HPE) methods are the regression-based approaches, which have been proven to achieve excellent results. However, the ground-truth labels are usually inherently ambiguous in challenging cases such as motion blur, occlusions, and truncation, leading to poor performance measurement and lower levels of accuracy. In this paper, we propose Cofopose, which is a two-stage approach consisting of a person and keypoint detection transformers for 2D human pose estimation. Cofopose is composed of conditional cross-attention, a conditional DEtection TRansformer (conditional DETR), and an encoder-decoder in the transformer framework; this allows it to achieve person and keypoint detection. In a significant departure from other approaches, we use conditional cross-attention and fine-tune conditional DETR for our person detection, and encoder-decoders in the transformers for our keypoint detection. Cofopose was extensively evaluated using two benchmark datasets, MS COCO and MPII, achieving an improved performance with significant margins over the existing state-of-the-art frameworks.", "The demand for agricultural products increased exponentially as the global population grew. The rapid development of computer vision-based artificial intelligence and deep learning-related technologies has impacted a wide range of industries, including disease detection and classification. This paper introduces a novel neural network-based hybrid model (GCL). GCL is a dataset-augmentation fusion of long-short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) with generative adversarial network (GAN). GAN is used for the augmentation of the dataset, CNN extracts the features and LSTM classifies the various paddy diseases. The GCL model is being investigated to improve the classification model's accuracy and reliability. The dataset was compiled using secondary resources such as Mendeley, Kaggle, UCI, and GitHub, having images of bacterial blight, leaf smut, and rice blast. The experimental setup for proving the efficacy of the GCL model demonstrates that the GCL is suitable for disease classification and works with 97% testing accuracy. GCL can further be used for the classification of more diseases of paddy.", "Capsule endoscopy has revolutionized the management of patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Nevertheless, reading capsule endoscopy images is time-consuming and prone to overlooking significant lesions, thus limiting its diagnostic yield. We aimed to create a deep learning algorithm for automatic detection of blood and hematic residues in the enteric lumen in capsule endoscopy exams.\nA convolutional neural network was developed based on a total pool of 22,095 capsule endoscopy images (13,510 images containing luminal blood and 8,585 of normal mucosa or other findings). A training dataset comprising 80% of the total pool of images was defined. The performance of the network was compared to a consensus classification provided by 2 specialists in capsule endoscopy. Subsequently, we evaluated the performance of the network using an independent validation dataset (20% of total image pool), calculating its sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision.\nOur convolutional neural network detected blood and hematic residues in the small bowel lumen with an accuracy and precision of 98.5 and 98.7%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 98.6 and 98.9%, respectively. The analysis of the testing dataset was completed in 24 s (approximately 184 frames/s).\nWe have developed an artificial intelligence tool capable of effectively detecting luminal blood. The development of these tools may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of capsule endoscopy when evaluating patients presenting with obscure small bowel bleeding.\nA endoscopia por c\u00e1psula revolucionou a abordagem a doentes com hemorragia digestiva obscura.

During the present research, electroencephalography (EEG) responses and self-reported liking and emotions were collected on different stimuli (odor, taste, flavor samples) to better understand sweetness perception. Artificial intelligence analytics were used to classify the implicit responses, identifying decision trees to discriminate the stimuli by activated sensory system (odor/taste/flavor) and by nature of the stimuli ('sweet' vs. 'non-sweet' odors; 'sweet-taste', 'sweet-flavor', and 'non-sweet flavor'; and 'sweet stimuli' vs. 'non-sweet stimuli'). Significant differences were found among self-reported-liking of the stimuli and the emotions elicited by the stimuli, but no clear relationship was identified between explicit and implicit data. The present research sums interesting data for the EEG-linked research as well as for EEG data analysis, although much is still unknown about how to properly exploit implicit measurement technologies and their data.", "Over the past decade, ocular imaging strategies have greatly advanced the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with optic neuropathies. Developments in optic nerve imaging have specifically improved the care of patients with papilloedema and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, inflammatory optic neuropathies, and compressive optic neuropathies. For example, optic nerve imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) is now widely used as an outcome measure in clinical trials of neurological disorders (eg, demyelinating diseases), and OCT findings could be informative of disease progression in patients with various neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease). In the past 5 years, multimodality optic nerve imaging has expanded to systematically include focused and wide-field colour and autofluorescence fundus photographs; various types of optic nerve, macular, and vascular OCT; and specific MRI techniques. Such multimodality imaging makes the diagnosis of optic neuropathies easier and provides objective information on optic nerve damage, which is useful for prognosis. Non-mydriatic ocular fundus cameras and OCT have become readily available in non-ophthalmic settings and could easily be implemented in neurological clinics and emergency departments, allowing for direct access to optic nerve imaging and enabling teleconsultations. In the future, these imaging studies could be used in association with artificial intelligence deep-learning systems, which are already transforming the field of ocular imaging.", "Objective: To explore a new artificial intelligence (AI)-aided method to assist the clinical diagnosis of femoral intertrochanteric fracture (FIF), and further compare the performance with human level to confirm the effect and feasibility of the AI algorithm. Methods: 700 X-rays of FIF were collected and labeled by two senior orthopedic physicians to set up the database, 643 for the training database and 57 for the test database. A Faster-RCNN algorithm was applied to be trained and detect the FIF on X-rays. The performance of the AI algorithm such as accuracy, sensitivity, miss diagnosis rate, specificity, misdiagnosis rate, and time consumption was calculated and compared with that of orthopedic attending physicians. Results: Compared with orthopedic attending physicians, the Faster-RCNN algorithm performed better in accuracy (0.88 vs. 0.84 \u00b1 0.04), specificity (0.87 vs. 0.71 \u00b1 0.08), misdiagnosis rate (0.13 vs. 0.29 \u00b1 0.08), and time consumption (5\u00a0min vs. 18.20 \u00b1 1.92\u00a0min). As for the sensitivity and missed diagnosis rate, there was no statistical difference between the AI and orthopedic attending physicians (0.89 vs. 0.87 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.11 vs. 0.13 \u00b1 0.03). Conclusion: The AI diagnostic algorithm is an available and effective method for the clinical diagnosis of FIF. It could serve as a satisfying clinical assistant for orthopedic physicians.", "Wearable technologies are small electronic and mobile devices with wireless communication capabilities that can be worn on the body as a part of devices, accessories or clothes. Sensors incorporated within wearable devices enable the collection of a broad spectrum of data that can be processed and analysed by artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In this narrative review, we performed a literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus databases. We included any original studies that used sensors to collect data for a sporting event and subsequently used an AI-based system to process the data with diagnostic, treatment or monitoring intents. The included studies show the use of AI in various sports including basketball, baseball and motor racing to improve athletic performance. We classified the studies according to the stage of an event, including pre-event training to guide performance and predict the possibility of injuries; during events to optimise performance and inform strategies; and in diagnosing injuries after an event. Based on the included studies, AI techniques to process data from sensors can detect patterns in physiological variables as well as positional and kinematic data to inform how athletes can improve their performance. Although AI has promising applications in sports medicine, there are several challenges that can hinder their adoption. We have also identified avenues for future work that can provide solutions to overcome these challenges.", "The combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and artificial intelligence is significant and is a key topic in recent substation inspection applications; and meter reading is one of the challenging tasks. This paper proposes a method based on the combination of YOLOv5s object detection and Deeplabv3+ image segmentation to obtain meter readings through the post-processing of segmented images. Firstly, YOLOv5s was introduced to detect the meter dial area and the meter was classified. Following this, the detected and classified images were passed to the image segmentation algorithm. The backbone network of the Deeplabv3+ algorithm was improved by using the MobileNetv2 network, and the model size was reduced on the premise that the effective extraction of tick marks and pointers was ensured. To account for the inaccurate reading of the meter, the divided pointer and scale area were corroded first, and then the concentric circle sampling method was used to flatten the circular dial area into a rectangular area. Several analog meter readings were calculated by flattening the area scale distance. The experimental results show that the mean average precision of 50 (mAP50) of the YOLOv5s model with this method in this data set reached 99.58%, that the single detection speed reached 22.2 ms, and that the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of the image segmentation model reached 78.92%, 76.15%, 79.12%, 81.17%, and 75.73%, respectively. The single segmentation speed reached 35.1 ms. At the same time, the effects of various commonly used detection and segmentation algorithms on the recognition of meter readings were compared. The results show that the method in this paper significantly improved the accuracy and practicability of substation meter reading detection in complex situations.", "In recent years, the number of studies using whole-slide imaging (WSIs) of histopathology slides has expanded significantly. For the development and validation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, glass slides from retrospective cohorts including patient follow-up data have been digitized. It has become crucial to determine that the quality of such resources meets the minimum requirements for the development of AI in the future. The need for automated quality control is one of the obstacles preventing the clinical implementation of digital pathology work processes. As a consequence of the inaccuracy of scanners in determining the focus of the image, the resulting visual blur can render the scanned slide useless. Moreover, when scanned at a resolution of 20\u00d7 or higher, the resulting picture size of a scanned slide is often enormous. Therefore, for digital pathology to be clinically relevant, computational algorithms must be used to rapidly and reliably measure the picture's focus quality and decide if an image requires re-scanning. We propose a metric for evaluating the quality of digital pathology images that uses a sum of even-derivative filter bases to generate a human visual-system-like kernel, which is described as the inverse of the lens' point spread function. This kernel is then used for a digital pathology image to change high-frequency image data degraded by the scanner's optics and assess the patch-level focus quality. Through several studies, we demonstrate that our technique correlates with ground-truth z-level data better than previous methods, and is computationally efficient. Using deep learning techniques, our suggested system is able to identify positive and negative cancer cells in images. We further expand our technique to create a local slide-level focus quality heatmap, which can be utilized for automated slide quality control, and we illustrate our method's value in clinical scan quality control by comparing it to subjective slide quality ratings. The proposed method, GoogleNet, VGGNet, and ResNet had accuracy values of 98.5%, 94.5%, 94.00%, and 95.00% respectively.", "Recently, fake news has been widely spread through the Internet due to the increased use of social media for communication. Fake news has become a significant concern due to its harmful impact on individual attitudes and the community's behavior. Researchers and social media service providers have commonly utilized artificial intelligence techniques in the recent few years to rein in fake news propagation. However, fake news detection is challenging due to the use of political language and the high linguistic similarities between real and fake news. In addition, most news sentences are short, therefore finding valuable representative features that machine learning classifiers can use to distinguish between fake and authentic news is difficult because both false and legitimate news have comparable language traits. Existing fake news solutions suffer from low detection performance due to improper representation and model design. This study aims at improving the detection accuracy by proposing a deep ensemble fake news detection model using the sequential deep learning technique. The proposed model was constructed in three phases. In the first phase, features were extracted from news contents, preprocessed using natural language processing techniques, enriched using n-gram, and represented using the term frequency-inverse term frequency technique. In the second phase, an ensemble model based on deep learning was constructed as follows. Multiple binary classifiers were trained using sequential deep learning networks to extract the representative hidden features that could accurately classify news types. In the third phase, a multi-class classifier was constructed based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) and trained using the features extracted from the aggregated outputs of the deep learning-based binary classifiers for final classification. The two popular and well-known datasets (LIAR and ISOT) were used with different classifiers to benchmark the proposed model. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, which use deep contextualized representation with convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed model shows significant improvements (2.41%) in the overall performance in terms of the F1score for the LIAR dataset, which is more challenging than other datasets. Meanwhile, the proposed model achieves 100% accuracy with ISOT. The study demonstrates that traditional features extracted from news content with proper model design outperform the existing models that were constructed based on text embedding techniques.", "Green smart building is the development direction of future architecture. It is of great significance to carry out risk assessment. Fire risk is the key content of building risk, so this paper takes fire risk as the research object, with the help of artificial intelligence technology, to carry out the risk assessment research of green smart buildings. With the rapid development of the economy, urban fire risk factors are increasing, and the fire situation is becoming more and more serious. Building fire risk assessment is an important measure to effectively prevent and control urban building fires.

Little is known about the molecular bases of individual differences in EFs. Prior candidate gene studies have been underpowered in their search for dopaminergic processes involved in cognitive functioning, and existing genome-wide association studies of EFs used small sample sizes and/or focused on individual tasks that are imprecise measures of EFs.\nWe conducted a genome-wide association study of a common EF (cEF) factor score based on multiple tasks in the UK Biobank (n\u00a0= 427,037 individuals of European descent).\nWe found 129 independent genome-wide significant lead variants in 112 distinct loci. cEF was associated with fast synaptic transmission processes (synaptic, potassium channel, and GABA [gamma-aminobutyric acid] pathways) in gene-based analyses. cEF was genetically correlated with measures of intelligence (IQ) and cognitive processing speed, but cEF and IQ showed differential genetic associations with psychiatric disorders and educational attainment.\nResults suggest that cEF is a genetically distinct cognitive construct that is particularly relevant to understanding the genetic variance in psychiatric disorders.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) methods for the automatic detection and quantification of COVID-19 lesions in chest computed tomography (CT) might play an important role in the monitoring and management of the disease. We organized an international challenge and competition for the development and comparison of AI algorithms for this task, which we supported with public data and state-of-the-art benchmark methods. Board Certified Radiologists annotated 295 public images from two sources (A and B) for algorithms training (n=199, source A), validation (n=50, source A) and testing (n=23, source A; n=23, source B). There were 1,096 registered teams of which 225 and 98 completed the validation and testing phases, respectively. The challenge showed that AI models could be rapidly designed by diverse teams with the potential to measure disease or facilitate timely and patient-specific interventions. This paper provides an overview and the major outcomes of the COVID-19 Lung CT Lesion Segmentation Challenge - 2020.", "In cancer research, high-throughput screening technologies produce large amounts of multiomics data from different populations and cell types. However, analysis of such data encounters difficulties due to disease heterogeneity, further exacerbated by human biological complexity and genomic variability. The specific profile of cancer as a disease (or, more realistically, a set of diseases) urges the development of approaches that maximize the effect while minimizing the dosage of drugs. Now is the time to redefine the approach to drug discovery, bringing an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered informational view that integrates the relevant scientific fields and explores new territories.\nHere, we show SYNPRED, an interdisciplinary approach that leverages specifically designed ensembles of AI algorithms, as well as links omics and biophysical traits to predict anticancer drug synergy. It uses 5 reference models (Bliss, Highest Single Agent, Loewe, Zero Interaction Potency, and Combination Sensitivity Score), which, coupled with AI algorithms, allowed us to attain the ones with the best predictive performance and pinpoint the most appropriate reference model for synergy prediction, often overlooked in similar studies. By using an independent test set, SYNPRED exhibits state-of-the-art performance metrics either in the classification (accuracy, 0.85; precision, 0.91; recall, 0.90; area under the receiver operating characteristic, 0.80; and F1-score, 0.91) or in the regression models, mainly when using the Combination Sensitivity Score synergy reference model (root mean square error, 11.07; mean squared error, 122.61; Pearson, 0.86; mean absolute error, 7.43; Spearman, 0.87). Moreover, data interpretability was achieved by deploying the most current and robust feature importance approaches. A simple web-based application was constructed, allowing easy access by nonexpert researchers.\nThe performance of SYNPRED rivals that of the existing methods that tackle the same problem, yielding unbiased results trained with one of the most comprehensive datasets available (NCI ALMANAC). The leveraging of different reference models allowed deeper insights into which of them can be more appropriately used for synergy prediction. The Combination Sensitivity Score clearly stood out with improved performance among the full scope of surveyed approaches and synergy reference models. Furthermore, SYNPRED takes a particular focus on data interpretability, which has been in the spotlight lately when using the most advanced AI techniques.", "Conducting data analysis tasks rarely occur in isolation. Especially in intelligence analysis scenarios where different experts contribute knowledge to a shared understanding, members must communicate how insights develop to establish common ground among collaborators. The use of provenance to communicate analytic sensemaking carries promise by describing the interactions and summarizing the steps taken to reach insights. Yet, no universal guidelines exist for communicating provenance in different settings. Our work focuses on the presentation of provenance information and the resulting conclusions reached and strategies used by new analysts. In an open-ended, 30-minute, textual exploration scenario, we qualitatively compare how adding different types of provenance information (specifically data coverage and interaction history) affects analysts' confidence in conclusions developed, propensity to repeat work, filtering of data, identification of relevant information, and typical investigation strategies. We see that data coverage (i.e., what was interacted with) provides provenance information without limiting individual investigation freedom. On the other hand, while interaction history (i.e., when something was interacted with) does not significantly encourage more mimicry, it does take more time to comfortably understand, as represented by less confident conclusions and less relevant information-gathering behaviors. Our results contribute empirical data towards understanding how provenance summarizations can influence analysis behaviors.", "The objective of this study is to analyse co-authorship and co-citation networks of publications in the field of artificial intelligence in ophthalmology and optometry. As well as, identify the different areas of research and the most cited publication.\nA search of publications was performed in the Web of Science database for the period from 1977 to December 2021, using the term \"Artificial Intelligence AND (Ophthalmol* OR optometry)\". The analysis of the publication was carried out using the Citation Network Explorer, VOSviewer and CiteSpace software.\n1086 publications and 2348 citation networks were found. 2020 was the year with the highest number of publications, a total of 351 publications and 115 citation networks. The most cited publication was \"Clinically applicable deep learning for diagnosis and referral in retinal disease\" published by De Fauw et\u00a0al. in 2018, with a citation index of 723. Through the clustering function, three groups were found that cover the main research areas in this field: retinal pathology, anterior segment and glaucoma.\nThe citation network analysis offers an in-depth analysis of scientific publications and the adoption of new topics and fields of research. The results of an exhaustive analysis of citation networks in artificial intelligence in the field of ophthalmology and optometry are presented since the publication of the first article in 1977.", "In the edge intelligence environment, multiple sensing devices perceive and recognize the current scene in real time to provide specific user services. However, the generalizability of the fixed recognition model will gradually weaken due to the time-varying perception scene. To ensure the stability of the perception and recognition service, each edge model/agent needs to continuously learn from the new perception data unassisted to adapt to the perception environment changes and jointly build the online evolutive learning (OEL) system. The generalization degradation problem can be addressed by deploying the semi-supervised learning (SSL) method on multi-view agents and continuously tuning each discriminative model by collaborative perception. This paper proposes a multi-view agent's collaborative perception (MACP) semi-supervised online evolutive learning method. First, each view model will be initialized based on self-supervised learning methods, and each initialized model can learn differentiated feature-extraction patterns with certain discriminative independence. Then, through the discriminative information fusion of multi-view model predictions on the unlabeled perceptual data, reliable pseudo-labels are obtained for the consistency regularization process of SSL. Moreover, we introduce additional critical parameter constraints to continuously improve the discriminative independence of each view model during training. We compare our method with multiple representative multi-model and single-model SSL methods on various benchmarks. Experimental results show the superiority of the MACP in terms of convergence efficiency and performance. Meanwhile, we construct an ideal multi-view experiment to demonstrate the application potential of MACP in practical perception scenarios.", "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel disease that was identified during the COVID-19 pandemic and is characterised by systemic inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early detection of MIS-C is a challenge given its clinical similarities to Kawasaki disease and other acute febrile childhood illnesses. We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence algorithm that can distinguish among MIS-C, Kawasaki disease, and other similar febrile illnesses and aid in the diagnosis of patients in the emergency department and acute care setting.\nIn this retrospective model development and validation study, we developed a deep-learning algorithm called KIDMATCH (Kawasaki Disease vs Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children) using patient age, the five classic clinical Kawasaki disease signs, and 17 laboratory measurements. All features were prospectively collected at the time of initial evaluation from patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease or other febrile illness between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2019, at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego (CA, USA). For patients with MIS-C, the same data were collected from patients between May 7, 2020, and July 20, 2021, at Rady Children's Hospital, Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford (CT, USA), and Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CA, USA). We trained a two-stage model consisting of feedforward neural networks to distinguish between patients with MIS-C and those without and then those with Kawasaki disease and other febrile illnesses. After internally validating the algorithm using stratified tenfold cross-validation, we incorporated a conformal prediction framework to tag patients with erroneous data or distribution shifts. We finally externally validated KIDMATCH on patients with MIS-C enrolled between April 22, 2020, and July 21, 2021, from Boston Children's Hospital (MA, USA), Children's National Hospital (Washington, DC, USA), and the CHARMS Study Group consortium of 14 US hospitals.\n1517 patients diagnosed at Rady Children's Hospital between Jan 1, 2009, and June 7, 2021, with MIS-C (n=69), Kawasaki disease (n=775), or other febrile illnesses (n=673) were identified for internal validation, with an additional 16 patients with MIS-C included from Connecticut Children's Medical Center and 50 from Children's Hospital Los Angeles between May 7, 2020, and July 20, 2021. KIDMATCH achieved a median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve during internal validation of 98\u00b78% (IQR 98\u00b70-99\u00b73) in the first stage and 96\u00b70% (95\u00b76-97\u00b72) in the second stage. We externally validated KIDMATCH on 175 patients with MIS-C from Boston Children's Hospital (n=50), Children's National Hospital (n=42), and the CHARMS Study Group consortium of 14 US hospitals (n=83). External validation of KIDMATCH on patients with MIS-C correctly classified 76 of 81 patients (94% accuracy, two rejected by conformal prediction) from 14 hospitals in the CHARMS Study Group consortium, 47 of 49 patients (96% accuracy, one rejected by conformal prediction) from Boston Children's Hospital, and 36 of 40 patients (90% accuracy, two rejected by conformal prediction) from Children's National Hospital.\nKIDMATCH has the potential to aid front-line clinicians to distinguish between MIS-C, Kawasaki disease, and other similar febrile illnesses to allow prompt treatment and prevent severe complications.\nUS Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, US Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, US National Library of Medicine, the McCance Foundation, and the Gordon and Marilyn Macklin Foundation.", "In this study, we have compared 229 Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale - Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) cognitive profiles of different severity adults with autism spectrum disorder to verify the impact of several variables including sex, age, level of education and autism severity level in an Italian sample. Moreover, we wanted to find out the optimal cut points for the major intelligence quotients in order to discriminate autism severity levels.\nParticipants were recruited from two National Health System Center in two different Italian regions and were assessed with gold-standard instruments as a part of their clinical evaluation. According to DSM-5, cognitive domains were also measured with multi-componential tests. We used the Italian adaptation of WAIS-IV. We checked our hypotheses using linear regression models and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves.\nOur results showed that age and level of education have a strong impact on Verbal Comprehension (VCI) and Working Memory Indexes (WMI). Gender differences are relevant when considering the VCI and Processing Speed index (PSI) in which women obtained the best performance. These differences are still relevant when considering cut points of ROC because 69 resulted to be the optimal cut point for women, 65 for men.\nFew conclusions can be assumed only examining Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) scores as it includes many different information about broader cognitive abilities. Looking deeper at main indexes and their subtests findings are consistent with previous research on the disorder (moderate correlations of FSIQ, Perceptual Reasoning index, WMI and PSI with the participants' age), while other results are unforeseen (no effect of sex found on FSIQ score) or novel (significant effect of education on VCI and WMI). Using an algorithm predicting optimal cut point for discriminating through autism severity levels can help clinicians to better label and quantify the required help a person may need, a test cannot replace diagnostic and clinical evaluation by experienced clinicians.", "Due to the development and application of information technology, a series of modern information technologies represented by 5G, big data, and artificial intelligence are changing rapidly, and people's requirements for video coding standards have become higher. In the High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, the coding block division is not flexible enough, and the prediction mode is not detailed enough. A new generation of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standards was born. VVC inherits the hybrid coding framework adopted by HEVC, improves the original technology of each module, introduces a series of new coding technologies, and builds on this greatly improving the coding efficiency. Compared with HEVC, the block division structure of VVC has undergone great changes, retaining the quad-tree (QT) division method and increasing the multi-type tree (MTT) division method, which brings high coding complexity. To reduce the computational complexity of VVC coding block division, a fast decision algorithm for VVC intra-frame coding based on texture characteristics and machine learning is proposed. First, we analyze the characteristics of the CU partition structure decision and then use the texture complexity of the CU partition structure decision to terminate the CU partition process early; for CUs that do not meet the early termination of the partition, use the global sample information, local sample information, and context information. The three-category feature-trained tandem classifier framework predicts the division type of CU. The experimental results show that in the full intra mode, compared with the existing VTM10.0, the encoding output bit rate is increased by 1.36%, and the encoding time is saved by 52.63%.", "Attention is a complex cognitive process with innate resource management and information selection capabilities for maintaining a certain level of functional awareness in socio-cognitive service agents. The human-machine society depends on creating illusionary believable behaviors. These behaviors include processing sensory information based on contextual adaptation and focusing on specific aspects. The cognitive processes based on selective attention help the agent to efficiently utilize its computational resources by scheduling its intellectual tasks, which are not limited to decision-making, goal planning, action selection, and execution of actions. This study reports ongoing work on developing a cognitive architectural framework, a Nature-inspired Humanoid Cognitive Computing Platform for Self-aware and Conscious Agents (NiHA). The NiHA comprises cognitive theories, frameworks, and applications within machine consciousness (MC) and artificial general intelligence (AGI). The paper is focused on top-down and bottom-up attention mechanisms for service agents as a step towards machine consciousness. This study evaluates the behavioral impact of psychophysical states on attention. The proposed agent attains almost 90% accuracy in attention generation. In social interaction, contextual-based working is important, and the agent attains 89% accuracy in its attention by adding and checking the effect of psychophysical states on parallel selective attention. The addition of the emotions to attention process produced more contextual-based responses.", "Resource constraint Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) is controlled through gateway devices (e.g., smartphones, computers, etc.) that are connected to Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers or cloud regulated by a third party. Recently Machine Learning (ML) has been widely used in automation, consumer behavior analysis, device quality upgradation, etc. Typical ML predicts by analyzing customers' raw data in a centralized system which raises the security and privacy issues such as data leakage, privacy violation, single point of failure, etc. To overcome the problems, Federated Learning (FL) developed an initial solution to ensure services without sharing personal data. In FL, a centralized aggregator collaborates and makes an average for a global model used for the next round of training. However, the centralized aggregator raised the same issues, such as a single point of control leaking the updated model and interrupting the entire process. Additionally, research claims data can be retrieved from model parameters. Beyond that, since the Gateway (GW) device has full access to the raw data, it can also threaten the entire ecosystem. This research contributes a blockchain-controlled, edge intelligence federated learning framework for a distributed learning platform for CIoT. The federated learning platform allows collaborative learning with users' shared data, and the blockchain network replaces the centralized aggregator and ensures secure participation of gateway devices in the ecosystem. Furthermore, blockchain is trustless, immutable, and anonymous, encouraging CIoT end users to participate. We evaluated the framework and federated learning outcomes using the well-known Stanford Cars dataset. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework.", "Deciding the best action in social settings requires decision-makers to consider their and others' preferences, since the outcome depends on the actions of both. Numerous empirical investigations have demonstrated variability of behavior across individuals in strategic situations. While prosocial, moral, and emotional factors have been intensively investigated to explain this diversity, neuro-cognitive determinants of strategic decision-making and their relation with intelligence remain mostly unknown. This study presents a new model of the process of strategic decision-making in repeated interactions, first providing a precise measure of the environment's complexity, and then analyzing how this complexity affects subjects' performance and neural response. The results confirm the theoretical predictions of the model. The frequency of deviations from optimal behavior is explained by a combination of higher complexity of the strategic environment and cognitive skills of the individuals. Brain response correlates with strategic complexity, but only in the subgroups with higher cognitive skills. Furthermore, neural effects were only observed in a fronto-parietal network typically involved in single-agent tasks (the Multiple Demand Network), thus suggesting that neural processes dealing with cognitively demanding individual tasks also have a central role in interactive decision-making. Our findings contribute to understanding how cognitive factors shape strategic decision-making and may provide the neural pathway of the reported association between strategic sophistication and fluid intelligence.", "The world is entering an era that necessitates the deployment of new skills, specifically soft skills. Although teaching these skills is difficult because they involve fewer measurable elements, it is essential to rethink their integration into nursing education programs through innovative learning strategies.\nThis scoping review aimed to map the soft skill learning strategies implemented by nursing schools to incorporate these skills into nursing programs.\nStudies from 2010 to 2020 were retrieved from four major scientific databases: PUBMED, SCOPUS, SCIENCDIRECT, and WEB OF SCIENCE.\nRelevant to the present review were twelve studies that met the established inclusion criteria. Simulation-based learning strategies (n\u00a0=\u00a05), educational camp program on soft skills (n\u00a0=\u00a01), emotional intelligence model (n\u00a0=\u00a01), educational escape room learning strategy (n\u00a0=\u00a01), blended learning pedagogical tool (n\u00a0=\u00a01), debating as a learning strategy (n\u00a0=\u00a01), action learning (n\u00a0=\u00a01), and a course on grooming and etiquette (n\u00a0=\u00a01) were identified. Through data charting, twenty soft skills were identified. Communication, teamwork, critical thinking, confidence, and situational awareness were the top five developed by the implemented strategies.\nTeaching soft skills through practice has been shown to be effective in nursing education. This review can serve as a guide for nurse educators to conduct targeted soft skills training. However, developing a specific, unified framework for effectively integrating soft skills is essential, with ongoing assessment to support their successful implementation.", "The aim of this study is to describe and pilot a novel method for continuously identifying newly published trials relevant to a systematic review, enabled by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with human expertise.\nWe used RobotReviewer LIVE to keep a review of COVID-19 vaccination trials updated from February to August 2021. We compared the papers identified by the system with those found by the conventional manual process by the review team.\nThe manual update searches (last search date July 2021) retrieved 135 abstracts, of which 31 were included after screening (23% precision, 100% recall). By the same date, the automated system retrieved 56 abstracts, of which 31 were included after manual screening (55% precision, 100% recall). Key limitations of the system include that it is limited to searches of PubMed/MEDLINE, and considers only randomized controlled trial reports. We aim to address these limitations in future. The system is available as open-source software for further piloting and evaluation.\nOur system identified all relevant studies, reduced manual screening work, and enabled rolling updates on publication of new primary research.", "Adversarial machine learning (AML) is a class of data manipulation techniques that cause alterations in the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) systems while going unnoticed by humans. These alterations can cause serious vulnerabilities to mission-critical AI-enabled applications. This work introduces an AI architecture augmented with adversarial examples and defense algorithms to safeguard, secure, and make more reliable AI systems. This can be conducted by robustifying deep neural network (DNN) classifiers and explicitly focusing on the specific case of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in non-trivial manufacturing environments prone to noise, vibrations, and errors when capturing and transferring data. The proposed architecture enables the imitation of the interplay between the attacker and a defender based on the deployment and cross-evaluation of adversarial and defense strategies. The AI architecture enables (i) the creation and usage of adversarial examples in the training process, which robustify the accuracy of CNNs, (ii) the evaluation of defense algorithms to recover the classifiers' accuracy, and (iii) the provision of a multiclass discriminator to distinguish and report on non-attacked and attacked data. The experimental results show promising results in a hybrid solution combining the defense algorithms and the multiclass discriminator in an effort to revitalize the attacked base models and robustify the DNN classifiers. The proposed architecture is ratified in the context of a real manufacturing environment utilizing datasets stemming from the actual production lines.", "Sensorineural hearing loss (presbycusis) affects up to half of the adults, is associated with cognitive decline. Whether this association reflects the cause, the consequence, or parallel processes driven by other factors remains unclear. Both presbycusis and cognition are linked to elevated metabolic risk, which in turn raises with age.\nIn a multioccasion longitudinal design, we used latent change score models with strong factorial invariance to assess the change in pure-tone threshold auditory function, fluid intelligence, metabolic risk, variability therein, and the dynamic relationships among the 3 domains. We examined, up to 4 times over more than 7 years, a sample of relatively healthy 687 adults (aged 18.17-83.25 years).\nWe found that levels of auditory and cognitive functioning at time t-1 influence each other's subsequent change between times t-1 and t, even when controlling for the reciprocal effects of metabolic risk on both. Thus, auditory and cognitive functioning do not only decline in parallel in healthy adults, but also affect each other's trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first long-term study with such evidence.\nOur results are in accord with extant hypotheses about auditory-cognitive associations in old age (e.g., social isolation, cognitive load, increased inflammation, reduced gene expression, and other microvascular or neuropathological factors). They also echo previous reports underscoring the need for improving access to hearing aids and other rehabilitative services aimed at reducing hearing loss. If applied early in the aging process, such interventions may mitigate cognitive decline.", "Prognostic assessment of local therapies for colorectal liver metastases (CLM) is essential for guiding management in radiation oncology. Computed tomography (CT) contains liver texture information which may be predictive of metastatic environments. To investigate the feasibility of analyzing CT texture, we sought to build an automated model to predict progression-free survival using CT radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI).\nLiver CT scans and outcomes for N\u00a0=\u00a097 CLM patients treated with radiotherapy were retrospectively obtained. A survival model was built by extracting 108 radiomic features from liver and tumor CT volumes for a random survival forest (RSF) to predict local progression. Accuracies were measured by concordance indices (C-index) and integrated Brier scores (IBS) with 4-fold cross-validation. This was repeated with different liver segmentations and radiotherapy clinical variables as inputs to the RSF. Predictive features were identified by perturbation importances.\nThe AI radiomics model achieved a C-index of 0.68 (CI: 0.62-0.74) and IBS below 0.25 and the most predictive radiomic feature was gray tone difference matrix strength (importance: 1.90 CI: 0.93-2.86) and most predictive treatment feature was maximum dose (importance: 3.83, CI: 1.05-6.62). The clinical data only model achieved a similar C-index of 0.62 (CI: 0.56-0.69), suggesting that predictive signals exist in radiomics and clinical data.\nThe AI model achieved good prediction accuracy for progression-free survival of CLM, providing support that radiomics or clinical data combined with machine learning may aid prognostic assessment and management.", "The unnatural amino acid (UAA) incorporation technique through genetic code expansion has been extensively used in protein engineering for the last two decades. Mutations into UAAs offer more dimensions to tune protein structures and functions. However, the huge library of optional UAAs and various circumstances of mutation sites on different proteins urge rational UAA incorporations guided by artificial intelligence. Here we collected existing experimental proofs of UAA-incorporated proteins in literature and established a database of known UAA substitution sites. By program designing and machine learning on the database, we showed that UAA incorporations into proteins are predictable by the observed evolutional, steric and physiochemical factors. Based on the predicted probability of successful UAA substitutions, we tested the model performance using literature-reported and freshly-designed experimental proofs, and demonstrated its potential in screening UAA-incorporated proteins. This work expands structure-based computational biology and virtual screening to UAA-incorporated proteins, and offers a useful tool to automate the rational design of proteins with any UAA."],
