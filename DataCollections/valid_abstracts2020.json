{"abstracts": ["Objective: The incidence of breast cancer in Chinese women continues to rise. The large breast cancer cohort studies in China are relatively scarce. There are many bottlenecks in the construction of large clinical cohort for breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognoses, such as inconsistent standards, high rates of lost follow-up, repeated construction, and inability to share. To better solving the difficulties and problems faced by large-scale clinical cohort research in China, this project will cooperate with several tertiary A hospitals to establish a breast cancer cohort in Chinese women. It also provides a data platform and technical support for breast cancer multi-center clinical cohort research. Methods: Based on the evidence-based medicine and expert opinion and consensus, we established a breast cancer cohort standardized indicator set-recording baseline information, diagnosis and treatment-related information of the enrolled patients, and collecting biological specimens. According to the technical specification of long-term follow-up for the endpoint, data management, and data security and in the large population-based cohort study, a standardized follow-up system for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of breast cancer prospective cohorts is formed. Results: Based on standardized data sets and the computer discipline's advantage from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, we integrate the new information technology methods, including dynamic information collection terminals and social networks. Thus, the quality of control programs on compliance and intelligence data was improved, and a Chinese women breast cancer cohort database was developed. By February 2020, 12 147 patients were included in the clinical cohort database. Biological specimens'resources in cohort construction were collected and cooperated with Shandong University to research the multi-center quality control system and shared evaluation system of biobanks. Building an open and shared biobank network and forming a full chain of breast cancer research platform. Conclusion: With the implementation of the \"13(th) Five-Year Plan\" precision medicine research, this study provides a research foundation for precision diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and provides data support for the country to formulate relevant medical policies.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u4e2d\u56fd\u5973\u6027\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u6301\u7eed\u5347\u9ad8\uff0c\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\u3002\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u8bca\u7597\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u9884\u540e\u7814\u7a76\u5fc5\u9700\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u961f\u5217\u5efa\u8bbe\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u56fd\u5185\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u5927\u578b\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u532e\u4e4f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u5931\u8bbf\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u5efa\u8bbe\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u5171\u4eab\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u8bfe\u9898\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u6211\u56fd\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u578b\u4e34\u5e8a\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u591a\u5bb6\u4e09\u7ea7\u7532\u7b49\u533b\u9662\uff0c\u5408\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u4e13\u75c5\u961f\u5217\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e34\u5e8a\u961f\u5217\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u4e73\u817a\u764c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u961f\u5217\u4e13\u75c5\u961f\u5217\u7684\u5efa\u7acb\u4ee5\u5faa\u8bc1\u533b\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bba\u8bc1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u961f\u5217\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5165\u7ec4\u6307\u6807\u96c6\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5165\u7ec4\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8bca\u7597\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u91c7\u96c6\u751f\u7269\u6807\u672c\u3002\u6839\u636e\u5927\u578b\u4eba\u7fa4\u961f\u5217\u7ec8\u70b9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u957f\u671f\u968f\u8bbf\u6280\u672f\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5b89\u5168\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u961f\u5217\u7684\u8bca\u7597\u53ca\u9884\u540e\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u968f\u8bbf\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5317\u4eac\u79d1\u6280\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5b66\u79d1\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u91c7\u96c6\u7ec8\u7aef\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u65b0\u5174\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u6539\u5584\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u53ca\u667a\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7814\u53d1\u51fa\u4e86\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u4e13\u75c5\u961f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u622a\u81f32020\u5e742\u6708\u4e34\u5e8a\u961f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u60a3\u800512 147\u540d\u3002\u961f\u5217\u5efa\u8bbe\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u91c7\u96c6\u6837\u672c\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5c71\u4e1c\u5927\u5b66\u7275\u5934\u5f00\u5c55\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6837\u672c\u5e93\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u4f53\u7cfb\u53ca\u5171\u4eab\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f53\u7cfb\u7814\u7a76\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6837\u672c\u5e93\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u53d1\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\u5168\u94fe\u6761\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5e73\u53f0\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u672c\u7814\u7a76\u968f\u7740\"\u5341\u4e09\u4e94\"\u89c4\u5212\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bca\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5236\u5b9a\u76f8\u5173\u533b\u5b66\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002.", "To determine the optimal quantity of learning data needed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) that can automatically identify cephalometric landmarks.\nA total of 2400 cephalograms were collected, and 80 landmarks were manually identified by a human examiner. Of these, 2200 images were chosen as the learning data to train AI. The remaining 200 images were used as the test data. A total of 24 combinations of the quantity of learning data (50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 2000) were selected by the random sampling method without replacement, and the number of detecting targets per image (19, 40, and 80) were used in the AI training procedures. The training procedures were repeated four times. A total of 96 different AIs were produced. The accuracy of each AI was evaluated in terms of radial error.\nThe accuracy of AI increased linearly with the increasing number of learning data sets on a logarithmic scale. It decreased with increasing numbers of detection targets. To estimate the optimal quantity of learning data, a prediction model was built. At least 2300 sets of learning data appeared to be necessary to develop AI as accurate as human examiners.\nA considerably large quantity of learning data was necessary to develop accurate AI.

This procedure can been improved by means of feedback control strategies of a secondary variable, which can be measured and controlled. Its main advantage is a new form of dynamic response, with improvements in the response time of the measurement of the quantity of interest. In water pumping networks, this methodology can be employed for measuring the flow indirectly, which can be advantageous due to the high price of flow sensors and the operational complexity to install them in pipelines. In this work, we present the use of artificial intelligence techniques in the implementation of the feedback system for indirect flow measurement. Among the contributions of this new technique is the design of the pressure controller using the Fuzzy logic theory, which rules out the need for knowing the plant model, as well as the use of an artificial neural network for the construction of nonlinear models with the purpose of indirectly estimating the flow. The validation of the proposed approach was carried out through experimental tests in a water pumping system, fully automated and installed at the Laboratory of Hydraulic and Energy Efficiency in Sanitation at the Federal University of Paraiba (LENHS/UFPB). The results were compared with an electromagnetic flow sensor present in the system, obtaining a maximum relative error of 10%.", "Transfer of learning or leveraging a pre-trained network and fine-tuning it to perform new tasks has been successfully applied in a variety of machine intelligence fields, including computer vision, natural language processing and audio/speech recognition. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience research that suggests that both visual and tactile stimuli rouse similar neural networks in the human brain, in this work, we explore the idea of transferring learning from vision to touch in the context of 3D object recognition. In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) pre-trained on visual images are adapted and evaluated for the classification of tactile data sets. To do so, we ran experiments with five different pre-trained CNN architectures and on five different datasets acquired with different technologies of tactile sensors including BathTip, Gelsight, force-sensing resistor (FSR) array, a high-resolution virtual FSR sensor, and tactile sensors on the Barrett robotic hand. The results obtained confirm the transferability of learning from vision to touch to interpret 3D models. Due to its higher resolution, tactile data from optical tactile sensors was demonstrated to achieve higher classification rates based on visual features compared to other technologies relying on pressure measurements. Further analysis of the weight updates in the convolutional layer is performed to measure the similarity between visual and tactile features for each technology of tactile sensing. Comparing the weight updates in different convolutional layers suggests that by updating a few convolutional layers of a pre-trained CNN on visual data, it can be efficiently used to classify tactile data. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid architecture performing both visual and tactile 3D object recognition with a MobileNetV2 backbone. MobileNetV2 is chosen due to its smaller size and thus its capability to be implemented on mobile devices, such that the network can classify both visual and tactile data. An accuracy of 100% for visual and 77.63% for tactile data are achieved by the proposed architecture.", "To explore the value of artificial intelligence combined with multi-parametric MRI (AI-mpMRI) in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.\nThis retrospective study included 64 cases of prostate cancer confirmed by biopsy and treated by radical prostatectomy from May 2017 to February 2018. The mpMRI images of T2 weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic-contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI and the pathological sections corresponding to the three sequential MRI images were collected. The benign and malignant regions were labeled on the pathological slice level, the three sequential MRI axial images at the same level were virtually covered with the pathological slice using computer-aided transparent mapping technology, and selected the fixed-sized benign and malignant regions of interest (ROI). The MATLAB software was used to display the features of the images and screen out the characteristic parameters with P < 0.05, so as to derive high-accuracy analytical methods for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.\nA total of 31 image characteristics were extracted with the MATLAB software, and 3 high-accuracy analytical methods screened out for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, including the linear discrimination, logistic regression analysis, and support vector machine classification, with the accuracy rates of 75.9%, 75.4% and 74.9% and the areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.83, 0.82 and 0.82, respectively.\nAI-mpMRI can achieve a high detection rate in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer and therefore has a high clinical application value.", "Dual-energy CT (DECT) overcomes several limitations of conventional single-energy CT (SECT) for the evaluation of gastrointestinal diseases. This article provides an overview of practical aspects of the DECT technology and acquisition protocols, reviews existing clinical applications, discusses current challenges, and describes future directions, with a focus on gastrointestinal imaging. A head-to-head comparison of technical specifications among DECT scanner implementations is provided. Energy- and material-specific DECT image reconstructions enable retrospective (i.e., after examination acquisition) image quality adjustments that are not possible using SECT. Such adjustments may, for example, correct insufficient contrast bolus or metal artifacts, thereby potentially avoiding patient recalls. A combination of low-energy monochromatic images, iodine maps, and virtual unenhanced images can be included in protocols to improve lesion detection and disease characterization. Relevant literature is reviewed regarding use of DECT for evaluation of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and bowel. Challenges involving cost, workflow, body habitus, and variability in DECT measurements are considered. Artificial intelligence and machine-learning image reconstruction algorithms, PACS integration, photon-counting hardware, and novel contrast agents are expected to expand the multienergy capability of DECT and further augment its value.", "Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective treatment for severe osteoarthritis. Despite good survival rates, up to 20% of TKA patients remain dissatisfied. Recently, promising new technologies have been developed in knee arthroplasty, and could improve the functional outcomes. The aim of this paper was to present some new technologies in TKA, their current concepts, their advantages, and limitations. The patient-specific instrumentations can allow an improvement of implant positioning and limb alignment, but no difference is found for functional outcomes. The customized implants are conceived to reproduce the native knee anatomy and to reproduce its biomechanics. The sensors have to aim to give objective data on ligaments balancing during TKA. Few studies are published on the results at mid-term of these two devices currently. The accelerometers are smart tools developed to improve the TKA alignment. Their benefits remain yet controversial. The robotic-assisted systems allow an accurate and reproducible bone preparation due to a robotic interface, with a 3D surgical planning, based on preoperative 3D imaging or not. This promising system, nevertheless, has some limits. The new technologies in TKA are very attractive and have constantly evolved. Nevertheless, some limitations persist and could be improved by artificial intelligence and predictive modeling.", "This study assessed the co-occurrence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in newly diagnosed adults of normal intelligence and the contribution of trait-based dimensions deriving from the Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale-IV (BAARS-IV), the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), and the Empathy Quotient (EQ) to the differentiation of patients with ADHD, ASD, and ADHD/ASD. A total of 16.1% of patients with ADHD received a co-occurring ASD diagnosis, while 33.3% of patients with ASD received an ADHD diagnosis. Subjects with ADHD or ADHD/ASD had higher scores in all ADHD traits compared to ASD subjects. Compared to the ADHD group, the ASD group had AQ scores that were significantly greater, except for attention to detail. ADHD/ASD co-occurrence significantly increased the score of attention to detail. The total EQ score was greater in the ADHD group. In the stepwise logistic regression analyses, past hyperactivity, current inattention and impulsivity, attention switching, communication, imagination, and total EQ score discriminated ADHD patients from ASD patients. Attention to detail, imagination, and total EQ score discriminated ADHD cases from ADHD/ASD cases, while past hyperactivity and current impulsivity discriminated ASD subjects from ADHD/ASD subjects. Our findings highlight the importance of particular trait-based dimensions when discriminating adults with ADHD, ASD, and co-occurring ADHD/ASD.", "Socioeconomic reasons post-COVID-19 demand unsupervised home-based rehabilitation and, specifically, artificial ambient intelligence with individualisation to support engagement and motivation. Artificial intelligence must also comply with accountability, responsibility, and transparency (ART) requirements for wider acceptability. This paper presents such a patient-centric individualised home-based rehabilitation support system. To this end, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Five Time Sit To Stand (FTSTS) tests evaluate daily living activity performance in the presence or development of comorbidities. We present a method for generating synthetic datasets complementing experimental observations and mitigating bias. We present an incremental hybrid machine learning algorithm combining ensemble learning and hybrid stacking using extreme gradient boosted decision trees and k-nearest neighbours to meet individualisation, interpretability, and ART design requirements while maintaining low computation footprint. The model reaches up to 100% accuracy for both FTSTS and TUG in predicting associated patient medical condition, and 100% or 83.13%, respectively, in predicting area of difficulty in the segments of the test. Our results show an improvement of 5% and 15% for FTSTS and TUG tests, respectively, over previous approaches that use intrusive means of monitoring such as cameras.", "Artificial intelligence methods may help in unveiling information that is hidden in high-dimensional oncological data. Flow cytometry studies of haematological malignancies provide quantitative data with the potential to be used for the construction of response biomarkers. Many computational methods from the bioinformatics toolbox can be applied to these data, but they have not been exploited in their full potential in leukaemias, specifically for the case of childhood B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. In this paper, we analysed flow cytometry data that were obtained at diagnosis from 56 paediatric B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia patients from two local institutions. Our aim was to assess the prognostic potential of immunophenotypical marker expression intensity. We constructed classifiers that are based on the Fisher's Ratio to quantify differences between patients with relapsing and non-relapsing disease. We also correlated this with genetic information. The main result that arises from the data was the association between subexpression of marker CD38 and the probability of relapse.", "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to its widespread industrial adoption, with machine learning systems demonstrating superhuman performance in a significant number of tasks. However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into \"black box\" approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.", "One of the biggest challenges of activity data collection is the need to rely on users and keep them engaged to continually provide labels. Recent breakthroughs in mobile platforms have proven effective in bringing deep neural networks powered intelligence into mobile devices. This study proposes a novel on-device personalization for data labeling for an activity recognition system using mobile sensing. The key idea behind this system is that estimated activities personalized for a specific individual user can be used as feedback to motivate user contribution and improve data labeling quality. First, we exploited fine-tuning using a Deep Recurrent Neural Network to address the lack of sufficient training data and minimize the need for training deep learning on mobile devices from scratch. Second, we utilized a model pruning technique to reduce the computation cost of on-device personalization without affecting the accuracy. Finally, we built a robust activity data labeling system by integrating the two techniques outlined above, allowing the mobile application to create a personalized experience for the user. To demonstrate the proposed model's capability and feasibility, we developed and deployed the proposed system to realistic settings. For our experimental setup, we gathered more than 16,800 activity windows from 12 activity classes using smartphone sensors. We empirically evaluated the proposed quality by comparing it with a baseline using machine learning. Our results indicate that the proposed system effectively improved activity accuracy recognition for individual users and reduced cost and latency for inference for mobile devices. Based on our findings, we highlight critical and promising future research directions regarding the design of efficient activity data collection with on-device personalization.", "Technological advances and the evolution of mobile technologies enable patients to meet their doctors through their smartphones. While offering the opportunity of digital visits to patients, there are also challenges for this development. The purpose of this study is to enhance the understanding of digital visits, as perceived by experts working in telemedicine companies. To serve this purpose, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with managers and employees in eight telemedicine companies. The analysis of the empirical data confirmed the importance of digital visits and their efficiency. The potential of digital visits is expected to increase significantly, should they make use of remote devices to transfer real-time data from patients to physicians. In such a case, digital visits are expected to cover approximately 70-75% of medical cases. However, the use of remote devices must be taken with caution and specific conditions need to be taken into account. We encourage researchers to perform research on promising technologies such as artificial intelligence and remote diagnostic devices, which could make more diagnoses and conditions possible to be treated by digital visits. This is even more important in light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.", "In the era of artificial intelligence, big data and 5G, health care for elderly people is facing an important digital transformation. The objective of this study is to design the data analysis module of the elderly health service monitoring system (HSMS) and attempt to put forward a new healthy aging (HA) model that is applicable not only to the individual HA, but also to the regional HA system. Based on the HA theory of collaborative governance, we divided the elderly HSMS into four modules, including physical health, mental health, ability of daily activity, and social participation. Then, factors that influence HA were assessed by stepwise logistic regression to build the analysis model, using the public micro-panel data of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS). Age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-2.27)), living in urban areas (OR = 1.57 (95% CI: 1.03-2.39)), being literate (OR = 1.51 (95% CI: 1.01-2.23)), expecting to get long-term health care in the future from their grown children (OR = 1.69 (95% CI: 1.10-2.61)) and having literate grown children (OR = 2.01 (95% CI: 0.26-0.97)) had a significant positive impact on HA of elderly people. Therefore, the F-W (factors and weighs, also family and welfare) model is proposed in this paper. The outcomes can contribute with designing HSMS for different provinces and several different regions in China and leave a door open to improve the model and algorithm application for HSMS in the future studies.", "(1) Background: Family is considered as one of the most important elements for the transmission of healthy habits that improve the lives of students. For this reason, the present study aims to describe the degree of family functionality, emotional intelligence, Mediterranean diet adherence, and extra-curricular physical activity engagement. A further aim is to perform a correlational analysis between these variables. (2) Methods: To this end, an ad hoc questionnaire was used, alongside the APGAR, KIDMED, and Trait Meta Mood Scale (TMMS-24). (3) Results: Finally, the data suggest that a high percentage of students need to improve their diet. Further, students reporting severe family dysfunction showed worse outcomes. Thus, levels of emotional clarity were lower when family functionality was poor. Poor diet quality was also associated with lower emotional attention, with Mediterranean diet adherence being positively related to emotional clarity and repair, as well as normal family functionality. (4) Conclusions: Boys showed higher levels of adherence to the Mediterranean diet adherence, while girls reported higher family functionality. Thus, compliance with the minimum recommendations for physical activity engagement was associated with adequate adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The importance of diet for obtaining an optimal physical condition, adequate emotional state, and family functionality is highlighted.", "For ensuring the safety and reliability of high-speed trains, fault diagnosis (FD) technique plays an important role. Benefiting from the rapid developments of artificial intelligence, intelligent FD (IFD) strategies have obtained much attention in the field of academics and applications, where the qualitative approach is an important branch. Therefore, this survey will present a comprehensive review of these qualitative approaches from both theoretical and practical aspects. The primary task of this paper is to review the current development of these qualitative IFD techniques and then to present some of the latest results. Another major focus of our research is to introduce the background of high-speed trains, like the composition of the core subsystems, system structure, etc., based on which it becomes convenient for researchers to extract the diagnostic knowledge of high-speed trains, where the purpose is to understand how to use these types of knowledge. By reasonable utilization of the knowledge, it is hopeful to address various challenges caused by the coupling among subsystems of high-speed trains. Furthermore, future research trends for qualitative IFD approaches are also presented.", "Personal activity intelligence (PAI) is a metric developed to simplify a physically active lifestyle for the participants. Regardless of following today's advice for physical activity, a PAI score \u2265100 per week at baseline, an increase in PAI score, and a sustained high PAI score over time were found to delay premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in a large population of Norwegians. However, the association between long-term temporal change in PAI and mortality in other populations have not been investigated.\nTo test whether temporal change in PAI is associated with CVD and all-cause mortality in a large population from the United States.\nWe studied 17,613 relatively healthy participants who received at least two medical examinations in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study between 1974 and 2002. The participant's weekly PAI scores were estimated twice, and adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CVD and all-cause mortality related to changes in PAI between baseline and last examination were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses.\nDuring a median follow-up time of 9.3\u00a0years [interquartile range, 2.6-16.6; 181,765 person-years], there were 1144 deaths, including 400 CVD deaths. We observed an inverse linear association between change in PAI and risk of CVD mortality (P=0.007 for linear trend, and P=0.35 for quadratic trend). Compared to participants with zero PAI at both examinations, multivariable-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants who maintained high PAI scores (\u2265100 PAI at both examinations) had a 51% reduced risk of CVD mortality [AHR, 0.49: 95% CI, 0.26-0.95)], and 42% reduced risk of all-cause mortality [AHR, 0.58: 95% CI, 0.41-0.83)]. For participants who increased their PAI scores over time (PAI score of zero at first examination and \u2265100 at last examination), the AHRs were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.55-1.02) for CVD mortality, and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69-0.99) for all-cause mortality. Participants who maintained high PAI score had 4.8 (95% CI, 3.3-6.4) years of life gained. For those who increased their PAI score over time, the corresponding years gained were 1.8\u00a0years (95% CI, 0.1-3.5).\nAmong relatively healthy participants, an increase in PAI and maintaining a high PAI score over time was associated with reduced risk of CVD and all-cause mortality.\nOur objective was to investigate the association between temporal changes in PAI and mortality in a large population from the United States. In this prospective cohort study of 17,613 relatively healthy participants at baseline, maintaining a high PAI score and an increase in PAI score over an average period of 6.3\u00a0years was associated with a significant reduction in CVD and all-cause mortality. Based on our results, clinicians can easily recommend that patients obtain at least 100 PAI for most favourable protection against CVD- and all-cause mortality, but can also mention that significant benefits also occur at maintaining low-to-moderate PAI levels.", "Total Kidney Volume (TKV) is essential for analyzing the progressive loss of renal function in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). Conventionally, to measure TKV from medical images, a radiologist needs to localize and segment the kidneys by defining and delineating the kidney's boundary slice by slice. However, kidney localization is a time-consuming and challenging task considering the unstructured medical images from big data such as Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CCT). This study aimed to design an automatic localization model of ADPKD using Artificial Intelligence. A robust detection model using CCT images, image preprocessing, and Single Shot Detector (SSD) Inception V2 Deep Learning (DL) model is designed here. The model is trained and evaluated with 110 CCT images that comprise 10,078 slices. The experimental results showed that our derived detection model outperformed other DL detectors in terms of Average Precision (AP) and mean Average Precision (mAP). We achieved mAP = 94% for image-wise testing and mAP = 82% for subject-wise testing, when threshold on Intersection over Union (IoU) = 0.5. This study proves that our derived automatic detection model can assist radiologist in locating and classifying the ADPKD kidneys precisely and rapidly in order to improve the segmentation task and TKV calculation.", "Increasing the students' academic achievement in the international evaluation arena is a challenge for our country, and cooperative learning and emotional intelligence may be a solution for this problem. The link between cooperative learning, emotional intelligence, and academic achievement has been poorly studied so far. The objective of the present investigation was to examine the influence of cooperative learning on trait emotional intelligence and academic achievement. The methodology used was a quasi-experimental design with pre/post-measurements and experimental/control groups. The participants were primary education students (n\u00a0=\u00a0692) and teachers (n\u00a0=\u00a024) from eight public schools in Madrid, Spain. The instruments used were the Emotional Quotient-Youth Version questionnaire and internal and external assessment tests. Our\u00a0results\u00a0indicated\u00a0that cooperative learning improved scores of one dimension of trait emotional intelligence, change adaptability, and students' academic achievement (Mathematics and Spanish Language). We discussed the possible implications of these outcomes for educational practice.", "Objective: To apply artificial intelligence technology in clinical real-world data of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, explore the precise treatment of disease and build up artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support system. Methods: A total of 5 642 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma admitted to West China Hospital from July 2004 to June 2016 with complete follow-up records were included in the study. A merged model composed of multiple sub-classifiers was adopted to calculate therapy recommendation coefficient, and receiver operator characteristic curve was analyzed. Survival risk and recurrence risk were predicted by DeepSurv algorithm, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were further compared among low, middle and high risk groups. Siamese-Net was applied to find similar patients. Results: The Top-1 and Top-2 accuracy of therapy recommendation coefficient reached 82.36% and 94.13% respectively. In internal verification of West China Hospital, the above-mentioned value reached 95.10% in accordance with multi-disciplinary team results. The C-index derived from survival risk model was 0.735 (95%CI:0.70-0.77), and the difference of Kaplan-Meier in pairwise comparison was of statistical significance under log-rank test (P<0.001). Meanwhile, the C-index derived from recurrence risk model was 0.705 (95%CI:0.68-0.73), and the difference of Kaplan-Meier in pairwise comparison was of statistical significance under log-rank test (P<0.001). Conclusions: The artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support system for primary hepatocellular carcinoma has can accurately make therapy recommendation and prognosis prediction for primary hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u5c06\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u539f\u53d1\u6027\u809d\u7ec6\u80de\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u809d\u764c\u7cbe\u51c6\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u809d\u764c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u5c062004\u5e747\u6708\u81f32016\u5e746\u6708\u95f4\u534e\u897f\u533b\u9662\u6536\u6cbb\u4e14\u6709\u5b8c\u6574\u968f\u8bbf\u8bb0\u5f55\u76845 642\u4f8b\u539f\u53d1\u6027\u809d\u764c\u60a3\u8005\u7eb3\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5de5\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81\u66f2\u7ebf\uff1b\u91c7\u7528DeepSurv\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u590d\u53d1\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u7ec4\u3001\u4e2d\u98ce\u9669\u7ec4\u548c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7ec4\u95f4\u7684Kaplan-Meier\u751f\u5b58\u66f2\u7ebf\uff1b\u5229\u7528Siamese-Net\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u75c5\u4f8b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u6570\u7684Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cTop-2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a82.36%\u548c94.13%\uff1b\u5728\u534e\u897f\u533b\u9662\u5185\u90e8\u4f7f\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u4f1a\u8bca\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe95.10%\u3002\u751f\u5b58\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5230\u7684C-index\u503c\u4e3a0.735\uff0895%CI\uff1a0.70~0.77\uff09\uff0c\u5404\u98ce\u9669\u7ec4\u7684Kaplan-Meier\u66f2\u7ebf\u7ecflog-rank\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u5404\u7ec4\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P<0.001\uff09\u3002\u590d\u53d1\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5230\u7684C-index\u503c\u4e3a0.705\uff0895%CI\uff1a0.68~0.73\uff09\uff0c\u5404\u98ce\u9669\u7ec4\u7684Kaplan-Meier\u66f2\u7ebf\u7ecflog-rank\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u5404\u7ec4\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08P<0.001\uff09\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u809d\u764c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8f83\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u53d1\u6027\u809d\u7ec6\u80de\u764c\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002.", "Depression is more common among older adults, but there is a paucity of information about its association with spiritual intelligence. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and association of depressive symptoms with spiritual intelligence among older adults.\nThis community-based cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 292 older adults in a rural area of Puducherry, India. A structured questionnaire was used to collect each participant's socio-demographic and behavioral factors; the presence of depressive symptoms was assessed by using Geriatric Depression Scale (short form), spiritual intelligence by the Spiritual Intelligence Self-Report Inventory-24 questionnaire and activities of daily living by Katz Index of Independence scale. Proportion for prevalence estimate, bivariate and multivariable log binomial regression analysis were done.\nThe prevalence of depressive symptoms was 64.1 % (187/292; 95 % CI 58.3-69.3). Of total, 103 (35.3 %) had low, 92 (31.55 %) had moderate and 97 (33.2 %) had high spiritual intelligence. About 11 % (32/292) were partially or fully dependent. Depressive symptoms showed a significant association with marital status, education, sleep pattern, relationship with family members and spiritual intelligence in bivariate analysis. Depressive symptoms were high among those with low spiritual intelligence and disturbed sleep pattern with Adjusted Prevalence Ratio of 1.33 (95 %CI 1.26-1.4) and 1.06 (95 %CI 1.0-1.14) respectively.\nMajority of the older adults had depressive symptoms and significantly more among those with low spiritual intelligence and disturbed sleep. This study gives new evidence on spiritual intelligence among older adults in a community setting and the magnitude of association of depressive symptoms with spiritual intelligence.", "This study aims to evaluate the performance of four artificial intelligence-aided diagnostic systems in identifying and measuring four types of pulmonary nodules.\nFour types of nodules were implanted in a commercial lung phantom. The phantom was scanned with multislice spiral computed tomography, after which four systems (A, B, C, D) were used to identify the nodules and measure their volumes.\nThe relative volume error (RVE) of system A was the lowest for all nodules, except for small ground glass nodules (SGGNs). System C had the smallest RVE for SGGNs, -0.13 (-0.56, 0.00). In the Bland-Altman test, only systems A and C passed the consistency test, P\u00a0=\u00a00.40. In terms of precision, the miss rate (MR) of system C was 0.00% for small solid nodules (SSNs), ground glass nodules (GGNs), and solid nodules (SNs) but 4.17% for SGGNs. The comparable system D MRs for SGGNs, SSNs, and GGNs were 71.30%, 25.93%, and 47.22%, respectively, the highest among all the systems. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that system A had the best performance in recognizing SSNs and GGNs, with areas under the curve of 0.91 and 0.68. System C had the best performance for SGGNs (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.91).\nAmong four types nodules, SGGNs are the most difficult to recognize, indicating the need to improve higher accuracy and precision of artificial systems. System A most accurately measured nodule volume. System C was most precise in recognizing all four types of nodules, especially SGGN.", "Most women with early stage endometrial cancer have a favorable prognosis. However, there is a subset of patients who develop recurrence. In addition to the pathological stage, clinical and therapeutic factors affect the probability of recurrence. Machine learning is a subtype of artificial intelligence that is considered effective for predictive tasks. We tried to predict recurrence in early stage endometrial cancer using machine learning methods based on clinical data.\nWe enrolled 75 patients with early stage endometrial cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I or II) who had received surgical treatment at our institute. A total of 5 machine learning classifiers were used, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), and boosted tree, to predict the recurrence based on 16 parameters (age, body mass index, gravity/parity, hypertension/diabetic, stage, histological type, grade, surgical content and adjuvant chemotherapy). We analyzed the classification accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC).\nThe highest accuracy was 0.82 for SVM, followed by 0.77 for RF, 0.74 for LR, 0.66 for DT, and 0.66 for boosted trees. The highest AUC was 0.53 for LR, followed by 0.52 for boosted trees, 0.48 for DT, and 0.47 for RF. Therefore, the best predictive model for this analysis was LR.\nThe performance of the machine learning classifiers was not optimal owing to the small size of the dataset. The use of a machine learning model made it possible to predict recurrence in early stage endometrial cancer.", "Digital tissue image analysis is a computational method for analyzing whole-slide images and extracting large, complex, and quantitative data sets. However, as with any analysis method, the quality of generated results is dependent on a well-designed quality control system for the entire digital pathology workflow. Such system requires clear procedural controls, appropriate user training, and involvement of specialists to oversee key steps of the workflow. The toxicologic pathologist is responsible for reporting data obtained by digital image analysis and therefore needs to ensure that it is correct. To accomplish that, they must understand the main parameters of the quality control system and should play an integral part in its conception and implementation. This manuscript describes the most common digital tissue image analysis end points and potential sources of analysis errors. In addition, it outlines recommended approaches for ensuring quality and correctness of results for both classical and machine-learning based image analysis solutions, as adapted from a recently proposed Food and Drug Administration regulatory framework for modifications to artificial intelligence/machine learning-based software as a medical device. These approaches are beneficial for any type of toxicopathologic study which uses the described end points and can be adjusted based on the intended use of the image analysis solution.", "With the recent development of artificial intelligence along with information and communications infrastructure, a new paradigm of online services is being developed. Whereas in the past a service system could only exchange information of the service provider at the request of the user, information can now be provided by automatically analyzing a particular need, even without a direct user request. This also holds for online platforms of used-vehicle sales. In the past, consumers needed to inconveniently determine and classify the quality of information through static data provided by service and information providers. As a result, this service field has been harmful to consumers owing to such problems as false sales, fraud, and exaggerated advertising. Despite significant efforts of platform providers, there are limited human resources for censoring the vast amounts of data uploaded by sellers. Therefore, in this study, an algorithm called YOLOv3+MSSIM Type 2 for automatically censoring the data of used-vehicle sales on an online platform was developed. To this end, an artificial intelligence system that can automatically analyze an object in a vehicle video uploaded by a seller, and an artificial intelligence system that can filter the vehicle-specific terms and profanity from the seller's video presentation, were also developed. As a result of evaluating the developed system, the average execution speed of the proposed YOLOv3+MSSIM Type 2 algorithm was 78.6 ms faster than that of the pure YOLOv3 algorithm, and the average frame rate per second was improved by 40.22 fps. In addition, the average GPU utilization rate was improved by 23.05%, proving the efficiency.", "The lack of effective, consistent, reproducible and efficient asthma ascertainment methods results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. We aimed to assess whether application of expert artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for two existing asthma criteria to electronic health records of a paediatric population systematically identifies childhood asthma and its subgroups with distinctive characteristics.\nUsing the 1997-2007 Olmsted County Birth Cohort, we applied validated NLP algorithms for Predetermined Asthma Criteria (NLP-PAC) as well as Asthma Predictive Index (NLP-API). We categorised subjects into four groups (both criteria positive (NLP-PAC+/NLP-API+); PAC positive only (NLP-PAC+ only); API positive only (NLP-API+ only); and both criteria negative (NLP-PAC-/NLP-API-)) and characterised them. Results were replicated in unsupervised cluster analysis for asthmatics and a random sample of 300 children using laboratory and pulmonary function tests (PFTs).\nOf the 8196 subjects (51% male, 80% white), we identified 1614 (20%), NLP-PAC+/NLP-API+; 954 (12%), NLP-PAC+ only; 105 (1%), NLP-API+ only; and 5523 (67%), NLP-PAC-/NLP-API-. Asthmatic children classified as NLP-PAC+/NLP-API+ showed earlier onset asthma, more Th2-high profile, poorer lung function, higher asthma exacerbation and higher risk of asthma-associated comorbidities compared with other groups. These results were consistent with those based on unsupervised cluster analysis and lab and PFT data of a random sample of study subjects.\nExpert AI-based NLP algorithms for two asthma criteria systematically identify childhood asthma with distinctive characteristics. This approach may improve precision, reproducibility, consistency and efficiency of large-scale clinical studies for asthma and enable population management.", "This study aimed to examine the cognitive performance of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) stratified by illness phase compared to that of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls.\nParticipants were 139 patients with BD (55 euthymic and 84 depressed), 311 patients with MDD (88 euthymic and 223 depressed), and 386 healthy controls who underwent the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised or the Third Edition. They were non-elderly Japanese individuals with normal estimated premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ; >90), group-matched for age, sex, and premorbid IQ.\nThe depressed BD group showed significantly lower scores on verbal IQ, performance IQ, full-scale IQ, and three group indexes of perceptual organization, working memory, and processing speed when compared with healthy controls (all P\u2009<\u20090.001). All IQs and working memory index were also significantly lower than those of the depressed MDD group. The depressed MDD group scored significantly lower than controls in performance IQ (P\u2009<\u20090.001), full-scale IQ, and only in the index of processing speed (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The euthymic BD group scored significantly lower than controls in performance IQ (P = 0.004), whereas the euthymic MDD group scored significantly lower than controls only in processing speed (P = 0.030).\nPatients with BD appear to have global and more intense cognitive impairments in depressed states compared with those with MDD whose impairments seem to be apparent only in processing speed in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Attenuated impairments appear to exist in euthymic states of both patients.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a sort of new technical science which can simulate, extend and expand human intelligence by developing theories, methods and application systems. In the last five years, the application of AI in medical research has become a hot topic in modern science and technology. Gynecological malignant tumors involves a wide range of knowledge, and AI can play an important part in these aspects, such as medical image recognition, auxiliary diagnosis, drug research and development, treatment scheme formulation and other fields. The purpose of this paper is to describe the progress of AI in gynecological malignant tumors and discuss some problems in its application. It is believed that AI improves the efficiency of diagnosis, reduces the burden of clinicians, and improves the effect of treatment and prognosis. AI will play an irreplaceable role in the field of gynecological malignant oncology and will promote the development of medicine and further promote the transformation from traditional medicine to precision medicine and preventive medicine. However, there are also some problems in the application of AI in gynecologic malignant tumors. For example, AI, inseparable from human participation, still needs to be more \"humanized\", and needs to further protect patients' privacy and health, improve legal and insurance protection, and further improve according to local ethnic conditions and national conditions. However, it is believed that with the continuous development of AI, especially ensemble classifier, and deep learning will have a profound influence on the future of medical technology, which is a powerful driving force for future medical innovation and reform.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being proposed for use in medicine, including breast cancer screening (BCS). Little is known, however, about referring primary care providers' (PCPs') preferences for this technology.\nWe identified the most important attributes of AI BCS for ordering PCPs using qualitative interviews: sensitivity, specificity, radiologist involvement, understandability of AI decision-making, supporting evidence, and diversity of training data. We invited US-based PCPs to participate in an internet-based experiment designed to force participants to trade off among the attributes of hypothetical AI BCS products. Responses were analyzed with random parameters logit and latent class models to assess how different attributes affect the choice to recommend AI-enhanced screening.\nNinety-one PCPs participated. Sensitivity was most important, and most PCPs viewed radiologist participation in mammography interpretation as important. Other important attributes were specificity, understandability of AI decision-making, and diversity of data. We identified 3 classes of respondents: \"Sensitivity First\" (41%) found sensitivity to be more than twice as important as other attributes; \"Against AI Autonomy\" (24%) wanted radiologists to confirm every image; \"Uncertain Trade-Offs\" (35%) viewed most attributes as having similar importance. A majority (76%) accepted the use of AI in a \"triage\" role that would allow it to filter out likely negatives without radiologist confirmation.\nSensitivity was the most important attribute overall, but other key attributes should be addressed to produce clinically acceptable products. We also found that most PCPs accept the use of AI to make determinations about likely negative mammograms without radiologist confirmation.", "Accumulating research points to the importance of incremental theories of emotion. Yet, little is known about whether these beliefs change in adulthood across long time spans, and if so, whether such changes are prospectively linked to emotion regulation outcomes. In the present investigation, we tested how incremental theories of emotion change during college, and whether such changes are linked to emotion regulation practices. We followed 394 undergraduates as they entered and ultimately graduated from college. Focusing on the temporal dynamics of incremental theories of emotion, we found that they were somewhat stable, and their mean-level increased over time. Focusing on the correlates of such changes, we found that students who during college came to believe that emotions (but not intelligence) are more controllable, ended up using more cognitive reappraisal (but not expressive suppression) at the end of college. Similarly, students who during college came to use cognitive reappraisal (but not expressive suppression) more frequently, ended up believing that emotion (but not intelligence) is more controllable at the end of college. This pattern could not be explained by differences in initial levels or by differences in underlying affective experiences. We discuss potential implications of these findings for understanding the interplay between beliefs and emotion regulation.

In academic contexts, domain-general implicit theories of ability (e.g., intelligence) and their relation to self-regulated learning (SRL) have been examined.\nIn this study, we followed a domain-specific approach and first introduced scales to assess students' implicit theories of the malleability and of the relevance of SRL. Second, we investigated how implicit theories of SRL are related to students' SRL. Third, we examined the relationship of implicit theories of SRL with students' demographics and personality traits.\nParticipants were students from a medium-sized university in Germany (N\u00a0=\u00a0254) aged M\u00a0=\u00a023.85\u00a0years.\nData on students' demographics and personality traits, implicit theories of intelligence (INT), achievement goals, and learning strategies were collected with well-established measures. In addition, students' implicit theories of SRL and their declarative metacognitive knowledge about SRL were assessed with measures developed within this study. Confirmatory factor analyses and regression analyses were performed.\nThe two postulated dimensions of implicit theories of SRL were supported. As expected, implicit theories of SRL were more strongly related to students' achievement goals, learning strategies, and metacognitive knowledge than implicit theories of INT. Moreover, implicit theories of SRL were mostly unrelated to students' demographics and personality traits.\nThe results emphasize that domain-specific implicit theories of SRL contribute substantially to the explanation of students' SRL. Thus, further research on SRL should consider domain-specific implicit theories of SRL in addition to implicit theories of INT.", "Aims: To evaluate the ocular and systemic factors involved in cataract surgery complications in a teaching hospital using artificial intelligence. Methods: One eye of 1,229 patients with a mean age of 70.2 \u00b1 10.3 years old that underwent cataract surgery was selected for this study. Ocular and systemic details of the patients were recorded and then analyzed by means of artificial intelligence. A total of 1.25 billion simulations of artificial intelligence learning and testing were conducted on several variables and a customized model of analysis was developed. Results: A total of 73 complications were recorded in this study. According to the analysis performed, the main factors involved in cataract surgery complications were: a surgeon in training, axial length and intraocular lens power. The model predicted how long surgery would last with an error of <6 min compared to the effective time needed. Conclusions: According to the data here obtained, artificial intelligence could be an interesting option to build customized models able to prevent complications and to predict actual surgery time. The customized algorithm option allows the development of better models adaptable to different units as well as the possibility to be calibrated for the same unit along time.", "Objective: To investigate the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of an artificial intelligence (AI) triaging model in a diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening program. Methods: A DR screening program was conducted in Kashi City and Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture of the Xinjiang Uyur Autonomous Region from May to July 2018, and 8 005 patients with diabetes mellitus were included. Fundus images, one centered at optic disc and one centered at macula, were taken for both eyes. A previously validated AI algorithm was applied as the first step to identify the patients with all 4 images. If the images were classified as gradable and negative DR, an AI-generated report was immediately provided without sending to manual grading, and 1/3 of these patients were randomly sampled for manual grading and quality control (group A). For the patients with at least one image classified as ungradable or positive for any DR, all images were sent for manual grading (group B). Finally, 300 patients were randomly selected from group A and group B respectively for accuracy assessment, where the patients and their images were classified by a specialist panel for referral DR (pre-proliferative DR, or proliferative DR, and/or diabetic macular edema). Results: Among 8 005 patients for DR screening [including 3 220 males and 4 785 females, aged (58.3\u00b110.6) years], after AI triaging, 5 267 (65.8%) potentially received reports from AI system and 2 738 (34.2%) required manual grading. In group A, the accuracy and specificity of AI classification and manual grading on referral DR were all 100%. In group B, the accuracy of AI and manual grading were 75.8% and 90.3%, respectively, while the sensitivity of AI and manual grading was 100% and 79.1%, respectively. Conclusion: AI alleviates 60% of the workload of manual grading without missing any referral patients with the aid of the current AI triaging model.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u521d\u7b5b\u5206\u6d41\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\uff08DR\uff09\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a 2018\u5e745\u81f37\u6708\u5728\u65b0\u7586\u7ef4\u543e\u5c14\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a\u5580\u4ec0\u5e02\u548c\u514b\u5b5c\u52d2\u82cf\u67ef\u5c14\u514b\u5b5c\u81ea\u6cbb\u5dde\uff0c8 005\u4f8b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u53c2\u52a0\u4e86DR\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u5747\u884c\u514d\u6563\u77b3\u7684\u773c\u5e95\u5f69\u7167\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u6bcf\u773c\u91c7\u96c62\u5f20\u773c\u5e95\u5f69\u7167\uff08\u5206\u522b\u4ee5\u89c6\u76d8\u548c\u9ec4\u6591\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff09\u3002\u62cd\u7167\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u76844\u5f20\u773c\u5e95\u5f69\u7167\u8fdb\u884c\u5224\u5b9a\uff0c\u5982\u5747\u4e3a\u53ef\u5206\u7ea7\u4e14\u65e0DR\u65f6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ea7\u751fAI\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5e76\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u53d61/3\u81f3\u8bfb\u7247\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7531\u773c\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u7ec4\u5206\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\uff08\u7ec4A\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u59824\u5f20\u773c\u5e95\u5f69\u7167\u4e2d\uff0c\u4efb\u610f\u4e00\u5f20\u56fe\u7247\u5224\u522b\u4e3a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5206\u7ea7\u6216\u5b58\u5728DR\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6240\u6709\u773c\u5e95\u5f69\u7167\u5747\u9700\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u5206\u7ea7\uff08\u7ec4B\uff09\u3002\u4ece\u7ec4A\u548c\u7ec4B\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u53d6300\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u773c\u5e95\u7167\u7247\uff0c\u7531\u773c\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u7ec4\u4f5c\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u5224\u522b\uff0c\u786e\u5b9aAI\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u5206\u7ea7\u5224\u5b9a\u9700\u8f6c\u8bcaDR\uff08\u589e\u6b96\u524d\u6216\u589e\u6b96\u671fDR\uff0c\u6216\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u9ec4\u6591\u6c34\u80bf\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u57288 005\u4f8b\u53c2\u52a0\u7b5b\u67e5\u7684\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\uff0c\u75373 220\u4f8b\uff0840.2%\uff09\uff0c\u59734 785\u4f8b\uff0859.8%\uff09\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\uff0858.3\u00b110.6\uff09\u5c81\u3002\u7ecfAI\u521d\u7b5b\u540e\uff0cAI\u76f4\u63a5\u4ea7\u751f\u62a5\u544a5 267\u4f8b\uff0865.8%\uff09\uff0c\u53e6\u59162 738\u4f8b\uff0834.2%\uff09\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u5de5\u5206\u7ea7\u3002\u5728\u7ec4A\u4e2d\uff0cAI\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u5224\u5b9a\u9700\u8f6c\u8bcaDR\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u5ea6\u5747\u4e3a100.0%\u3002\u5728\u7ec4B\u4e2d\uff0cAI\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u5224\u5b9a\u9700\u8f6c\u8bcaDR\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5206\u522b\u4e3a75.8%\u548c90.3%\uff0c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u4e3a100%\u548c79.1%\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684DR\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528AI\u4f5c\u4e3aDR\u7684\u521d\u7b5b\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u9057\u6f0f\u9700\u8f6c\u8bcaDR\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea660%\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u5206\u7ea7\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002.", "1D semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have been extensively studied in recent years due to the predominant mechanical flexibility caused by a large surface-to-volume ratio and unique electrical and optical properties induced by the 1D quantum confinement effect. Herein, we use a top-down two-step preparation method to synthesize AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunction NWs with controllable size. A single NW is transferred to a flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate and fixed by indium tin oxide electrodes to form an ohmic contact for the strain sensor. An external mechanical stress is introduced to study the performance of the fabricated piezotronic strain sensor. The gauge factor is as high as 30 under compressive or tensile stress, which indicates a high sensitivity of the strain sensor. Periodic strain tests show the high stability and repeatability of the sensor. The working mechanism of the strain sensor is investigated and systematically analyzed under compressive and tensile strain. Here, we describe a strain sensor that shows a great application potential in wearable integrated circuits, in health-monitoring devices, and in artificial intelligence.", "Musical prodigies reach exceptionally high levels of achievement before adolescence. Despite longstanding interest and fascination in musical prodigies, little is known about their psychological profile. Here we assess to what extent practice, intelligence, and personality make musical prodigies a distinct category of musician. Nineteen former or current musical prodigies (aged 12-34) were compared to 35 musicians (aged 14-37) with either an early (mean age 6) or late (mean age 10) start but similar amount of musical training, and 16 non-musicians (aged 14-34). All completed a Wechsler IQ test, the Big Five Inventory, the Autism Spectrum Quotient, the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire, the Dispositional Flow Scale, and a detailed history of their lifetime music practice. None of the psychological traits distinguished musical prodigies from control musicians or non-musicians except their propensity to report flow during practice. The other aspects that differentiated musical prodigies from their peers were the intensity of their practice before adolescence, and the source of their motivation when they began to play. Thus practice, by itself, does not make a prodigy. The results are compatible with multifactorial models of expertise, with prodigies lying at the high end of the continuum. In summary, prodigies are expected to present brain predispositions facilitating their success in learning an instrument, which could be amplified by their early and intense practice happening at a moment when brain plasticity is heightened.", "Introduction: Testicular torsion (TT) is a common emergency that warrants immediate exploration to prevent infertility or testicular loss. To improve diagnostic reliability, various scoring systems have been published. The aim of this study was to evaluate and validate different testicular torsion scores in a large cohort of children with acute scrotum. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all male children that were admitted for acute scrotum at the Pediatric Surgery Department of the Altonaer Kinderkrankenhaus and University medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf from 01/2013 to 03/2019. Two testicular torsion scores (Boettcher Alert Score, Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion Score) were applied to all data sets. Furthermore, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based score was developed and compared to the two current scores. Results: In total, 460 boys were included in the study. Of those, 48 (10.4%) had TT. Children with TT suffered most often from short duration of pain, nausea and vomiting, high riding testicle and absent cremasteric reflex. The BALS and the AI-based score had excellent predictive values and all patients with TT would have been detected. Conclusion: The BAL and the AI score show excellent predictive capabilities and may be used to identify all cases of TT in a pediatric population. The scores are easy to apply. As the BALS was slightly better, we advocate to use this score but to validate our findings in prospective multicenter studies.", "The primary technique for detecting the presence and monitoring the development of carotid atherosclerotic plaque is ultrasound. The development of ultrasound techniques has made it possible to precisely visualise not only blood flow, but also vessel walls, including atherosclerotic plaque. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination enables one to make an objective observation of atherosclerotic plaque neovascularisation, clearly indicating active inflammation, which is an inherent feature of vulnerable (unstable) plaque. Depending on the examination method used, it is possible to precisely visualise different components of the plaque and its behaviour during blood flow through the vessel lumen or through the neovessels of the plaque, and, consequently, determine the possible presence of inflammation, which is a defining feature of plaque stability. The full utilisation of physical phenomena that underlie contrast-enhanced ultrasound will bring further enormous progress of diagnostic and probably also therapeutic methods for carotid atherosclerosis. The selection of the right examination method significantly accelerates diagnosis and adequate classification of plaque, and makes it possible to monitor the progression of atherosclerosis. However, one needs to bear in mind that ultrasound remains a very subjective method. The success of contrast-enhanced ultrasound also depends on the skills and experience of the examiner. Current attempts at increasing the objectivity of contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination using artificial intelligence will make it possible in the future to make a definitive evaluation of atherosclerotic plaque stability. This will allow one to assess the risk of ischaemic stroke adequately.", "Past research regarding the emotional characteristics of kibbutz children raised with communal sleeping arrangements (CSA) showed inconsistent findings for emotional difficulties, such as insecure attachment and lowered ability for intimacy. Only little research has examined these children's emotional characteristics in their adulthood. Trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) is a new concept measuring a constellation of correlated emotional traits that capture a person's typical way of processing emotional information and reacting to it. The present study examined if difficulties in intimacy and trait EI characterize adults who had been raised in CSA kibbutzim (Hebrew plural of kibbutz). Participants comprised 1185 adults, aged 30-79, of whom 735 were raised in CSA kibbutzim, and the rest did not grow up in a Kibbutz at all. The participants completed three self-report questionnaires: Schutte's Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT) to measure trait EI; the Revised Adult Attachment Scale to measure adult attachment; and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Questionnaire to measure self-esteem. Results showed that most of the kibbutz CSA participants revealed levels of intimacy and trait EI comparable to the non-kibbutz group. However, a significant difference was found among adults with low self-esteem and poor attachment quality: For these participants, trait EI and intimacy were significantly lower for the CSA kibbutz group than for the non-kibbutz group. Furthermore, the CSA kibbutz group reported poorer non-verbal communication skills than the non-kibbutz group. We suggest that a minority of the CSA kibbutz children were less resilient to the kibbutz ecology. These children might have been more vulnerable to the effects of limited social options, decreased parental support, and the kibbutz education's ideological demands. For these children, the effects of communal upbringing on intimacy and attachment appear to be long-lasting, extending throughout their adulthood.", "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and is associated with negative long-term outcomes. Given the heterogeneity of the syndrome, the ability to predict outcomes of AKI may be beneficial towards effectively using resources and personalising AKI care. This systematic review will identify, describe and assess current models in the literature for the prediction of outcomes in hospitalised patients with AKI.\nRelevant literature from a comprehensive search across six databases will be imported into Covidence.

Studies to be included are cohort studies and randomised controlled trials with at least 100 subjects, adult hospitalised patients, with AKI. Only those studies evaluating multivariable predictive models reporting a statistical measure of accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve or C-statistic) and predicting resolution of AKI, progression of AKI, subsequent dialysis and mortality will be included. Data extraction will be performed independently by two team members, with a third reviewer available to resolve conflicts. Results will be reported using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Risk of bias will be assessed using Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool.\nWe are committed to open dissemination of our results through the registration of our systematic review on PROSPERO and future publication.

Researches are ongoing to develop vaccines and traditional methods of Medicine and Biology have been applied in diagnosis and treatment. Though there are success stories of recovered cases as of November 10, 2020, there are no approved treatments and vaccines for COVID-19. As the pandemic continues to spread, current measures rely on prevention, surveillance, and containment. In light of this, emerging technologies for tackling COVID-19 become inevitable. Emerging technologies including geospatial technology, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, telemedicine, blockchain, 5G technology, smart applications, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), robotics, and additive manufacturing are substantially important for COVID-19 detecting, monitoring, diagnosing, screening, surveillance, mapping, tracking, and creating awareness. Therefore, this study aimed at providing a comprehensive review of these technologies for tackling COVID-19 with emphasis on the features, challenges, and country of domiciliation. Our results show that performance of the emerging technologies is not yet stable due to nonavailability of enough COVID-19 dataset, inconsistency in some of the dataset available, nonaggregation of the dataset due to contrasting data format, missing data, and noise. Moreover, the security and privacy of people's health information is not totally guaranteed. Thus, further research is required to strengthen the current technologies and there is a strong need for the emergence of a robust computationally intelligent model for early differential diagnosis of COVID-19.", "To create a new strategy for monitoring pediatric otitis media (OM), we developed a brief, reliable, and objective method for automated classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with images from otoscope.\nProspective study.\nAn otoscopic image classifier for pediatric OM was built upon the idea of deep learning and transfer learning using the two most widely used CNN architectures named Xception and MobileNet-V2. Otoscopic images, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and normal ears were obtained from our institution. Among qualified otoendoscopic images, 10,703 images were used for training, and 1,500 images were used for testing. In addition, 102 images captured by smartphone with WI-FI connected otoscope were used as a prospective test set to evaluate the model for home screening and monitoring.\nFor all diagnoses combined in the test set, the Xception model and the MobileNet-V2 model had similar overall accuracies of 97.45% (95% CI 96.81%-97.94%) and 95.72% (95% CI 95.12%-96.16%). The overall accuracies of two models with smartphone images were 90.66% (95% CI 90.21%-90.98%) and 88.56% (95% CI 87.86%-90.05%). The class activation map results showed that the extracted features of smartphone images were the same as those of otoendoscopic images.\nWe have developed deep learning algorithms for the successfully automated classification of pediatric AOM and OME with otoscopic images. With a smartphone-enabled wireless otoscope, artificial intelligence may assist parents in early detection and continuous monitoring at home to decrease the visit frequencies.\nNA Laryngoscope, 131:E2344-E2351, 2021.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a combination of different technologies that enable machines to sense, comprehend, and learn with human-like levels of intelligence. AI technology will eventually enhance human capability, provide machines genuine autonomy, and reduce errors, and increase productivity and efficiency. AI seems promising, and the field is full of invention, novel applications; however, the limitation of machine learning suggests a cautious optimism as the right strategy. AI is also becoming incorporated into medicine to improve patient care by speeding up processes and achieving greater accuracy for optimal patient care. AI using deep learning technology has been used to identify, differentiate catalog images in several medical fields including gastrointestinal endoscopy. The gastrointestinal endoscopy field involves endoscopic diagnoses and prognostication of various digestive diseases using image analysis with the help of various gastrointestinal endoscopic device systems. AI-based endoscopic systems can reliably detect and provide crucial information on gastrointestinal pathology based on their training and validation. These systems can make gastroenterology practice easier, faster, more reliable, and reduce inter-observer variability in the coming years. However, the thought that these systems will replace human decision making replace gastrointestinal endoscopists does not seem plausible in the near future. In this review, we discuss AI and associated various technological terminologies, evolving role in gastrointestinal endoscopy, and future possibilities.", "Cerebral visual impairment (CVI) is the leading cause of childhood visual impairment in the developed world. Despite this, there are no agreed clinical guidelines for the investigation and diagnosis of the condition. Before development of such guidelines can commence, it is important to recognise which approaches are currently employed. This systematic review evaluated the literature to identify which methods of assessment are currently used to investigate and diagnose childhood CVI.\nMedline, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched in January 2020 using defined search terms. Articles were included if they: (i) were research papers, conference abstracts or research protocols published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, or relevant textbooks; (ii) included a clinical investigation of CVI in children; (iii) provided an explanation or criteria to diagnose CVI and (iv) were specifically investigating cerebral/cortical visual impairment. Methods used to a) assess and b) diagnose CVI were extracted from included articles. 'Assessment scores' were assigned for each method employed by researchers to investigate and diagnose CVI to quantify and compare approaches between articles. A quality grading was also applied to each article.\nOf 6454 identified articles, 45 met the inclusion criteria. From these, 10 categories of assessment utilised within included articles were identified: (1) Medical history, (2) Vision assessment/ophthalmologic examination, (3) Neuroimaging, (4) Visual behaviour and direct observation, (5) Structured history-taking, (6) Visual perception tests, (7) Ocular movement and posture assessment, (8) Intelligence/IQ assessment, (9) Clinical electrophysiology and (10) Neurodevelopmental tests. In terms of diagnostic criteria, the most commonly reported approach was one of exclusion, i.e., CVI was diagnosed when visual dysfunction could not be attributed to abnormalities detected in the anterior visual pathway.\nThere is a lack of common practice in the approaches used by clinicians to investigate and diagnose CVI in children. At present, a 'diagnosis of exclusion' remains the most common means to diagnose CVI. Development of clinical guidelines for assessment and diagnosis are necessary to ensure consistency in the diagnosis of CVI and the timely implementation of support to alleviate the impact of CVI on the child's daily living.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly progressed, with exciting opportunities that drive enthusiasm for significant projects. A sensible and sustainable approach would be to start building an AI footprint with smaller, machine learning (ML)-based initiatives using artificial neural networks before progressing to more complex deep learning (DL) approaches using convolutional neural networks. Several strategies and examples of entry-level projects are outlined, including mock potential projects using convolutional neural networks toward which we can progress. The examples provide a narrow snapshot of potential applications designed to inspire readers to think outside the box at problem solving using AI and ML. The simple and resource-light ML approaches are ideal for problem solving, are accessible starting points for developing an institutional AI program, and provide solutions that can have a significant and immediate impact on practice. A logical approach would be to use ML to examine the problem and identify among the broader ML projects which problems are most likely to benefit from a DL approach.", "Illicit drug trafficking and in particular amphetamine-type stimulants continue to be a major problem in Australia. With the constant evolution of illicit drugs markets, it is necessary to gain as much knowledge about them to disrupt or reduce their impact. Illicit drug specimens can be analysed to generate forensic intelligence and understand criminal activities. Part of this analysis involves the evaluation of similarity scores between illicit drug profiles to interpret the link value. Most studies utilise one of two prominent score evaluation approaches, i.e. deterministic or Bayesian. In previous work, the notion of a dual approach was suggested, which emphasised the complementary nature of the two mentioned approaches. The aim of this study was to assess the operational capability of a dual approach in evaluating similarity scores between illicit drug profiles. Utilising a practical example, link values were generated individually from both approaches, then compared in parallel. As a result, it was possible to generate more informed hypotheses, relating to specimen linkage, due to the greater wealth of information available from the two approaches working concurrently. Additionally, it was shown that applying only one approach led to less information being generated during analysis as well as potentially important links between illicit drug specimens being missed.", "Mild cognitive dysfunction has been implicated in a number of psychiatric diseases and affects social functioning. Although clinical criteria were recently proposed for autoimmune psychosis (AP), biomarkers have not yet been established for the severity and prognosis of cognitive dysfunction. We herein investigated the relationships between 3 types of serum antibodies and cognitive dysfunction in chronic psychiatric patients suspected of AP.\nWe included 31 patients suspected of AP and obtained information on their clinical characteristics. Three types of autoantibodies (the anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR Ab), anti-N-terminal of GluN1 (anti-GluN1-NT Ab), and anti-thyroid antibodies) were evaluated in serum. Cognitive function was assessed using Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III. We examined the relationships between serum autoantibodies and cognitive dysfunction in patients using multiple regression models.\nSerum titers of anti-GluN1-NT Ab significantly contributed to the estimated score of working memory (B= -55.85, \u03b2= -0.46, p=\u202f0.01), while no correlation was observed between the other 2 types of antibodies and cognitive function.\nThe present results indicate the potential of serum anti-GluN1-NT Ab as a biomarker for the severity and prognosis of cognitive dysfunction underlying various psychiatric symptoms in patients with AP. The pathological significance of anti-GluN1-NT Ab needs to be verified in future studies.", "The Bubonic Plague outbreak that wormed its way through San Francisco's Chinatown in 1900 tells a story of prejudice guiding health policy, resulting in enormous suffering for much of its Chinese population. This article seeks to discuss the potential for hidden \"prejudice\" should Artificial Intelligence (AI) gain a dominant foothold in healthcare systems. Using a toy model, this piece explores potential future outcomes, should AI continue to develop without bound. Where potential dangers may lurk will be discussed, so that the full benefits AI has to offer can be reaped whilst avoiding the pitfalls. The model is produced using the computer programming language MATLAB and offers visual representations of potential outcomes. Interwoven with these potential outcomes are numerous historical models for problems caused by prejudice and recent issues in AI systems, from police prediction and facial recognition software to recruitment tools. Therefore, this research's novel angle, of using historical precedents to model and discuss potential futures, offers a unique contribution.\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00146-020-01120-w.", "Ambient intelligence is increasingly finding applications in health-care settings, such as helping to ensure clinician and patient safety by monitoring staff compliance with clinical best practices or relieving staff of burdensome documentation tasks. Ambient intelligence involves using contactless sensors and contact-based wearable devices embedded in health-care settings to collect data (eg, imaging data of physical spaces, audio data, or body temperature), coupled with machine learning algorithms to efficiently and effectively interpret these data. Despite the promise of ambient intelligence to improve quality of care, the continuous collection of large amounts of sensor data in health-care settings presents ethical challenges, particularly in terms of privacy, data management, bias and fairness, and informed consent. Navigating these ethical issues is crucial not only for the success of individual uses, but for acceptance of the field as a whole.", "Artificial intelligence-based computer-aided diagnostic systems have been introduced for thyroid cancer diagnosis. Our aim was to compare the diagnostic performance of a commercially available computer-aided diagnostic system and radiologist-based assessment for the detection of thyroid cancer based on the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (TIRADS) and dichotomous outcomes.\nIn total, 372 consecutive patients with 454 thyroid nodules were enrolled. The computer-aided diagnostic system was set up to render a possible diagnosis in 2 formats, the Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology (K)-TIRADS and the American Thyroid Association (ATA)-TIRADS-classifications, and dichotomous outcomes (possibly benign or possibly malignant).\nThe diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the computer-aided diagnostic system for thyroid cancer were, respectively, 97.6%, 21.6%, 42.0%, 93.9%, and 49.6% for K-TIRADS; 94.6%, 29.6%, 43.9%, 90.4%, and 53.5% for ATA-TIRADS; and 81.4%, 81.9%, 72.3%, 88.3%, and 81.7% for dichotomous outcomes. The sensitivities of the computer-aided diagnostic system did not differ significantly from those of the radiologist (all P\u2009>\u2009.05); the specificities and accuracies were significantly lower than those of the radiologist (all P\u2009<\u2009.001). Unnecessary fine-needle aspiration rates were lower for the dichotomous outcome characterizations, particularly for those performed by the radiologist. The interobserver agreement for the description of K-TIRADS and ATA-TIRADS classifications was fair-to-moderate, but the dichotomous outcomes were in substantial agreement.\nThe diagnostic performance of the computer-aided diagnostic system varies in terms of TIRADS classification and dichotomous outcomes and relative to radiologist-based assessments. Clinicians should know about the strengths and weaknesses associated with the diagnosis of thyroid cancer using computer-aided diagnostic systems.", "The triage and initial care of injured patients and a subsequent right level of care is paramount for an overall outcome after traumatic injury. Early recognition of patients is an important case of such decision-making with risk of worse prognosis. This article is to answer if clinical and paraclinical signs can predict the critical conditions of injured patients after traumatic injury resuscitation.\nThe study included 1107 trauma patients, 16 years and older. The patients were trauma victims of Levels I and II triage and admitted to the Rajaee (Emtiaz) Trauma Hospital, Shiraz, in 2014-2015. The cross-industry process for data mining methodology and modeling was used for assessing the best early clinical and paraclinical variables to predict the patients' prognosis. Five modeling methods including the support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor algorithms, Bagging and Adaboost, and the neural network were compared by some evaluation criteria.\nLearning algorithms can predict the deterioration of injured patients by monitoring the Bagging and SVM models with 99% accuracy. The most-fitted variables were Glasgow Coma Scale score, base deficit, and diastolic blood pressure especially after initial resuscitation in the algorithms for overall outcome predictions.\nData mining could help in triage, initial treatment, and further decision-making for outcome measures in trauma patients. Clinical and paraclinical variables after resuscitation could predict short-term outcomes much better than variables on arrival. With artificial intelligence modeling system, diastolic blood pressure after resuscitation has a greater association with predicting early mortality rather than systolic blood pressure after resuscitation. Artificial intelligence monitoring may have a role in trauma care and should be further investigated.", "To evaluate retinal fluid volume data extracted from optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans by artificial intelligence algorithms in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NV-AMD).\nPerspective.\nA review was performed of retinal image repository datasets from diverse clinical settings.\nClinical trial (HARBOR) and trial follow-on (Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 10-year Follow-On); real-world (Belfast and Tel-Aviv tertiary centers).\n24,362 scans of 1,095 eyes (HARBOR); 4,673 of 880 (Belfast); 1,470 of 132 (Tel-Aviv); 511 of 511 (Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 10-year Follow-On). ObservationProcedures: Vienna Fluid Monitor or Notal OCT Analyzer applied to macular cube scans. OutcomeMeasures: Intraretinal fluid (IRF), subretinal fluid (SRF), and pigment epithelial detachment (PED) volumes.\nThe fluid volumes measured in neovascular AMD were expressed efficiently in nanoliters. Large ranges that differed by population were observed at the treatment-na\u00efve stage: 0-3,435 nL (IRF), 0-5,018 nL (SRF), and 0-10,022 nL (PED). Mean volumes decreased rapidly and consistently with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. During maintenance therapy, mean IRF volumes were highest in Tel-Aviv (100 nL), lower in Belfast and HARBOR-Pro Re Nata, and lowest in HARBOR-monthly (21 nL). Mean SRF volumes were low in all: 30 nL (HARBOR-monthly) and 48-49 nL (others).\nQuantitative measures of IRF, SRF, and PED are important biomarkers in NV-AMD. Accurate volumes can be extracted efficiently from OCT scans by artificial intelligence algorithms to guide the treatment of exudative macular diseases. Automated fluid monitoring identifies fluid characteristics in different NV-AMD populations at baseline and during follow-up. For consistency between studies, we propose the nanoliter as a convenient unit. We explore the advantages of using these quantitative metrics in clinical practice and research.", "Coronavirus outbreak during 2020 brought enormous challenges for the world of sport and exercise. Much debated lockdown finished with the first wave in most countries and the \"new normal\" was the new beginning for professional and recreational sport activities. The aim of this narrative review is to acknowledge the most important medical and health aspects of sport and exercise participation until COVID-19 pandemic is resolved. Management of existing crisis creates numerous opportunities for medical advances. Remote testing, tele-health, field laboratories, continuous follow-up of professional athletes, technological advances and artificial intelligence in new sporting environment using multidisciplinary, and systematic approach can be now thoroughly evaluated and defined for the best SEM practices. Sports and exercise medicine expertise in prevention can have a decisive role in dealing with ongoing and future pandemics.", "Precision medicine (MP), using machine learning (ML) techniques of artificial intelligence (AI), analyzes the so-called \"big data\" to improve diagnostic skills and predictive response to therapy, in order to tailor the treatment on individual characteristics. Furthermore, the use of large databases is limited by their very nature, as data and not values, capable of threatening the validity and generalizability of the conclusions. Currently, for this reason, interventions on populations, subpopulations or groups are still fundamental, favoring, especially in the pharmacological field, the response of the \"average patient\", over the particular case. Therefore, it is essential to carry out methodologically robust, prospective studies of comparison between teams of doctors who use systems based on algorithms and teams that do not are using them, avoiding direct comparisons, less significant, between doctors and AI. Only in this case will technologies effectively applicable in real rather than experimental clinical contexts be implemented in the near future.", "The disease brought about by the SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 coronavirus has had an unprecedented global impact. Confinement to control the outbreak may have mental health consequences for the most vulnerable in the population, including adolescents. This study aims to describe and analyze the relationships between the stress variables, Emotional Intelligence and the intention to use cannabis in healthy adolescents, before and after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic containment stage. A comparative correlational study was carried out with validated self-completed questionnaires through an online platform. The sample is made up of adolescents (n = 300) aged 13-17 from two different schools in Ponferrada (Le\u00f3n, Spain). The analysis of correlation and differences between the groups indicate that confinement has had effects on the mental health of the adolescents, specifically on the emotional manifestations of stress. Furthermore, significant gender differences were found for stress values and Emotional Intelligence. However, no differences have been found for cannabis use intention.", "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a standard surgical treatment option in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Adverse effects on cognitive function have been reported, impacting the quality of life of patients and caregivers. We aimed to investigate a quantitative predictive preexisting cognitive factor for predicting postoperative cognitive changes.\nThirty-five patients underwent STN-DBS. A battery of neuropsychological tests were used to examine executive function, processing speed, and visuospatial function both preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between preoperative factors and cognitive outcomes. The predictive value of the preoperative factors for global cognitive decline during long-term follow-up were evaluated.\nThe patients exhibited significant changes in processing speed and visuospatial function after surgery. Using reliable change index values, lower preoperative scores on the Similarities and Object Assembly subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III were associated with decreases in visuospatial function at 1 year after DBS. The odds ratios were 10.2 for Similarities and 9.53 for Object Assembly. The proportion of Mini Mental State Examination-maintained patients with low scores on the Similarities subtest was significantly lower than that of patients with high scores at 3 and 5 years. No factors were found to be related to decreases in processing speed.\nPreoperative evaluation of the Similarities and Object Assembly subtests may be useful to identify patients who are at a greater risk of experiencing decreases in visuospatial functioning after STN-DBS. Furthermore, a low score on the Similarities subtest may predict future global cognitive deterioration.", "Excessive fluoride exposure is related to adverse health outcomes, but whether dopamine (DA) relative genes are involved in the health effect of low-moderate fluoride exposure on children's intelligence remain unclear.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study to explore the role of DA relative genes in the health effect of low-moderate fluoride exposure in drinking water.\nWe recruited 567 resident children, aged 6-11 years old, randomly from endemic and non-endemic fluorosis areas in Tianjin, China. Spot urine samples were tested for urinary fluoride concentration, combined Raven`s test was used for intelligence quotient test. Fasting venous blood were collected to analyze ANKK1 Taq1A (rs1800497), COMT Val158Met (rs4680), DAT1 40\u00a0bp VNTR and MAOA uVNTR. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess associations between fluoride exposure and IQ scores. We applied multiplicative and additive models to appraise single gene-environment interaction. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to evaluate high-dimensional interactions of gene-gene and gene-environment.\nIn adjusted model, fluoride exposure was inversely associated with IQ scores (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-5.957, 95% CI: -9.712, -2.202). The mean IQ scores of children with high-activity MAOA genotype was significantly lower than IQ scores of those with low-activity (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) or female heterozygote (P\u00a0=\u00a00.016) genotype. We detected effect modification by four DA relative genes (ANKK1, COMT, DAT1 and MAOA) on the association between UF and IQ scores. We also found a high-dimensional gene-environment interaction among UF, ANKK1, COMT and MAOA on the effect of IQ (testing balanced accuracy = 0.5302, CV consistency: 10/10, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0107).\nOur study suggests DA relative genes may modify the association between fluoride and intelligence, and a potential interaction among fluoride exposure and DA relative genes on IQ.", "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been actively promoting the use of real-world data (RWD) in drug development. RWD can generate important real-world evidence reflecting the real-world clinical environment where the treatments are used. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine- and deep-learning (ML/DL) methods, have been increasingly used across many stages of the drug development process. Advancements in AI have also provided new strategies to analyze large, multidimensional RWD. Thus, we conducted a rapid review of articles from the past 20 years, to provide an overview of the drug development studies that use both AI and RWD. We found that the most popular applications were adverse event detection, trial recruitment, and drug repurposing. Here, we also discuss current research gaps and future opportunities.", "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in the field of radiology is becoming more common. Several studies have demonstrated the potential utility of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques as aids for radiologists to solve specific radiological challenges. The decision-making process, the establishment of specific clinical or radiological targets, the profile of the different professionals involved in the development of AI solutions, and the relation with partnerships and stakeholders are only some of the main issues that have to be faced and solved prior to starting the development of radiological AI solutions. Among all the players in this multidisciplinary team, the communication between radiologists and data scientists is essential for a successful collaborative work. There are specific skills that are inherent to radiological and medical training that are critical for identifying anatomical or clinical targets as well as for segmenting or labelling lesions. These skills would then have to be transferred, explained, and taught to the data science experts to facilitate their comprehension and integration into ML or DL algorithms. On the other hand, there is a wide range of complex software packages, deep neural-network architectures, and data transfer processes for which radiologists need the expertise of software engineers and data scientists in order to select the optimal manner to analyse and post-process this amount of data. This paper offers a summary of the top five challenges faced by radiologists and data scientists including tips and tricks to build a successful AI team.", "We here discuss human papillomavirus (HPV)-based screening avenues to achieve elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem in high-income country (HIC) settings, covering both the most recent data on the performance of HPV testing, as well as the currently most robust triage methods that are known. We also provide an outlook to several other promising, yet not fully established, options for triage that have been proposed, including methylation, dual staining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Finally, we discuss the key issue of how to adapt screening in the presence of programmatic HPV vaccination, and how this combination can best be leveraged for comprehensive cancer control. We conclude that, for the HIC setting, evidence-based and effective cervical screening methods are readily available, but whichever method or platform is chosen, we would propose that recurring audits of performance and population attendance remain common denominators for maintaining successful disease prevention.", "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains a challenge when translating knowledge from the preclinical stage to human use cases. Attempts to model human DILI directly based on the information from drug labels have had some success; however, the approach falls short of providing insights or addressing uncertainty due to the difficulty of decoupling the idiosyncratic nature of human DILI outcomes. Our approach in this comparative analysis is to leverage existing preclinical and clinical data as well as information on metabolism to better translate mammalian to human DILI. The human DILI knowledge base from the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) National Center for Toxicology Research contains 1036 pharmaceuticals from diverse therapeutic categories. A human DILI training set of 305 oral marketed drugs was prepared and a binary classification scheme applied. The second knowledge base consists of mammalian repeated dose toxicity with liver toxicity data from various regulatory sources. Within this knowledge base, we identified 278 pharmaceuticals containing 198 marketed or withdrawn oral drugs with data from the U.S. FDA new drug application and 98 active pharmaceutical ingredients from ToxCast. From this collection, a set of 225 oral drugs was prepared as the mammalian hepatotoxicity training set with particular end points of pathology findings in the liver and bile duct. Both human and mammalian data sets were processed using various learning algorithms, including artificial intelligence approaches. The external validations for both models were comparable to the training statistics. These data sets were also used to extract species-differentiating chemotypes that differentiate DILI effects on humans from mammals. A systematic workflow was devised to predict human DILI and provide mechanistic insights. For a given query molecule, both human and mammalian models are run. If the predictions are discordant, both metabolites and parents are investigated for quantitative structure-activity relationship and species-differentiating chemotypes. Their results are combined using the Dempster-Shafer decision theory to yield a final outcome prediction for human DILI with estimated uncertainty. Finally, these tools are implementable within an in silico platform for systematic evaluation.", "The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has a significant impact on people's lives, occupations, businesses, and economies globally. The world economic market is experiencing a big shift and the share market has observed crashes day-by-day. Even, the Indian economy has witnessed a slowdown in the current pandemic, and recovery of it is quite difficult. The restrictions and restrain strategies (e.g., lockdown and social distancing) introduced by the government leave many professions and facilities in a dormant state, catalyzing economy downfall. It necessitates to improve economy along with control strategies of COVID-19, which is a challenging task. To handle the above-mentioned issues, this article proposes a novel economy-boosting scheme, i.e., [Formula: see text] boost, which is a fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics (BDA) integrated with the Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based data communication. Here, a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) model is anticipated for early prediction of total positive cases as well as the economy. Then, it calculates an optimal subsegment of days, in which trade and commerce related restrictions could be reduced to control a sharp decline in the economy. Next, a spark-based pre and post unlock (PPU) analytics is carried out on the rise of COVID-19 cases to validate the intensity of testing in the country and deciding economy-boosting activities. Then, the [Formula: see text] boost scheme is evaluated based on various factors such as prediction accuracy and others while comparing to existing approaches. It facilitates healthy and profitable smart cities by the means to control pandemic with subsequent economy rise.", "To apply deep learning technology to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can identify vision-threatening conditions in high myopia patients based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) macular images.\nIn this cross-sectional, prospective study, a total of 5505 qualified OCT macular images obtained from 1048 high myopia patients admitted to Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre (ZOC) from 2012 to 2017 were selected for the development of the AI system. The independent test dataset included 412 images obtained from 91 high myopia patients recruited at ZOC from January 2019 to May 2019. We adopted the InceptionResnetV2 architecture to train four independent convolutional neural network (CNN) models to identify the following four vision-threatening conditions in high myopia: retinoschisis, macular hole, retinal detachment and pathological myopic choroidal neovascularisation. Focal Loss was used to address class imbalance, and optimal operating thresholds were determined according to the Youden Index.\nIn the independent test dataset, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were high for all conditions (0.961 to 0.999). Our AI system achieved sensitivities equal to or even better than those of retina specialists as well as high specificities (greater than 90%). Moreover, our AI system provided a transparent and interpretable diagnosis with heatmaps.\nWe used OCT macular images for the development of CNN models to identify vision-threatening conditions in high myopia patients. Our models achieved reliable sensitivities and high specificities, comparable to those of retina specialists and may be applied for large-scale high myopia screening and patient follow-up.", "Despite the advances in the diagnosis of dementia, neuropsychological assessment remains an important tool. The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) was designed to evaluate people with suspected dementia and allows for the analysis of different cognitive domains. Considering the numerous cases of early-onset dementia, specific reference standards aimed at the middle-aged population are necessary.\nTo provide normative data for the middle-aged Brazilian population in DRS and to investigate the influence of education level, age, sex, and intelligence quotient (IQ) on the results.\nOverall, 120 healthcare professionals and caregivers from a hospital, who were healthy, aged between 45 and 64 years, and had at least four years of formal education, were included in the study. They were equally divided into six groups. In each age group (45-54 and 55-64 years), there were three educational levels: 4-7, 8-11, and 12 or more (12+) years of formal education. The results are presented as mean values, standard deviations, and percentiles. Comparisons between groups were carried out for age, sex, and education level. Age, years of formal education, and IQ were also analyzed as continuous variables by Spearman's correlation.\nConcerning education level, the comparison between groups showed differences in the results for the total scale and subscales, except for the Construction subscale. No differences were found for age and sex. Correlations observed for years of formal education and IQ were similar. No correlation was found for age.\nThe present study contributes to the evaluation of dementia concerning people younger than 65 years of age and reinforces the importance of education in the interpretation of the scores.\nApesar dos avan\u00e7os no diagn\u00f3stico de dem\u00eancia, a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o neuropsicol\u00f3gica continua sendo uma importante ferramenta.

Recently, AI has also found use in enhancing the efficiency of molecular simulations, wherein AI derived slow modes are used to accelerate the simulation in targeted ways. However, while typical fields where AI is used are characterized by a plethora of data, molecular simulations, per construction, suffer from limited sampling and thus limited data. As such, the use of AI in molecular simulations can suffer from a dangerous situation where the AI-optimization could get stuck in spurious regimes, leading to incorrect characterization of the reaction coordinate (RC) for the problem at hand. When such an incorrect RC is then used to perform additional simulations, one could start to deviate progressively from the ground truth. To deal with this problem of spurious AI-solutions, here, we report a novel and automated algorithm using ideas from statistical mechanics. It is based on the notion that a more reliable AI-solution will be one that maximizes the timescale separation between slow and fast processes. To learn this timescale separation even from limited data, we use a maximum caliber-based framework. We show the applicability of this automatic protocol for three classic benchmark problems, namely, the conformational dynamics of a model peptide, ligand-unbinding from a protein, and folding/unfolding energy landscape of the C-terminal domain of protein G. We believe that our work will lead to increased and robust use of trustworthy AI in molecular simulations of complex systems.", "Web server logs have been extensively used as a source of data on the characteristics of Web traffic and users' navigational patterns. In particular, Web bot detection and online purchase prediction using methods from artificial intelligence (AI) are currently key areas of research. However, in reality, it is hard to obtain logs from actual online stores and there is no common dataset that can be used across different studies. Moreover, there is a lack of studies exploring Web traffic over a longer period of time, due to the unavailability of long-term data from server logs. The need to develop reliable models of Web traffic, Web user navigation, and e-customer behaviour calls for an up-to-date, large-volume e-commerce dataset on Web traffic. Similarly, AI problems require a sufficient amount of solid, real-life data to train and validate new models and methods. Thus, to meet a demand of a publicly available long-term e-commerce dataset, we collected access log data describing the operation of an online store over a six-month period. Using a program written in the C# language, data were aggregated, transformed, and anonymized. As a result, we release this EClog dataset in CSV format, which covers 183 days of HTTP-level e-commerce traffic. The data will be beneficial for research in many areas, including computer science, data science, management, and sociology.", "The utilization of telemedicine and telepsychiatry (TP) services in the outpatient department (OPD) has been increasing in recent years. The information about the technological, administrative, and clinical challenges is being addressed by the telemedicine and TP guidelines published by several individual nations. TP aims to address the treatment gaps, barriers for utilization, accessibility, diagnostic validity, financial implications, and individual client preferences. Utilization of TP in the OPD varies from country to country depending upon their healthcare delivery systems. It also varies in populations utilizing the TP services-urban, rural, child and adolescent, geriatric, and differently abled. TP services in the OPDs are being incorporated differentially by government organizations, insurance recognized psychiatric healthcare organizations, private psychiatric group practice deliverers, and individual, standalone psychiatric healthcare deliverers. TP may not replace the traditional in-person consultations completely. Covid-19 pandemic has hastened its utilization across several healthcare delivery systems. Healthcare organizations, clinicians, other healthcare deliverers, and end users are in the process of adapting to the new scenario. Incorporation of the big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and other technological advances in the psychiatric healthcare delivery systems into TP services in the OPDs would significantly contribute to the overall quality and efficacy of the psychiatric healthcare delivery systems in the future.", "Introduction: In multi-objective drug design, optimization gains importance, being upgraded to a discipline that attracts its own research. Current strategies are broadly classified into single - objective optimization (SOO) and multi-objective optimization (MOO).Areas covered: Starting with SOO and the ways used to incorporate multiple criteria into it, the present review focuses on MOO techniques, their comparison, advantages, and restrictions. Pareto analysis and the concept of dominance stand in the core of MOO. The Pareto front, Pareto ranking, and limitations of Pareto-based methods, due to high dimensions and data uncertainty, are outlined. Desirability functions and the weighted sum approaches are described as stand-alone techniques to transform the MOO problem to SOO or in combination with pareto analysis and evolutionary algorithms. Representative applications in different drug research areas are also discussed.Expert opinion: Despite their limitations, the use of combined MOO techniques, as well as being complementary to SOO or in conjunction with artificial intelligence, contributes dramatically to efficient drug design, assisting decisions and increasing success probabilities. For multi-target drug design, optimization is supported by network approaches, while applicability of MOO to other fields like drug technology or biological complexity opens new perspectives in the interrelated fields of medicinal chemistry and molecular biology.", "The aim of this study was to assess the attitude of dentists and dental students in Brazil regarding the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in oral radiology, and to evaluate the effect of an introductory AI lecture on their attitude.\nA questionnaire was prepared, comprising statements regarding the future role of AI in oral radiology and dentistry. A lecture of approx. 1\u2009h was prepared, comprising the basic principles of AI and a non-exhaustive overview of AI research in medicine and dentistry. Participants filled in the questionnaire prior to the lecture. After the lecture, the questionnaire was repeated.\nThroughout 7 sessions at 6 locations, 293 questionnaires were collected. The majority of participants were undergraduate dental students (57%). Prior to the lecture, there was a strong agreement regarding the various future roles and expected impact of AI in oral radiology. Approximately, one-third of participants was concerned about AI. After the lecture, agreement regarding the different roles of AI in oral radiology increased, overall excitement regarding AI increased, and concerns regarding the potential replacement of oral radiologists decreased.\nA generally positive attitude towards AI was found; an introductory lecture was beneficial towards this attitude and alleviated concerns regarding the effect of AI on the oral radiology profession. Given the unprecedented, ongoing revolution of AI-augmented radiology, it is pivotal to incorporate AI topics in dental training curricula.", "Distributed intelligent systems (DIS) appear where natural intelligence agents (humans) and artificial intelligence agents (algorithms) interact, exchanging data and decisions and learning how to evolve toward a better quality of solutions. The networked dynamics of distributed natural and artificial intelligence agents leads to emerging complexity different from the ones observed before. In this study, we review and systematize different approaches in the distributed intelligence field, including the quantum domain. A definition and mathematical model of DIS (as a new class of systems) and its components, including a general model of DIS dynamics, are introduced. In particular, the suggested new model of DIS contains both natural (humans) and artificial (computer programs, chatbots, etc.) intelligence agents, which take into account their interactions and communications. We present the case study of domain-oriented DIS based on different agents' classes and show that DIS dynamics shows complexity effects observed in other well-studied complex systems. We examine our model by means of the platform of personal self-adaptive educational assistants (avatars), especially designed in our University. Avatars interact with each other and with their owners. Our experiment allows finding an answer to the vital question: How quickly will DIS adapt to owners' preferences so that they are satisfied? We introduce and examine in detail learning time as a function of network topology. We have shown that DIS has an intrinsic source of complexity that needs to be addressed while developing predictable and trustworthy systems of natural and artificial intelligence agents. Remarkably, our research and findings promoted the improvement of the educational process at our university in the presence of COVID-19 pandemic conditions.", "Understanding human language is one of the key themes of artificial intelligence. For language representation, the capacity of effectively modeling the linguistic knowledge from the detail-riddled and lengthy texts and getting ride of the noises is essential to improve its performance. Traditional attentive models attend to all words without explicit constraint, which results in inaccurate concentration on some dispensable words. In this work, we propose using syntax to guide the text modeling by incorporating explicit syntactic constraints into attention mechanisms for better linguistically motivated word representations. In detail, for self-attention network (SAN) sponsored Transformer-based encoder, we introduce syntactic dependency of interest (SDOI) design into the SAN to form an SDOI-SAN with syntax-guided self-attention. Syntax-guided network (SG-Net) is then composed of this extra SDOI-SAN and the SAN from the original Transformer encoder through a dual contextual architecture for better linguistics inspired representation. The proposed SG-Net is applied to typical Transformer encoders. Extensive experiments on popular benchmark tasks, including machine reading comprehension, natural language inference, and neural machine translation show the effectiveness of the proposed SG-Net design.", "The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and medicine is an important milestone in the development of modern medicine, which realizes the digitalization and intelligence for clinicians in the process of diagnosis and treatment. This is not a competition between human and machine, but a collaborative progress and development. The incidence of colorectal cancer remains high in China. The introduction of AI technology in lymph node metastasis, circumferential resection margin, neoadjuvant therapy, genetic diagnosis, radiomics, pathological assistance and colonoscopy diagnosis has further improved the diagnosis and treatment, as well as the evaluation and prediction of the disease of colorectal cancer. This article will review and comment on the application of AI technology in colorectal cancer staging, neoadjuvant therapy, gene diagnosis, pathological assistance and other aspects.\n\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u533b\u5b66\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u533b\u5b66\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5728\u8bca\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5316\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u534f\u540c\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u5728\u6211\u56fd\u5c45\u9ad8\u4e0d\u4e0b\uff0cAI\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ed3\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u73af\u5468\u5207\u7f18\u3001\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u6cbb\u7597\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u3001\u75c5\u7406\u8f85\u52a9\u53ca\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u8bca\u65ad\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5f15\u5165\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u75c5\u60c5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002.", "Accurate assessment and early identification of gifted children is of great importance in terms of providing them with educational programs tailored for their abilities in specific areas. Individually administered intelligence tests are widely used to identify gifted children, and an above-average level of intellectual capacity is generally accepted as the main criterion for giftedness. This study aimed to investigate the utility of the Turkish version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) to distinguish gifted children from non-gifted children. For this purpose, 201 gifted children and 201 non-gifted children were included in the study. To be able to determine the predictive power of the WISC-IV index and subtest scores, logistic regression analyses were performed. Results indicated that the Perceptual Reasoning Index, Working Memory Index, and Processing Speed Index \u200b\u200bscores (except Verbal Comprehension Index score), and all subtest scores significantly predicted giftedness. Furthermore, correct classification rates among gifted children were 93% for index scores and 97% for subtest scores. The findings of this study suggest that intelligence scores obtained from the WISC-IV have a diagnostic utility and provide valid and reliable results in identifying gifted children.", "This Editorial analyzes the manuscripts accepted, after a careful peer-reviewed process, for the Special Issue \"Applications in Electronics Pervading Industry, Environment and Society-Sensing Systems and Pervasive Intelligence\" of the Sensors MDPI journal [...].", "It is generally agreed that variation in social and/or environmental complexity yields variation in selective pressures on brain anatomy, where more complex brains should yield increased intelligence. While these insights are based on many evolutionary studies, it remains unclear how ecology impacts brain plasticity and subsequently cognitive performance within a species. Here, we show that in wild cleaner fish (Labroides dimidiatus), forebrain size of high-performing individuals tested in an ephemeral reward task covaried positively with cleaner density, while cerebellum size covaried negatively with cleaner density. This unexpected relationship may be explained if we consider that performance in this task reflects the decision rules that individuals use in nature rather than learning abilities: cleaners with relatively larger forebrains used decision-rules that appeared to be locally optimal. Thus, social competence seems to be a suitable proxy of intelligence to understand individual differences under natural conditions.", "The military is interested in identifying factors to improve the readiness of service members with traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI outcome studies have primarily used objective neuropsychological data interpreted using the absolute level of functioning (i.e., high average, average, low average), though research suggests it is also important to consider other objective indices of the relative degree of decline (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) and subjective complaints. The current study determined the predictive ability of objective indices of neuropsychological functioning (i.e., absolute level and the relative degree of decline) and subjective complaints (i.e., Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory) in terms of military work status (i.e., return to duty, medically disabled, retired) for 113 service members with mild TBI. ANOVAs and post-hoc tests indicated individuals who were able to return to duty had higher absolute indices and lower relative decline scores in working memory and overall intelligence, as well as lower subjective neuropsychological complaints when compared to those who were disabled or retired. Multinomial logistic regression models generally supported these findings, except relative decline scores were not predictive of military work status likely due to issues of collinearity (i.e., relative decline scores are calculated using absolute scores). In conclusion, indices of absolute functioning and subjective neuropsychological impairments appear to be predictors of the ability to return to duty post-TBI in military populations, emphasizing the need to focus on cognitive reserve and emotional resilience as potential interventions.", "With the popularity of smart wearable systems, sensor signal processing poses more challenges to machine learning in embedded scenarios. For example, traditional machine-learning methods for data classification, especially in real time, are computationally intensive. The deployment of Artificial Intelligence algorithms on embedded hardware for fast data classification and accurate fall detection poses a huge challenge in achieving power-efficient embedded systems. Therefore, by exploiting the associative memory feature of Hopfield Neural Network, a hardware module has been designed to simulate the Neural Network algorithm which uses sensor data integration and data classification for recognizing the fall. By adopting the Hebbian learning method for training neural networks, weights of human activity features are obtained and implemented/embedded into the hardware design. Here, the neural network weight of fall activity is achieved through data preprocessing, and then the weight is mapped to the amplification factor setting in the hardware. The designs are checked with validation scenarios, and the experiment is completed with a Hopfield neural network in the analog module. Through simulations, the classification accuracy of the fall data reached 88.9% which compares well with some other results achieved by the software-based machine-learning algorithms, which verify the feasibility of our hardware design. The designed system performs the complex signal calculations of the hardware's feedback signal, replacing the software-based method. A straightforward circuit design is used to meet the weight setting from the Hopfield neural network, which is maximizing the reusability and flexibility of the circuit design.", "The modern food supply faces many challenges. The global population continues to grow and people are becoming wealthier, so the food production system must respond by creating enough high-quality food to feed everyone with minimal damage to our environment. The number of people suffering or dying from diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, continues to rise, which is partly linked to overconsumption of highly processed foods, especially high-calorie or rapidly digestible foods. After falling for many years, the number of people suffering from starvation or malnutrition is rising, and thishas been exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The highly integrated food supply chains that spread around the world are susceptible to disruptions due to policy changes, economic stresses, and natural disasters, as highlighted by the recent pandemic. In this perspective article, written by members of the Editorial Committee of the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, we highlight some of the major challenges confronting the modern food supply chain as well as how innovations in policy and technology can be used to address them. Pertinent technological innovations include robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced diagnostics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, gene editing, vertical farming, and soft matter physics. Many of these technologies are already being employed across the food chain by farmers, distributors, manufacturers, and consumers to improve the quality, nutrition, safety, and sustainability of the food supply. These innovations are required to stimulate the development and implementation of new technologies to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and efficient food production system. Where appropriate, these technologies should be carefully tested before widespread implementation so that proper risk-benefit analyses can be carried out. They can then be employed without causing unforeseen adverse consequences. Finally, it is important to actively engage all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain throughout the development and testing of these new technologies to support their adoption if proven safe and effective.", "Wearable human sweat sensors have offered a great prospect in epidermal detection for self-monitoring and health evaluation. These on-body epidermal sensors can be integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) as augmented diagnostics tools for telehealth applications, especially for noninvasive health monitoring without using blood contents. One of many great benefits in utilizing sweat as biofluid is the capability of instantaneously continuous diagnosis during normal day-to-day activities. Here, we revealed a textile-based sweat sensor selective for perspired creatinine that is prepared by coating poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-Cu2+-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and cuprous oxide nanoparticles on stretchable nylon, is equipped with heart rate monitoring and a satellite-communication device to locate wearers, and incorporates machine learning to predict the levels of environmental heat stress. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate different charge-transfer resistances of PVA and PEDOT:PSS with cuprous and cuprite ions induced by single-chain and ionic cross-linking. Furthermore, density function theory (DFT) studies predicted the catalytic binding of sweat creatinine with the sensing materials that occurred at thiophene rings. The hybrid sensor successfully achieved 96.3% selectivity efficacy toward the determination of creatinine contents from 0.4 to 960 \u03bcM in the presence of interfering species of glucose, urea, uric acid, and NaCl as well as retained 92.1% selectivity efficacy in the existence of unspecified human sweat interference. Ultimately, the hand-grip portable device can offer the great benefit of continuous health monitoring and provide the location of any wearer. This augmented telemedicine sensor may represent the first remote low-cost and artificial-intelligence-based sensing device selective for heat-stress sweat creatinine.", "A recent report of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) points out an insufficient number of physicians in Europe. The issue seems especially relevant in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, based on papers found in the PubMed database, we drew on the available information on the aspects of medical education and terms and rate of employment of physicians to submit potential solutions of how to increase the availability of physicians in Europe. We offer the following improvements in tackling the issue: (i) standardization of the method of verification of the number of physicians in practice for a meaningful comparison between European states; (ii) managerial reorganization of medical education to increase the flexibility of teaching; (iii) education shortening, e.g., to 4\u00a0years, for nurses, paramedics, and the like; (iv) circumscription of unnecessary health records and the use of artificial intelligence to streamline the recording system to ease the burden on the medical staff.", "The future of artificial intelligence (AI) heralds unprecedented change for the field of radiation oncology. Commercial vendors and academic institutions have created AI tools for radiation oncology, but such tools have not yet been widely adopted into clinical practice. In addition, numerous discussions have prompted careful thoughts about AI's impact upon the future landscape of radiation oncology: How can we preserve innovation, creativity, and patient safety? When will AI-based tools be widely adopted into the clinic? Will the need for clinical staff be reduced? How will these devices and tools be developed and regulated?\nIn this work, we examine how deep learning, a rapidly emerging subset of AI, fits into the broader historical context of advancements made in radiation oncology and medical physics. In addition, we examine a representative set of deep learning-based tools that are being made available for use in external beam radiotherapy treatment planning and how these deep learning-based tools and other AI-based tools will impact members of the radiation treatment planning team. Key Messages: Compared to past transformative innovations explored in this article, such as the Monte Carlo method or intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the development and adoption of deep learning-based tools is occurring at faster rates and promises to transform practices of the radiation treatment planning team. However, accessibility to these tools will be determined by each clinic's access to the internet, web-based solutions, or high-performance computing hardware. As seen by the trends exhibited by many technologies, high dependence on new technology can result in harm should the product fail in an unexpected manner, be misused by the operator, or if the mitigation to an expected failure is not adequate. Thus, the need for developers and researchers to rigorously validate deep learning-based tools, for users to understand how to operate tools appropriately, and for professional bodies to develop guidelines for their use and maintenance is essential. Given that members of the radiation treatment planning team perform many tasks that are automatable, the use of deep learning-based tools, in combination with other automated treatment planning tools, may refocus tasks performed by the treatment planning team and may potentially reduce resource-related burdens for clinics with limited resources.", "In recent years, chip design technology and AI (artificial intelligence) have made significant progress. This forces all of fields to investigate how to increase the competitiveness of products with machine learning technology. In this work, we mainly use deep learning coupled with motor control to realize the real-time interactive system of air hockey, and to verify the feasibility of machine learning in the real-time interactive system. In particular, we use the convolutional neural network YOLO (\"you only look once\") to capture the hockey current position. At the same time, the law of reflection and neural networking are applied to predict the end position of the puck Based on the predicted location, the system will control the stepping motor to move the linear slide to realize the real-time interactive air hockey system. Finally, we discuss and verify the accuracy of the prediction of the puck end position and improve the system response time to meet the system requirements.", "Technology is bringing about a revolution in every field and mental health care is no exception. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has provided us with both a need and an opportunity to use technology as means to improve access to mental health care. Hence, it is imperative to expand and harness the tremendous potential of telepsychiatry by expanding the scope of its applications and the future possibilities. In this article, we explore the different avenues in digital innovation that is revolutionizing the practice in psychiatry like mental health applications, artificial intelligence, e-portals, and technology leveraging for building capacity. Also, we have also visualized what the future has in store for our practice of psychiatry, considering how rapid technological advances can occur and how these advances will impact us. There will be challenges on the road ahead, especially for a country like India for instance; the digital divide, lack of knowledge to utilize the available technology and the need for a quality control and regulation. However, it is safe to presume that telepsychiatry will evolve and progress beyond these roadblocks and will fulfill its role in transforming health care. Telepsychiatry will improve the health care capacity to interact with patients and family. The blurring of national and international borders will also open international opportunities to psychiatrist in India, heralding a new wave of virtual health tourism.", "Antipsychotics are frequently prescribed to children and adolescents for nonpsychotic indications. Guidelines recommend regularly assessing treatment response and adverse effects and the ongoing need for their use. We aimed to assess adherence to recommendations of available guidelines regarding monitoring antipsychotic use and to test the influence of children's age, sex, intelligence quotient, and diagnosis on adherence.\nWe reviewed 426 medical records from 26 centers within 3 large Dutch child and adolescent psychiatry organizations, excluding children with schizophrenia, psychosis, mania, or an intelligence quotient below 70. We investigated whether there was regular assessment of treatment response, adverse events (physical and laboratory), and at least annual discussion of the need of continued use.\nOn average, treatment response was assessed in 69.3% of the recommended treatment periods, height in 25.6%, weight in 30.6%, blood pressure in 20.6%, evaluation of adverse events in 19.4%, and cardiometabolic measures in 13.7%; discontinuation and/or continued need was discussed at least annually in 36.2%. Extrapyramidal and prolactin-related adverse effects, waist circumference, glucose, and lipids were rarely investigated. Higher age was associated with lower rates of assessment of treatment response. Most antipsychotics were prescribed long-term. In those children with sufficient documentation of the course of treatment, 57.7% was still using an antipsychotic 3 years after initiation.\nOur findings indicate insufficient adherence to guideline recommendations for monitoring antipsychotic use in children and adolescents, as well as long duration of use in the majority of children. Especially, older children are at higher risk of receiving suboptimal care.", "This single-center study was approved by the institutional review board. Artificial intelligence-based FS MRI scans were created from non-FS images using a deep learning system with a modified convolutional neural network-based U-Net that used a training set of 25,920 images and validation set of 16,416 images. Three musculoskeletal radiologists reviewed 88 knee MR studies in 2 sessions, the original (proton density [PD] + FSPD) and the synthetic (PD + AFSMRI). Readers recorded AFSMRI quality (diagnostic/nondiagnostic) and the presence or absence of meniscal, ligament, and tendon tears; cartilage defects; and bone marrow abnormalities. Contrast-to-noise rate measurements were made among subcutaneous fat, fluid, bone marrow, cartilage, and muscle. The original MRI sequences were used as the reference standard to determine the diagnostic performance of AFSMRI (combined with the original PD sequence). This is a fully balanced study design, where all readers read all images the same number of times, which allowed the determination of the interchangeability of the original and synthetic protocols. Descriptive statistics, intermethod agreement, interobserver concordance, and interchangeability tests were applied. A P value less than 0.01 was considered statistically significant for the likelihood ratio testing, and P value less than 0.05 for all other statistical analyses.\nArtificial intelligence-based FS MRI quality was rated as diagnostic (98.9% [87/88] to 100% [88/88], all readers). Diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity) of the synthetic protocol was high, for tears of the menisci (91% [71/78], 86% [84/98]), cruciate ligaments (92% [12/13], 98% [160/163]), collateral ligaments (80% [16/20], 100% [156/156]), and tendons (90% [9/10], 100% [166/166]). For cartilage defects and bone marrow abnormalities, the synthetic protocol offered an overall sensitivity/specificity of 77% (170/221)/93% (287/307) and 76% (95/125)/90% (443/491), respectively. Intermethod agreement ranged from moderate to substantial for almost all evaluated structures (menisci, cruciate ligaments, collateral ligaments, and bone marrow abnormalities). No significant difference was observed between methods for all structural abnormalities by all readers (P > 0.05), except for cartilage assessment. Interobserver agreement ranged from moderate to substantial for almost all evaluated structures. Original and synthetic protocols were interchangeable for the diagnosis of all evaluated structures. There was no significant difference for the common exact match proportions for all combinations (P > 0.01). The conspicuity of all tissues assessed through contrast-to-noise rate was higher on AFSMRI than on original FSPD images (P < 0.05).\nArtificial intelligence-based FS MRI (3D AFSMRI) is feasible and offers a method for fast imaging, with similar detection rates for structural abnormalities of the knee, compared with original 3D MR sequences.", "Exposure to certain intrauterine antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can negatively influence the language skills and intelligence of young children. It remains unanswered whether these deficits are transient or persist as children grow up. This study aims to evaluate the language function of children of women with epilepsy (CWE) aged 9-13\u00a0years in comparison with their peers, and its relationship with intrauterine AED exposure.\nWe included 191 CWE in our study from the Kerala Registry of Epilepsy and Pregnancy. Children in the same age group (n\u00a0=\u00a0144) and without maternal epilepsy or antenatal AED exposure served as controls. We used Clinical Examination for Language Function version IV to assess language in both groups. Relevant data related to maternal epilepsy and AED use were obtained from the registry records.\nThe average Core Language Scaled Score (CLSS) was significantly lower in CWE as compared to controls (83.19 vs 90.18, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). Similarly, the mean scaled scores in other language parameters were also significantly lower in CWE. In the multivariate analysis, compared to control children, the average CLSS in CWE was 4.5 units lower (95% confidence interval [CI] = -8.8 to -0.2, P\u00a0=\u00a0.04) with AED monotherapy exposure and 7.3 units lower with exposure to AED polytherapy (95% CI = -13.8 to -0.8, P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). Intrauterine exposure to phenobarbitone (n\u00a0=\u00a061) and valproate (n\u00a0=\u00a055) as either monotherapy or polytherapy showed a negative effect on CLSS in CWE as compared to control children. However, carbamazepine (n\u00a0=\u00a075) and phenytoin (n\u00a0=\u00a037) use was not associated with significant variation of CLSS. In head-to-head comparisons between AED monotherapies in CWE, phenobarbitone showed a negative effect on CLSS (-14.7, 95% CI = -23.1 to -6.4, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001) as compared to carbamazepine.\nIntrauterine exposure to phenobarbitone and valproate impairs language development in CWE, with effects persisting into the second decade.", "Emotional management is a decisive factor in building stimulating environments for the comprehensive development of individuals. In this study, 338 students enrolled in education degrees (n = 338), with an average age of 22.88 years (\u00b15.50), participated. The following instruments were used: Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEI-S), Trait Meta Mood Scale 24 (TMMS 24) and Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQi-C). The objective was to determine the complementarity of certain dimensions of EI that predict greater life satisfaction based on the multivariate statistics of structural equations. The multi-group model obtained good structural validity (\u03c72 = 103,729; RMSEA = 0.078; GFI = 0.917; CFI = 0.942; IFI = 0.943). In addition, significant correlations were found between life satisfaction and all dimensions were included in the emotional intelligence instruments used (p < 0.01). In terms of gender, we found that women had higher scores in all EI dimensions, in contrast to life satisfaction, where men had higher scores. The findings suggest the importance of working emotions in future educators to become satisfied and effective professionals.", "Over the past decade, a brand-new pressure- and tactile-sensing modality, known as iontronic sensing has emerged, utilizing the supercapacitive nature of the electrical double layer (EDL) that occurs at the electrolytic-electronic interface, leading to ultrahigh device sensitivity, high noise immunity, high resolution, high spatial definition, optical transparency, and responses to both static and dynamic stimuli, in addition to thin and flexible device architectures. Together, it offers unique combination of enabling features to tackle the grand challenges in pressure- and tactile-sensing applications, in particular, with recent interest and rapid progress in the development of robotic intelligence, electronic skin, wearable health as well as the internet-of-things, from both academic and industrial communities. A historical perspective of the iontronic sensing discovery, an overview of the fundamental working mechanism along with its device architectures, a survey of the unique material aspects and structural designs dedicated, and finally, a discussion of the newly enabled applications, technical challenges, and future outlooks are provided for this promising sensing modality with implementations. The state-of-the-art developments of the iontronic sensing technology in its first decade are summarized, potentially providing a technical roadmap for the next wave of innovations and breakthroughs in this field.", "To describe the immediate consequences of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic on the ocular surface and eye-care professionals, and to discuss the need for a mandatory switch from currently performed tele-screening to true teleconsultation for remote ocular surface assessment.\nOphthalmologists have been largely impacted by the COVID-19 sanitary crisis, due to both the ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and to the high contagiousness of the virus. The proximity of ophthalmologists to their patients have pushed eye-care providers to readapt their practices and develop alternatives to face-to-face consultations. However, teleconsultation has some major limitations and drawbacks, especially for ocular surface assessment that relies on high-quality graphic data for adequate diagnosis. Tele-screening, on the other hand, emphasizes on the importance of history-taking and listening to the patient in order to adequately prioritize appointments based on the presumed degree of emergency.\nDespite all the enthusiasm, tele-screening as currently performed with the available tools is still not capable of completely replacing a standard ophthalmic examination for the assessment of ocular surface diseases. While waiting for new emerging technologies and future implementation of imaging modalities and artificial intelligence, decision making algorithms can help eye-practitioners remotely screen their patients to assess the optimal time for follow-up appointments.", "In the real world, medical practice is changing hand in hand with the development of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and problems from different areas have been successfully solved using AI algorithms. Specifically, the use of AI techniques in setting up or building precision medicine is significant in terms of the accuracy of disease discovery and tailored treatment. Moreover, with the use of technology, clinical personnel can deliver a very much efficient healthcare service.\nThis article reviews AI state-of-the-art in cardiovascular disease management, focusing on diagnostic and therapeutic improvements.\nTo that end, we conducted a detailed PubMed search on AI application from distinct areas of cardiology: heart failure, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, syncope and cardiovascular rehabilitation. Particularly, to assess the impact of these technologies in clinical decision-making, this research considers technical and medical aspects.\nOn one hand, some devices in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and cardiac rehabilitation represent an inexpensive, not invasive or not very invasive approach to long-term surveillance and management in these areas. On the other hand, the availability of large datasets (big data) is a useful tool to predict the development and outcome of many cardiovascular diseases. In summary, with this new guided therapy, the physician can supply prompt, individualised, and tailored treatment and the patients feel safe as they are continuously monitored, with a significant psychological effect.\nSoon, tailored patient care via telemonitoring can improve clinical practice because AI-based systems support cardiologists in daily medical activities, improving disease detection and treatment. However, the physician-patient relationship remains a pivotal step.", "Robotization and artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to change societies profoundly. Trust is an important factor of human-technology interactions, as robots and AI increasingly contribute to tasks previously handled by humans. Currently, there is a need for studies investigating trust toward AI and robots, especially in first-encounter meetings. This article reports findings from a study investigating trust toward robots and AI in an online trust game experiment. The trust game manipulated the hypothetical opponents that were described as either AI or robots. These were compared with control group opponents using only a human name or a nickname. Participants (N = 1077) lived in the United States. Describing opponents with robots or AI did not impact participants' trust toward them. The robot called jdrx894 was the most trusted opponent. Opponents named \"jdrx894\" were trusted more than opponents called \"Michael.\" Further analysis showed that having a degree in technology or engineering, exposure to robots online and robot use self-efficacy predicted higher trust toward robots and AI. Out of Big Five personality characteristics, openness to experience predicted higher trust, and conscientiousness predicted lower trust. Results suggest trust on robots and AI is contextual and it is also dependent on individual differences and knowledge on technology.", "Central nervous system disorders remain the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, affecting more than 1 billion patients. This therapeutic area suffers from high unmet medical needs and the search for innovative approaches to identify therapeutic strategies is urgent in the field. This review will first cover the challenges and opportunities of drug discovery in neurology, and then as well as the new models, such as human model stem cells and animal models under development in the field. In addition, innovative and translational neuroimaging techniques will be discussed, as the use of big data and artificial intelligence to discovery new drugs in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.", "Women with epilepsy (WWE) and their care providers are equally concerned about the risk of seizures and adverse effects of using antiepileptic drugs (AED) during pregnancy to the mother and the baby. The risk of death or other complications during the pregnancy period is high when WWE continue to have seizures. Antenatal exposure to valproate and several other AEDs as monotherapy and polytherapy is associated with a higher risk of Major Congenital Malformations (MCM). The risk of MCM is dose dependent for valproate and several other AEDs. Children who were exposed to AEDs in the antenatal period demonstrate impaired intelligence and language functions when examined in early childhood, and this effect endures into the second decade of life also. There is considerable difficulty in communicating the complexities of the benefits and risks of using AEDs during the preconception period and pregnancy to the women and their relatives. In this technical note, we are presenting the grid-based preconception counseling of the risk and benefits of different treatment options to facilitate shared decision making. The clinician elicits the preferences and concerns of WWE in the first column of the grid. The potential outcomes of different treatment options concerning these preferences and concerns are presented in the remaining columns of the grid so that a shared decision can be reached. This option grid provides an opportunity to the WWE to review the options holistically and make appropriate decisions.", "We present the hypothesis to the scientific community actively designing clinical trials and recommending public health guidelines to control the pandemic that - \"Tetanus vaccination may be contributing to reduced severity of the COVID-19 infection\" - and urge further research to validate or invalidate the effectiveness of the tetanus toxoid vaccine against COVID-19. This hypothesis was revealed by an explainable artificial intelligence system unleashed on open public biomedical datasets. As a foundation for scientific rigor, we describe the data and the artificial intelligence system, document the provenance and methodology used to derive the hypothesis and also gather potentially relevant data/evidence from recent studies. We conclude that while correlations may not be reason for causation, correlations from multiple sources is more than a serendipitous coincidence that is worthy of further and deeper investigation.", "Online analytical processing (OLAP) approach is widely used in business intelligence to cater the multidimensional queries for decades. In this era of cutting-edge technology and the internet, data generation rates have been rising exponentially. Internet of things sensors and social media platforms are some of the major contributors, leading toward the absolute data boom. Storage and speed are the crucial parameters and undoubtedly the burning issues in efficient data handling. The key idea here is to address these two challenges of big data computing in OLAP. In this article, the authors have proposed and implemented OLAP on Hadoop by Indexing (OOHI). OOHI offers a simplified multidimensional model that stores dimensions in the schema server and measures on the Hadoop cluster. Overall setup is divided into various modules, namely: data storage module (DSM), dimension encoding module (DEM), cube segmentation module, segment selection module (SSM), and block selection and process (BSAP) module. Serialization and deserialization concept applied by DSM for storage and retrieval of the data for efficient space utilization. Integer encoding adopted by DEM in dimension hierarchy is selected to escape sparsity problem in multidimensional big data. To reduce search space by chunks of the cube from the queried chunks, SSM plays an important role. Map reduce-based indexing approach and series of seek operations of BSAP module were integrated to achieve parallelism and fault tolerance. Real-time oceanography data and supermarket data sets are applied to demonstrate that OOHI model is data independent. Various test cases are designed to cover the scope of each dimension and volume of data set. Comparative results and performance analytics portray that OOHI outperforms in data storage, dice, slice, and roll-up operations compared with Hadoop based OLAP.", "Integrative medicine is a form of medicine that combines practices and treatments from alternative medicine with conventional medicine. The diagnosis in integrative medicine involves the clinical diagnosis based on modern medicine and syndrome pattern diagnosis. Electronic medical records (EMRs) are the systematized collection of patients health information stored in a digital format that can be shared across different health care settings. Although syndrome and sign information or relative information can be extracted from the EMR and content texts can be mapped to computability vectors using natural language processing techniques, application of artificial intelligence techniques to support physicians in medical practices remains a major challenge.\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate model-based reasoning (MBR) algorithms for the clinical diagnosis in integrative medicine based on EMRs and natural language processing. We also estimated the associations among the factors of sample size, number of syndrome pattern type, and diagnosis in modern medicine using the MBR algorithms.\nA total of 14,075 medical records of clinical cases were extracted from the EMRs as the development data set, and an external test data set consisting of 1000 medical records of clinical cases was extracted from independent EMRs. MBR methods based on word embedding, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms were developed for the automatic diagnosis of syndrome pattern in integrative medicine. MBR algorithms combining rule-based reasoning (RBR) were also developed. A standard evaluation metrics consisting of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score was used for the performance estimation of the methods. The association analyses were conducted on the sample size, number of syndrome pattern type, and diagnosis of lung diseases with the best algorithms.\nThe Word2Vec convolutional neural network (CNN) MBR algorithms showed high performance (accuracy of 0.9586 in the test data set) in the syndrome pattern diagnosis of lung diseases. The Word2Vec CNN MBR combined with RBR also showed high performance (accuracy of 0.9229 in the test data set). The diagnosis of lung diseases could enhance the performance of the Word2Vec CNN MBR algorithms. Each group sample size and syndrome pattern type affected the performance of these algorithms.\nThe MBR methods based on Word2Vec and CNN showed high performance in the syndrome pattern diagnosis of lung diseases in integrative medicine. The parameters of each group's sample size, syndrome pattern type, and diagnosis of lung diseases were associated with the performance of the methods.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03274908; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03274908.", "The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence (AI) application evaluating of the impacted third molar teeth in Cone-beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images.\nIn total, 130 third molar teeth (65 patients) were included in this retrospective study. Impaction detection, Impacted tooth numbers, root/canal numbers of teeth, relationship with adjacent anatomical structures (inferior alveolar canal and maxillary sinus) were compared between the human observer and AI application. Recorded parameters agreement between the human observer and AI application based on the deep-CNN system was evaluated using the Kappa analysis.\nIn total, 112 teeth (86.2%) were detected as impacted by AI. The number of roots was correctly determined in 99 teeth (78.6%) and the number of canals in 82 teeth (68.1%). There was a good agreement in the determination of the inferior alveolar canal in relation to the mandibular impacted third molars (kappa: 0.762) as well as the number of roots detection (kappa: 0.620). Similarly, there was an excellent agreement in relation to maxillary impacted third molar and the maxillary sinus (kappa: 0.860). For the maxillary molar canal number detection, a moderate agreement was found between the human observer and AI examinations (kappa: 0.424).\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) application showed high accuracy values in the detection of impacted third molar teeth and their relationship to anatomical structures.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to fundamentally change medicine within the coming decades. Radiological imaging is one of the primary fields of its clinical application.\nIn this article, we summarize previous AI developments with a\u00a0focus on oncological radiology.

Building and using AI applications are becoming increasingly accessible. However, complex use cases may still require specialized expertise for design and deployment. AI has many applications in dermatology ranging from fundamental research, diagnostics, therapeutics, and cosmetic dermatology. The lack of standardization of images and privacy concerns are the foremost challenges stifling AI adoption. Dermatologists have a significant role to play in standardized data collection, curating data for machine learning, clinically validating AI solutions, and ultimately adopting this paradigm shift that is changing the way we practice.", "It is unclear if pediatric executive dysfunction assessed only with cognitive tasks predicts clinically relevant outcomes independently of psychiatric diagnoses. This study tested the stability and validity of a task-based classification of executive function.\nA total of 2,207 individuals (6-17 years old) from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort Study participated in this study (1,930 at baseline, 1,532 at follow-up). Executive function was measured using tests of working memory and inhibitory control. Dichotomized age- and sex-standardized performances were used as input in latent class analysis and receiver operating curves to create an executive dysfunction classification (EDC). The study tested EDC's stability over time, association with symptoms, functional impairment, a polymorphism in the CADM2 gene, polygenic risk scores (PRS), and brain structure. Analyses covaried for age, sex, social class, IQ, and psychiatric diagnoses.\nEDC at baseline predicted itself at follow-up (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0= 5.11; 95% CI 3.41-7.64). Participants in the EDC reported symptoms spanning several domains of psychopathology and exhibited impairment in multiple settings, including more adverse school events (OR\u00a0= 2.530; 95% CI 1.838-3.483). Children in the EDC presented higher attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and lower educational attainment PRS at baseline; higher schizophrenia PRS at follow-up; and lower chances of presenting a polymorphism in a gene previously linked to high performance in executive function (CADM2 gene). They also exhibited smaller intracranial volumes and smaller bilateral cortical surface areas in several brain regions.\nTask-based executive dysfunction is associated with several validators, independently of psychiatric diagnoses and intelligence. Further refinement of task-based assessments might generate clinically useful tools.", "Studies that investigate cognitive ability in African children and estimate the general cognitive abilities of African adults tend to work with existing models of intelligence. However, African philosophy and empirical studies in cross-cultural psychology have demonstrated that conceptualizations of human cognitive ability vary with location. This paper begins with the assumption that the existing Anglo-American models of cognitive abilities are valuable but limited in their capacity to account for the various conceptualizations of valued cognitive abilities in different human societies. On the basis of this assumption, I employ extant empirical evidence generated through ethnographic studies across Africa to formulate what an African model of valued human cognitive ability ought to be. The output of this formulation has been so christened a model of valued cognitive ability in order to draw attention to the fact that models of cognitive abilities have currency and values in each human society. This value allocation is expected to influence which elements of cognitive ability each human society will promote and develop. In addition, implications for theory, research and praxes are discussed.", "The oral ecosystem is shaped by complex interactions between systemic health disease and the resident oral microbiota. Research in the last two decades has produced datasets describing the genetics and physiology of the host and the oral microbiome in health and disease. There are inter-individual differences in the ability to tolerate oral disease-promoting challenges. Identification of the key factors that drive a healthy and resilient oral ecosystem is urgently needed. So far, progress is being made towards replicating the host-microbiota interplay in vitro. Clinical studies may shed light on the mechanisms of oral health resilience. However, most clinical studies are cross-sectional and are insufficient for understanding resilience or for identifying biomarkers that correlate with the point of transition from oral health to dysbiosis. Mathematical and computational models, including artificial intelligence approaches, offer an opportunity to inform the design of clinical studies by identifying key biomarkers and interaction networks in complex datasets and predicting important parameters. This paper discusses some of the challenges and opportunities for understanding the biological basis of resilience of the oral ecosystem. It discusses the current status and challenges, and proposes a way forward to better understand resilience towards oral diseases.", "Improving wastewater treatment processes is becoming increasingly important, due to more stringent effluent quality requirements, the need to reduce energy consumption and chemical dosing. This can be achieved by applying artificial intelligence. Machine learning is implemented in two domains: (1) predictive control and (2) advanced analytics. This is currently being piloted at the integrated validation plant of PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency. (1) Primarily, predictive control is applied for optimised nutrient removal. This is obtained by application of a self-learning feedforward algorithm, which uses load prediction and machine learning, fine-tuned with feedback on ammonium effluent. Operational results with predictive control show that the load prediction has an accuracy of \u224888%. It is also shown that an up to \u224815% reduction of aeration amount is achieved compared to conventional control. It is proven that this load prediction-based control leads to stable operation and meeting effluent quality requirements as an autopilot system. (2) Additionally, advanced analytics are being developed for operational support. This is obtained by application of quantile regression neural network modelling for anomaly detection. Preliminary results illustrate the ability to autodetect process and instrument anomalies. These can be used as early warnings to deliver data-driven operational support to process operators.", "The ability of artificial agents to increment their capabilities when confronted with new data is an open challenge in artificial intelligence. The main challenge faced in such cases is catastrophic forgetting, i.e., the tendency of neural networks to underfit past data when new ones are ingested. A first group of approaches tackles forgetting by increasing deep model capacity to accommodate new knowledge. A second type of approaches fix the deep model size and introduce a mechanism whose objective is to ensure a good compromise between stability and plasticity of the model. While the first type of algorithms were compared thoroughly, this is not the case for methods which exploit a fixed size model. Here, we focus on the latter, place them in a common conceptual and experimental framework and propose the following contributions: (1) define six desirable properties of incremental learning algorithms and analyze them according to these properties, (2) introduce a unified formalization of the class-incremental learning problem, (3) propose a common evaluation framework which is more thorough than existing ones in terms of number of datasets, size of datasets, size of bounded memory and number of incremental states, (4) investigate the usefulness of herding for past exemplars selection, (5) provide experimental evidence that it is possible to obtain competitive performance without the use of knowledge distillation to tackle catastrophic forgetting and (6) facilitate reproducibility by integrating all tested methods in a common open-source repository. The main experimental finding is that none of the existing algorithms achieves the best results in all evaluated settings. Important differences arise notably if a bounded memory of past classes is allowed or not.", "Millions of children globally are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential because of early adversities. We hypothesised that responsive caregiving and learning opportunities, components of nurturing care, at pre-school ages might mitigate the effects of adversities.\nWe analysed longitudinal birth cohort data from Brazil (1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort, n=632) and South Africa (Birth to Twenty Plus [Bt20+] Birth Cohort, n=1130) to assess whether responsive caregiving and learning opportunities at pre-school ages (2-4 years) modified associations between cumulative early adversities and adolescent human capital. The cumulative adversities score (range 0-9) included household wealth and crowding; mothers' schooling, height, age, and mental health; and children's birthweight, gestational age, and length at age 12 months. We extracted data on responsive caregiving and learning opportunities from the Early Childhood Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment inventory, assessed at age 4 years (1993 Pelotas cohort) and 2 years (Bt20+ cohort). We examined three human capital indicators: intelligence quotient (IQ) assessed at age 18 years (1993 Pelotas cohort) and 16 years (Bt20+ cohort); psychosocial adjustment assessed at age 15 years and 14 years, respectively; and height assessed at age 18 years and 16 years, respectively. We used linear models with interaction terms between cumulative adversities, and responsive caregiving and learning opportunities, to predict adolescent human capital.\nFor each additional Z score of total cumulative adversity, adolescent IQ decreased by 5\u00b789 (95% CI -7\u00b729 to -4\u00b750) points in the 1993 Pelotas cohort (p<0\u00b70001) and 2\u00b769 (-4\u00b752 to -0\u00b786) points in the Bt20+ cohort (p=0\u00b70039). After adjusting for total cumulative adversities, adolescent IQ points increased by 5\u00b747 (95% CI 4\u00b720 to 6\u00b774) with each additional Z score of learning opportunities and by 2\u00b726 (0\u00b793 to 3\u00b759) with each additional Z score of responsive caregiving in the 1993 Pelotas cohort, but not in the Bt20+ cohort (0\u00b786 [-0\u00b712 to 1\u00b783] and 0\u00b765 [-0\u00b732 to 1\u00b761], respectively). Associations between early adversities and IQ were modified by learning opportunities in the 1993 Pelotas cohort (beta coefficient for interaction 1\u00b774, 95% CI 0\u00b743 to 3\u00b704; p=0\u00b70092) and by responsive caregiving in the Bt20+ cohort (2\u00b724, 0\u00b794 to 3\u00b754; p=0\u00b70075). High nurturing environment attenuated the negative effects of early cumulative adversities on IQ.\nEarly nurturing home environments protect young children against effects of early adversities on adolescent IQ, with long-term positive associations on adolescent cognition in two middle-income countries.\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation.", "A nanofluid containing water and nanoparticles made of copper (Cu) inside a cavity with square shape is simulated utilizing the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The nanoparticles made up 15% of the nanofluid. By performing the simulation, the CFD output is characterized by the coordinates in the x, y, nanofluid temperature, and velocity in the y-direction that these outputs are obtained for different physical time iterations. Moreover, the CFD outputs are examined by one of the artificial techniques, i.e. adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). For this purpose, the data was clustered via grid partition clustering, and the type of membership functions (MFs) was chosen product of two sigmoidal membership functions (psigmf). After reaching 99.9% of intelligence in ANFIS, the nanofluid temperature is predicted for the entire data, which are included in the learning processes. The results showed that the method of ANFIS can predict the thermal properties in different physical times at different computing points without having a training background at those times. Additionally, this study shows that with three membership functions at each input, the model's accuracy is higher than four functions.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly of tremendous interest in the medical field. How-ever, failures of medical AI could have serious consequences for both clinical outcomes and the patient experience. These consequences could erode public trust in AI, which could in turn undermine trust in our healthcare institutions. This article makes 2 contributions. First, it describes the major conceptual, technical, and humanistic challenges in medical AI. Second, it proposes a solution that hinges on the education and accreditation of new expert groups who specialize in the development, verification, and operation of medical AI technologies. These groups will be required to maintain trust in our healthcare institutions.", "Advancement of accurate models for predicting real estate price is of utmost importance for urban development and several critical economic functions. Due to the significant uncertainties and dynamic variables, modeling real estate has been studied as complex systems. In this study, a novel machine learning method is proposed to tackle real estate modeling complexity. Call detail records (CDR) provides excellent opportunities for in-depth investigation of the mobility characterization. This study explores the CDR potential for predicting the real estate price with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). Several essential mobility entropy factors, including dweller entropy, dweller gyration, workers' entropy, worker gyration, dwellers' work distance, and workers' home distance, are used as input variables. The prediction model is developed using the machine learning method of multi-layered perceptron (MLP) trained with the evolutionary algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO). Model performance is evaluated using mean square error (MSE), sustainability index (SI), and Willmott's index (WI). The proposed model showed promising results revealing that the workers' entropy and the dwellers' work distances directly influence the real estate price. However, the dweller gyration, dweller entropy, workers' gyration, and the workers' home had a minimum effect on the price. Furthermore, it is shown that the flow of activities and entropy of mobility are often associated with the regions with lower real estate prices.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subdiscipline of computer science that has made substantial progress in medicine and there is a growing body of AI research in dentistry. Dentists should have an understanding of the foundational concepts and the ability to critically evaluate dental research in AI. Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that most dental AI research is dedicated to. The most prolific area of ML research is automated interpretation of dental imaging. Other areas include providing treatment recommendations, predicting future disease and treatment outcomes. The research impact is limited by small datasets that do not harness the positive correlation between very large datasets and ML performance. There is also a need to standardize research methodologies and utilize performance metrics that are appropriate for the clinical context. In addition to research challenges, this article discusses the ethical, legal and logistical considerations associated with implementation in clinical practice. This includes explainable AI, model bias, data privacy and security. The future implications of AI in dentistry involve a promise for a novel form of practicing dentistry however, the effect of AI on patient outcomes is yet to be determined.", "Developing predictive intelligence in neuroscience for learning how to generate multimodal medical data from a single modality can improve neurological disorder diagnosis with minimal data acquisition resources. Existing deep learning frameworks are mainly tailored for images, which might fail in handling geometric data (e.g., brain graphs). Specifically, predicting a target brain graph from a single source brain graph remains largely unexplored. Solving such problem is generally challenged with domain fracturecaused by the difference in distribution between source and target domains. Besides, solving the prediction and domain fracture independently might not be optimal for both tasks. To address these challenges, we unprecedentedly propose a Learning-guided Graph Dual Adversarial Domain Alignment (LG-DADA) framework for predicting a target brain graph from a source brain graph. The proposed LG-DADA is grounded in three fundamental contributions: (1) a source data pre-clustering step using manifold learning to firstly handle source data heterogeneity and secondly circumvent mode collapse in generative adversarial learning, (2) a domain alignment of source domain to the target domain by adversarially learning their latent representations, and (3) a dual adversarial regularization that jointly learns a source embedding of training and testing brain graphs using two discriminators and predict the training target graphs. Results on morphological brain graphs synthesis showed that our method produces better prediction accuracy and visual quality as compared to other graph synthesis methods.", "Although many aspects of our lives have been transformed by digital innovation, widespread adoption of digital health advancements within the health care sector in general, and for hypertension care specifically, has been limited. However, it is likely that, over the next decade, material increases in the uptake of digital health innovations for hypertension care delivery will be seen. In this narrative review, we summarise those innovations thought to have the greatest chance for impact in the next decade. These include provision of virtual care combined with home blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring, use of digital registries and protocolised care, leveraging continuous BP measurement to collect vast amounts of individual and population-based BP data, and adoption of digital therapeutics to provide low-cost scalable interventions for patients with or at risk for hypertension. Of these, home BP telemonitoring is likely the most ready for implementation, but it needs to be done in a way that enables efficient guideline-concordant care in a cost-effective manner. In addition, efforts must be focused on implementing digital health solutions in a manner that addresses the major challenges to digital adoption. This entails ensuring that innovations are accessible, usable, secure, validated, evidence based, cost-effective, and integrated into the electronic systems that are already used by patients or providers. Increasing the use of broader digital innovations such as artificial/augmented intelligence, data analytics, and interactive voice response is also critically important. The digital revolution holds substantial promise, but success will depend on the ability of collaborative stakeholders to adopt and implement innovative, usable solutions.", "To explore and map the evidence for virtual reality and artificial intelligence in simulation for the provision of pain education for pre and post registration nurses.\nA scoping review of published and unpublished research from 2009 to 2019.\nNine electronic databases and hand-searching of reference lists.\nStudies were included if virtual reality or artificial intelligence interventions were used for education on pain care provision in nursing. Data were extracted and charted using an extraction tool and themes were explored using narrative analysis.\nThe review process resulted in the inclusion of four published studies. All studies used mixed methods and used artificial intelligence within clinical simulations as an intervention. No studies using virtual reality for pain education met the inclusion criteria. Participants of three studies were undergraduate nursing students in universities and participants in the fourth study were registered nurses within a hospital. Outcomes measured were user acceptance of the technology and feasibility in all studies. The context was hospital located and focused on acute pain episodes, with one exception being sickle cell pain. Three studies had adult patients and the other pediatric patients. The exclusion of input from a patient perspective was notable, as was a lack of interdisciplinary involvement.\nNurses are integral to the assessment and management of pain in many care settings requiring comprehensive communication and clinical skills. There is a paucity of research on the use of virtual reality or artificial intelligence in pain education for nurses. Current studies are preliminary in nature and/or pilot studies. Further empirical research, with robust design is required to inform nursing education, practice, and policy, thereby supporting the advancement of nursing pain education.", "A major challenge in the assisted reproduction laboratory is to set up reproducible and efficient criteria to identify the embryo with the highest developmental potential. Over the years, several methods have been used worldwide with this purpose. Initially, standard morphology assessment was the only available strategy. It is now universally recognized that besides being a very subjective embryo selection strategy, morphology evaluation alone has a very poor prognostic value. More recently, the availability of time-lapse incubators allowed a continuous monitoring of human embryo development. This technology has spread quickly and many fertility clinics over the world produced a remarkable amount of data. To date, however, a general consensus on which variables, or combination of variables, should play a central role in embryo selection is still lacking. Many confounding factors, concerning both patient features and clinical and biological procedures, have been observed to influence embryo development. In addition, several studies have reported unexpected positive outcomes, even in the presence of abnormal developmental criteria. While it does not seem that time-lapse technology is ready to entirely replace the more invasive preimplantation genetic testing in identifying the embryo with the highest implantation potential, it is certainly true that its application is rapidly growing, becoming progressively more accurate. Studies involving artificial intelligence and deep-learning models as well as combining morphokinetic with other non-invasive markers of embryo development, are currently ongoing, raising hopes for its successful applicability for clinical purpose in the near future. The present review mainly focuses on data published starting from the first decade of 2000, when time-lapse technology was introduced as a routine clinical practice in the infertility centers.", "In fluorosis-endemic areas, exposure to high levels of fluoride causes neurotoxicity such as lowered intelligence and cognitive impairment. Oxidative damage is critical to pathophysiologic processes of fluoride intoxication, and neurotoxicity of fluoride may be associated with oxidative stress. In previous studies, maize purple plant pigment (MPPP), which was rich in anthocyanins, showed a strong scavenging activity in vitro and in vivo. The present study aimed to determine whether treatment with MPPP can alleviate fluoride-induced oxidative damage in rat brain. After 3 months of experiment, brain tissues were assayed for oxidative stress variables, histological and Western blotting examinations. Our results showed that MPPP reduced the elevated malondialdehyde levels, increased superoxide dismutase activity, and further attenuated histopathological alterations and mitigated neuronal apoptosis. Importantly, MPPP also reversed changes in Bax and Bcl-2. Therefore, it was speculated that MPPP protects brain tissue from fluoride toxicity through its antioxidant capacity.", "As modern deep networks become more complex, and get closer to human-like capabilities in certain domains, the question arises as to how the representations and decision rules they learn compare to the ones in humans. In this work, we study representations of sentences in one such artificial system for natural language processing. We first present a diagnostic test dataset to examine the degree of abstract composable structure represented. Analyzing performance on these diagnostic tests indicates a lack of systematicity in representations and decision rules, and reveals a set of heuristic strategies. We then investigate the effect of training distribution on learning these heuristic strategies, and we study changes in these representations with various augmentations to the training set. Our results reveal parallels to the analogous representations in people. We find that these systems can learn abstract rules and generalize them to new contexts under certain circumstances-similar to human zero-shot reasoning. However, we also note some shortcomings in this generalization behavior-similar to human judgment errors like belief bias. Studying these parallels suggests new ways to understand psychological phenomena in humans as well as informs best strategies for building artificial intelligence with human-like language understanding.", "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B lymphoid malignancy highly dependent on the microenvironment. Despite new targeted therapies such as ibrutinib and venetoclax, disease progression and relapse remain an issue. CLL cell interactions with the supportive tissue microenvironment play a critical role in disease pathogenesis. We used a platform for drug discovery based on systems biology and artificial intelligence, to identify drugs targeting key proteins described to have a role in the microenvironment. The selected compounds were screened in CLL cell lines in the presence of stromal cells to mimic the microenvironment and validated the best candidates in primary CLL cells. Our results showed that the commercial drug simvastatin was the most effective and selective out of the tested compounds. Simvastatin decreased CLL cell survival and proliferation as well as cell adhesion. Importantly, this drug enhanced the antitumor effect of venetoclax and ibrutinib. We proposed that systems biology approaches combined with pharmacological screening could help to find new drugs for CLL treatment and to predict new combinations with current therapies. Our results highlight the possibility of repurposing widely used drugs such as statins to target the microenvironment and to improve the efficacy of ibrutinib or venetoclax in CLL cells.", "The increasing volume of biomedical data in chemistry and life sciences requires development of new methods and approaches for their analysis. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, especially neural networks, are increasingly used in the chemical industry, in particular with respect to Big Data. This editorial highlights the main results presented during the special session of the International Conference on Neural Networks organized by \"Big Data in Chemistry\" project and draws perspectives on the future progress of the field.", "Previous research has identified the main predictors of being a victim of school bullying. This study focused on the phenomenon of school bullying and its relationship with self-perceived emotional intelligence. The main aim was to analyze the mediating effect of emotional attention, clarity, and repair in relation to school victimization. The sample was made up of 822 primary school pupils from 10 public schools. Data were collected through self-reports, exploring the profile of victims of school bullying, and the dimensions of self-perceived emotional intelligence (PEI). A multivariate analysis and multinomial regression showed a relationship between the two variables; the probability of being a victim of school bullying was 5.14 times higher among pupils with low clarity, 2.72 times higher among pupils with low repair, and 2.62 times higher among pupils with excessive attention. The results demonstrated that the better their emotional regulation and understanding, the less likely pupils are to be victims of school bullying. This confirmed that adequate emotional attention and excellent emotional clarity and repair are protective factors against victimization.", "AI is becoming ubiquitous, revolutionizing many aspects of our lives. In surgery, it is still a promise. AI has the potential to improve surgeon performance and impact patient care, from post-operative debrief to real-time decision support. But, how much data is needed by an AI-based system to learn surgical context with high fidelity? To answer this question, we leveraged a large-scale, diverse, cholecystectomy video dataset. We assessed surgical workflow recognition and report a deep learning system, that not only detects surgical phases, but does so with high accuracy and is able to generalize to new settings and unseen medical centers. Our findings provide a solid foundation for translating AI applications from research to practice, ushering in a new era of surgical intelligence.", "Since the outbreak of COVID-19, it has spread rapidly throughout the country and even in the world.

The World Health Organization has recommended that member states develop self-harm surveillance systems as part of their suicide prevention efforts. This is also a priority under Australia's Fifth National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan. The aim of this paper is to describe the development of a state-based self-harm monitoring system in Victoria, Australia. In this system, data on all self-harm presentations are collected from eight hospital emergency departments in Victoria. A natural language processing classifier that uses machine learning to identify episodes of self-harm is currently being developed. This uses the free-text triage case notes, together with certain structured data fields, contained within the metadata of the incoming records. Post-processing is undertaken to identify primary mechanism of injury, substances consumed (including alcohol, illicit drugs and pharmaceutical preparations) and presence of psychiatric disorders. This system will ultimately leverage routinely collected data in combination with advanced artificial intelligence methods to support robust community-wide monitoring of self-harm. Once fully operational, this system will provide accurate and timely information on all presentations to participating emergency departments for self-harm, thereby providing a useful indicator for Australia's suicide prevention efforts.", "Since the epidemic outbreak in early months of 2020 the spread of COVID-19 has grown rapidly in most countries and regions across the World. Because of that, SARS-CoV-2 was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020, by The World Health Organization (WHO). That's why many scientists are working on new methods to reduce further growth of new cases and, by intelligent patients allocation, reduce number of patients per doctor, what can lead to more successful treatments. However to properly manage the COVID-19 spread there is a need for real-time prediction models which can reliably support various decisions both at national and international level. The problem in developing such system is the lack of general knowledge how the virus spreads and what would be the number of cases each day. Therefore prediction model must be able to conclude the situation from past data in the way that results will show a future trend and will possibly closely relate to the real numbers. In our opinion Artificial Intelligence gives a possibility to do it. In this article we present a model which can work as a part of an online system as a real-time predictor to help in estimation of COVID-19 spread. This prediction model is developed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to estimate the future situation by the use of geo-location and numerical data from past 2 weeks. The results of our model are confirmed by comparing them with real data and, during our research the model was correctly predicting the trend and very closely matching the numbers of new cases in each day.", "It has been reported repeatedly that depression in middle-aged people may cause serious ramifications in public health. However, previous studies on this important research topic have focused on utilizing either traditional statistical methods (i.e., logistic regressions) or black-or-gray artificial intelligence (AI) methods (i.e., neural network, Support Vector Machine (SVM), ensemble). Previous studies lack suggesting more decision-maker-friendly methods, which need to produce clear interpretable results with information on cause and effect. For the sake of improving the quality of decisions of healthcare decision-makers, public health issues require identification of cause and effect information for any type of strategic healthcare initiative. In this sense, this paper proposes a novel approach to identify the main causes of depression in middle-aged people in Korea. The proposed method is the Sons and Spouses Bayesian network model, which is an extended version of conventional TAN (Tree-Augmented Naive Bayesian Network). The target dataset is a longitudinal dataset employed from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) database with a sample size of 8580. After developing the proposed Sons and Spouses Bayesian network model, we found thirteen main causes leading to depression. Then, genetic optimization was executed to reveal the most probable cause of depression in middle-aged people that would provide practical implications to field practitioners. Therefore, our proposed method can help healthcare decision-makers comprehend changes in depression status by employing what-if queries towards a target individual.", "Positron emission tomography (PET) plays an increasingly important role in research and clinical applications, catalysed by remarkable technical advances and a growing appreciation of the need for reliable, sensitive biomarkers of human function in health and disease. Over the last 30 years, a large amount of the physics and engineering effort in PET has been motivated by the dominant clinical application during that period, oncology. This has led to important developments such as PET/CT, whole-body PET, 3D PET, accelerated statistical image reconstruction, and time-of-flight PET. Despite impressive improvements in image quality as a result of these advances, the emphasis on static, semi-quantitative 'hot spot' imaging for oncologic applications has meant that the capability of PET to quantify biologically relevant parameters based on tracer kinetics has not been fully exploited. More recent advances, such as PET/MR and total-body PET, have opened up the ability to address a vast range of new research questions, from which a future expansion of applications and radiotracers appears highly likely. Many of these new applications and tracers will, at least initially, require quantitative analyses that more fully exploit the exquisite sensitivity of PET and the tracer principle on which it is based. It is also expected that they will require more sophisticated quantitative analysis methods than those that are currently available. At the same time, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing data analysis and impacting the relationship between the statistical quality of the acquired data and the information we can extract from the data. In this roadmap, leaders of the key sub-disciplines of the field identify the challenges and opportunities to be addressed over the next ten years that will enable PET to realise its full quantitative potential, initially in research laboratories and, ultimately, in clinical practice.", "Few studies have assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes in normocephalic infants born to women with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy in Mexico. We sought to evaluate ZIKV exposed infants in Yucatan, Mexico, with performance-based and eye-gaze measures of neurodevelopment, removing observer bias.\nWe enrolled 60 infants about 6-month old born to women with PCR + test for ZIKV during pregnancy. Infants were normocephalic and asymptomatic. Sixty infants born to women without a history of ZIKV infection were included as comparison. Children were assessed with the Mullen scales of early learning (MSEL), a test with scales in motor, language, and overall cognitive skills development, and the Fagan test of infant intelligence (FTII) using automated eye-tracking instrumentation to evaluate infant visual preference of human faces, where longer gaze lengths to unfamiliar (i.e., new) faces are expected.\nAll MSEL subscale scores, except expressive language, were significantly lower among ZIKV exposed children compared to controls, including the overall standard composite (80 \u00b1 10 vs. 87 \u00b1 7.4, respectively; p < 0.001). FTII eye-tracking measures of fixation and gaze length were in the expected direction, with longer times recorded among infants in the control group (i.e., higher attention), but none reached statistical significance. In adjusted linear regressions, the FTII high novelty score (expected preference for a novel face) predicted fine motor (\u03b2 = 3.61, p = 0.04) and receptive language (\u03b2 = 2.55, p = 0.03) scores.\nNonmicrocephalic children born to women with ZIKV during pregnancy in Mexico merit early neurodevelopmental evaluation to allow for appropriate interventions and clinical follow-up. It is possible that long-term monitoring of cognitive deficits may need to be established for a proportion of affected cases.", "Detailed pathology analysis and morphological quantification is tedious and prone to errors.

Here, we present the evaluation of the DeePathology STUDIO\u2122 for automatic analysis of histological whole-slide images using machine learning/artificial intelligence.\nTo evaluate and validate the use of DeePathology STUDIO for the analysis of histological slides at high resolution.\nWe compared the DeePathology STUDIO and our current standard method using macros in AxioVision for the analysis of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and microglia in APP-transgenic mice at different ages. We analyzed density variables and total time invested with each approach. In addition, we correlated A\u03b2 concentration in brain tissue measured by ELISA with the results of A\u03b2 staining analysis.\nDeePathology STUDIO showed a significant decrease of the time for establishing new analyses and the total analysis time by up to 90%. On the other hand, both approaches showed similar quantitative results in plaque and activated microglia density in the different experimental groups. DeePathology STUDIO showed higher sensitivity and accuracy for small-sized plaques. In addition, DeePathology STUDIO allowed the classification of plaques in diffuse- and dense-packed, which was not possible with our traditional analysis.\nDeePathology STUDIO substantially reduced the effort needed for a new analysis showing comparable quantitative results to the traditional approach. In addition, it allowed including different objects (categories) or cell types in a single analysis, which is not possible with conventional methods.", "The development of artificial skin, such as electronic skin, is critical to emerging artificial intelligence systems. Electronic skins reported to date are mechanically flexible, and can detect various stimuli, but lack the ability to regulate themselves and learn information from the outside world. The integration of bio-inspired multifunction in a single electronic platform is critical to the development of e-skin systems. Here, we demonstrate a self-powered, light-stimulated, smart e-skin based on a photosensitive perovskite material. The electronic skin implements the functions of both tactile sensing and photoelectric neural computing. The strategy for developing such a material system and architecture of the electronic skin meets the requirement of multifunctional smart human-machine interfaces and has promising potential for application in future artificial intelligence systems.", "Semantic memory (SM) is a type of long-term memory associated with the storage of general information about the world. Here we assessed the characteristics of the SM battery, developed by Catrical\u00e0 et al. (2013), in a sample of Colombian children. This battery was originally conceived to evaluate adults, and features six subtests that assess SM in di\ufb00erent modalities, using a common set of 48 stimuli in both living and nonliving categories. The design of the current study is of a cross-sectional and exploratory type. The sample was composed of 111 children, 57 boys (51%) and 54 girls (49%), who were 6 (n = 68) and 7 (n = 43) years old and had no intellectual disability. Robust linear regression models and correlation networks were used. We found an e\ufb00ect of age on general intelligence after correcting for gender, and no di\ufb00erences on the six subtest scores after corrections for gender and age were performed. Furthermore, age was found to be positively associated with the naming of colored photographs (\u03b2 = .75, p = .039), naming in response to an oral description (\u03b2 = 1.81, p = .039), picture sorting at four levels (\u03b2 = 7.22, p = .029), and sentence verification (\u03b2 = 26.66, p = .01). In addition, there were di\ufb00erences between the results obtained in adults in the original study and in the children of our study.

This model is mainly aimed at generating the running trajectory of a dancing robot and the execution plan of the dancing action. First, we used digital twin technology to establish data mapping between the robot and the computer simulation environment to realize intelligent controllability of the robot's trajectory and the dance movements described in this paper. Second, we conducted many experiments and carried out a lot of research into information retrieval, information fidelity, and result evaluation. We constructed a multilevel three-dimensional spatial quantum knowledge map (M-3DQKG) based on the coherence and entangled states of quantum modeling and simulation. Combined with dance videos, we used regions with convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) to extract character bones and movement features to form a movement library. We used M-3DQKG to quickly retrieve information from the knowledge base, action library, and database, and then the system generated action models through a holistically nested edge detection (HED) network. The system then rendered scenes that matched the actions through generative adversarial networks (GANs). Finally, the scene and dance movements were integrated, and the creative generation process was completed. This paper also proposes the creativity generation coefficient as a means of evaluating the results of the creative process, combined with artificial brain electroenchalographic data to assist in evaluating the degree of agreement between creativity and needs. This paper aims to realize the automation and intelligence of the creative generation process and improve the creative generation effect and usability of dance movements. Experiments show that this paper has significantly improved the efficiency of knowledge retrieval and the accuracy of knowledge acquisition, and can generate unique and practical dance moves. The robot's trajectory is novel and changeable, and can meet the needs of dance performances in different scenes. The creative generation process of dancing robots combined with deep learning and quantum technology is a required field for future development, and could provide a considerable boost to the progress of human society.", "Artificial intelligence appears as a potential revolution in the general process of medical training, disease diagnosis and treatment. A novel disruptive technology of the 21st century will be 'learner' robots from artificial intelligence systems able to use all the combination of the available knowledge in medical repositories to give the best standard of care.\nThe autonomy level of robots depends on three factors: the complexity of the task; the environment in which the robot operates, and the required level of human-robot interaction. Autonomous robots in healthcare may be classified in delivery, nurse, and surgical robots. The increasing capability of robots to perform independent actions and complex tasks raises responsibility and accountability issues in a wide variety of application domains. Ethical analyses of these issues are underway and are mostly oriented toward the development of ethical policies requiring a law frame on robotic autonomous behaviors.\nAutonomous robots have the potential to improve current medical practice offering a more secure, reliable, and reproducible medicine. Many advancements are required for these new technologies to be fully integrated. Furthermore, the ethical implications of these technologies are yet to be evaluated.", "Burnout is being experienced by medical students, residents, and practicing physicians at significant rates. Higher levels of Hardiness and Emotional Intelligence may protect individuals against burnout symptoms. Previous studies have shown both Hardiness and Emotional IntelIigence protect against detrimental effects of stress and can be adapted through training; however, there is limited research on how training programs affect both simultaneously. Therefore, the objective of this study was to define the association of Hardiness and Emotional Intelligence and their potential improvement through hyper realistic immersion simulation training in military medical students.\nParticipants in this study consisted of 68 second year medical students representing five medical schools who were concurrently enrolled in the United States military scholarship program. During a six day hyper-realistic surgical simulation training course, students rotated through different roles of a medical team and responded to several mass-casualty scenarios. Hardiness and Emotional Intelligence were assessed using the Hardiness Resilience Gauge (HRG) and the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-I 2.0) respectively, at two time points: on arrival (pre-event) and after completion of the course (post-event).\nHardiness and Emotional Intelligence scores and sub scores consistently improved from pre-event to post-event assessments. No difference in training benefit was observed between genders but differences were observed by age where age was more often associated with Emotional Intelligence. In addition, factor analysis indicated that the HRG and EQ-I 2.0 assessment tools measured predominately different traits although they share some commonalities in some components.\nThis study indicates that Hardiness and Emotional Intelligence scores can be improved through immersion training in military medical students. Results from this study support the use of training course interventions and prompt the need for long term evaluation of improvement strategies on mitigating burnout symptoms.", "Technological developments in ophthalmic imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) create new possibilities for diagnostics in eye care. AI has already been applied in ophthalmic diabetes care. AI-systems currently detect diabetic retinopathy in general practice with a high sensitivity and specificity. AI-systems for the screening, monitoring and treatment of age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma are promising and are still being developed. AI-algorithms, however, only perform tasks for which they have been specifically trained and highly depend on the data and reference-standard that were used to train the system in identifying a certain abnormality or disease. How the data and the gold standard were established and determined, influences the performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, interpretability of deep learning algorithms is still an ongoing issue. By highlighting on images the areas that were critical for the decision of the algorithm, users can gain more insight into how algorithms come to a particular result.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a disruptive technology that involves the use of computerised algorithms to dissect complicated data. Among the most promising clinical applications of AI is diagnostic imaging, and mounting attention is being directed at establishing and fine-tuning its performance to facilitate detection and quantification of a wide array of clinical conditions. Investigations leveraging computer-aided diagnostics have shown excellent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the detection of small radiographic abnormalities, with the potential to improve public health. However, outcome assessment in AI imaging studies is commonly defined by lesion detection while ignoring the type and biological aggressiveness of a lesion, which might create a skewed representation of AI's performance. Moreover, the use of non-patient-focused radiographic and pathological endpoints might enhance the estimated sensitivity at the expense of increasing false positives and possible overdiagnosis as a result of identifying minor changes that might reflect subclinical or indolent disease. We argue for refinement of AI imaging studies via consistent selection of clinically meaningful endpoints such as survival, symptoms, and need for treatment.", "Mammography is the current standard for breast cancer screening. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography, and explore whether it could benefit radiologists by improving accuracy of diagnosis.\nIn this retrospective study, an AI algorithm was developed and validated with 170\u2008230 mammography examinations collected from five institutions in South Korea, the USA, and the UK, including 36\u2008468 cancer positive confirmed by biopsy, 59\u2008544 benign confirmed by biopsy (8827 mammograms) or follow-up imaging (50\u2008717 mammograms), and 74\u2008218 normal. For the multicentre, observer-blinded, reader study, 320 mammograms (160 cancer positive, 64 benign, 96 normal) were independently obtained from two institutions. 14 radiologists participated as readers and assessed each mammogram in terms of likelihood of malignancy (LOM), location of malignancy, and necessity to recall the patient, first without and then with assistance of the AI algorithm. The performance of AI and radiologists was evaluated in terms of LOM-based area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and recall-based sensitivity and specificity.\nThe AI standalone performance was AUROC 0\u00b7959 (95% CI 0\u00b7952-0\u00b7966) overall, and 0\u00b7970 (0\u00b7963-0\u00b7978) in the South Korea dataset, 0\u00b7953 (0\u00b7938-0\u00b7968) in the USA dataset, and 0\u00b7938 (0\u00b7918-0\u00b7958) in the UK dataset. In the reader study, the performance level of AI was 0\u00b7940 (0\u00b7915-0\u00b7965), significantly higher than that of the radiologists without AI assistance (0\u00b7810, 95% CI 0\u00b7770-0\u00b7850; p<0\u00b70001). With the assistance of AI, radiologists' performance was improved to 0\u00b7881 (0\u00b7850-0\u00b7911; p<0\u00b70001). AI was more sensitive to detect cancers with mass (53 [90%] vs 46 [78%] of 59 cancers detected; p=0\u00b7044) or distortion or asymmetry (18 [90%] vs ten [50%] of 20 cancers detected; p=0\u00b7023) than radiologists. AI was better in detection of T1 cancers (73 [91%] vs 59 [74%] of 80; p=0\u00b70039) or node-negative cancers (104 [87%] vs 88 [74%] of 119; p=0\u00b70025) than radiologists.\nThe AI algorithm developed with large-scale mammography data showed better diagnostic performance in breast cancer detection compared with radiologists. The significant improvement in radiologists' performance when aided by AI supports application of AI to mammograms as a diagnostic support tool.\nLunit.", "To investigate the value of artificial intelligence (AI) assisted quantification on initial chest CT for prediction of disease progression and clinical outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and initially of non-severe type were retrospectively included. The initial CT scan on admission was used for imaging analysis. The presence of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and other findings were visually evaluated. CT severity score was calculated according to the extent of lesion involvement. In addition, AI based quantification of GGO and consolidation volume were also performed. 123 patients (mean age: 64.43\u2009\u00b1\u200914.02; 62 males) were included. GGO\u2009+\u2009consolidation was more frequently revealed in progress-to-severe group whereas pure GGO was more likely to be found in non-severe group. Compared to non-severe group, patients in progress-to-severe group had larger GGO volume (167.33\u2009\u00b1\u2009167.88\u00a0cm3 versus 101.12\u2009\u00b1\u2009127\u00a0cm3, p\u2009=\u20090.013) as well as consolidation volume (40.85\u2009\u00b1\u200960.4\u00a0cm3 versus 6.63\u2009\u00b1\u200914.91\u00a0cm3, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Among imaging parameters, consolidation volume had the largest area under curve (AUC) in discriminating non-severe from progress-to-severe group (AUC\u2009=\u20090.796, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and patients with or without critical events (AUC\u2009=\u20090.754, p\u2009<\u20090.001). According to multivariate regression, consolidation volume and age were two strongest predictors for disease progression (hazard ratio: 1.053 and 1.071, p: 0.006 and 0.008) whereas age and diabetes were predictors for unfavorable outcome. Consolidation volume quantified on initial chest CT was the strongest predictor for disease severity progression and larger consolidation volume was associated with unfavorable clinical outcome.", "From cell phones to aerospace, artificial intelligence (AI) has wide-reaching influence in the modern age. In this review, we discuss the application of AI solutions to an equally ubiquitous problem in cytopathology - thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Thyroid nodules are common in the general population, and FNAB is the sampling modality of choice. The resulting prevalence in the practicing pathologist's daily workload makes thyroid FNAB an appealing target for the application of AI solutions.\nThis review summarizes all available literature on the application of AI to thyroid cytopathology. We follow the evolution from morphometric analysis to convolutional neural networks. We explore the application of AI technology to different questions in thyroid cytopathology, including distinguishing papillary carcinoma from benign, distinguishing follicular adenoma from carcinoma and identifying non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features by key words and phrases. Key Messages: The current literature shows promise towards the application of AI technology to thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy. Much work is needed to define how this powerful technology will be of best use to the future of cytopathology practice.", "Importance: Assessing facial function using high-quality photographs would improve long-term and objective outcomes tracking in facial palsy, facilitate automated facial grading using artificial intelligence algorithms, and allow for remote follow up. Objective: To determine agreement between in-person and photographic electronic facial function scale (eFACE) assessments, and evaluate inter-rater reliability of photographic eFACE evaluation. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective review of eFACE scores from in-person interviews and standardized photographs using the Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE) Standard Facial Palsy Dataset. Main Outcomes and Measures: eFACE total scores and subset scores determined by two experienced facial reanimation surgeons in person and from photographs. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients for eFACE scores were 0.96 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.97) for total scores, 0.99 (95% CI 0.989 to 0.995) for static scores, 0.82 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.88) for dynamic scores, and 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 0.99) for synkinesis scores. Photographic and in-person scores had a mean difference of -0.64 (95% CI -2.05 to 0.77; p\u2009=\u20090.37) for total score, -1.58 (95% CI -4.22 to 1.05; p\u2009=\u20090.24) for the static subset, 0.14 (95% CI -1.70 to 1.97; p\u2009=\u20090.88) for the dynamic subset, and -1.11 (95% CI -3.09 to 0.86; p\u2009=\u20090.26) for the synkinetic subset. Bland-Altman analysis showed no trend for increasing differences in total score or subset scores. Conclusions: eFACE assessment obtained via photographs exhibits excellent inter-rater reliability and strong agreement with in-person assessment, demonstrating facial symmetry in facial palsy patients can be monitored using standardized frontal photographs.", "The importance of a data management strategy is increasingly necessary for demonstrating value and driving performance within pharmacy departments. Data analytics capabilities often do not match the pace of data accumulation. At our organization, the establishment of an embedded pharmacy analytics and outcomes (PAO) team has been instrumental to pharmacy services in generating and demonstrating value and proactively supporting a business intelligence strategy grounded in a data-driven culture.\nThe PAO team was established to support the operational and strategic needs of clinical, financial, and operational pharmacy services. The team is charged with implementing the vision of extending medication-use influence and data insight to drive value-based patient care outcomes while decreasing waste, optimizing therapeutic decisions, and achieving medication management standardization across the continuum of healthcare. The PAO team is composed of 3 pharmacist full-time equivalents (FTEs), 5 business analyst FTEs, 1 biostatistician FTE, 0.2 pharmacy intern FTE, and 1 pharmacy manager FTE. Pharmacy services leaders believe it is necessary to have a mix of both clinical and analytical skill sets, given the clinical nature of the data managed by team and complexities of the medication-use process.\nPharmacy reporting and analytics should require the same depth of scrutiny and overview as any other step in the medication-use process where pharmacists are held accountable. For our organization, it was critical to establish pharmacist-level oversight into every portion of the analytics process where medication data are involved. This structure has led to measurable improvements in patient outcomes, operational efficiency, and financial performance.", "The problem of the automatic determination of the first and second ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2) from cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) still leads to controversy. The reliability of the gold standard methodology (i.e. expert visual inspection) feeds into the debate and several authors call for more objective automatic methods to be used in the clinical practice. In this study, we present a framework based on a collaborative approach, where a web-application was used to crowd-source a large number (1245) of CPET data of individuals with different aerobic fitness. The resulting database was used to train and test an artificial intelligence (i.e. a convolutional neural network) algorithm. This automatic classifier is currently implemented in another web-application and was used to detect the ventilatory thresholds in the available CPET. A total of 206 CPET were used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimations against the expert opinions. The neural network was able to detect the ventilatory thresholds with an average mean absolute error of 178 (198) mlO2/min (11.1%, r\u2009=\u20090.97) and 144 (149) mlO2/min (6.1%, r\u2009=\u20090.99), for VT1 and VT2 respectively. The performance of the neural network in detecting VT1 deteriorated in case of individuals with poor aerobic fitness. Our results suggest the potential for a collective intelligence system to outperform isolated experts in ventilatory thresholds detection. However, the inclusion of a larger number of VT1 examples certified by a community of experts will be likely needed before the abilities of this collective intelligence can be translated into the clinical use of CPET.", "Dysphagia management, from screening procedures to diagnostic methods and therapeutic approaches, is about to change dramatically. This change is prompted not solely by great discoveries in medicine or physiology, but by advances in electronics and data science and close collaboration and cross-pollination between these two disciplines. In this editorial, we will provide a brief overview of the role of artificial intelligence in dysphagia management.", "The SPIRIT 2013 statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret, and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial.", "Screening for chronic kidney disease is a challenge in community and primary care settings, even in high-income countries. We developed an artificial intelligence deep learning algorithm (DLA) to detect chronic kidney disease from retinal images, which could add to existing chronic kidney disease screening strategies.\nWe used data from three population-based, multiethnic, cross-sectional studies in Singapore and China. The Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study (SEED, patients aged \u226540 years) was used to develop (5188 patients) and validate (1297 patients) the DLA. External testing was done on two independent datasets: the Singapore Prospective Study Program (SP2, 3735 patients aged \u226525 years) and the Beijing Eye Study (BES, 1538 patients aged \u226540 years). Chronic kidney disease was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min per 1\u00b773m2. Three models were trained: 1) image DLA; 2) risk factors (RF) including age, sex, ethnicity, diabetes, and hypertension; and 3) hybrid DLA combining image and RF. Model performances were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\nIn the SEED validation dataset, the AUC was 0\u00b7911 for image DLA (95% CI 0\u00b7886 -0\u00b7936), 0\u00b7916 for RF (0\u00b7891-0\u00b7941), and 0\u00b7938 for hybrid DLA (0\u00b7917-0\u00b7959).

Ensemble docking makes use of MD results by docking compound databases into representative protein binding-site conformations, thus taking into account the dynamic properties of the binding sites. We also describe preliminary results obtained for 24 systems involving eight proteins of the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. The MD involves temperature replica exchange enhanced sampling, making use of massively parallel supercomputing to quickly sample the configurational space of protein drug targets. Using the Summit supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, more than 1 ms of enhanced sampling MD can be generated per day. We have ensemble docked repurposing databases to 10 configurations of each of the 24 SARS-CoV-2 systems using AutoDock Vina. Comparison to experiment demonstrates remarkably high hit rates for the top scoring tranches of compounds identified by our ensemble approach. We also demonstrate that, using Autodock-GPU on Summit, it is possible to perform exhaustive docking of one billion compounds in under 24 h. Finally, we discuss preliminary results and planned improvements to the pipeline, including the use of quantum mechanical (QM), machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to cluster MD trajectories and rescore docking poses.", "The article presents a systematic review protocol. The aim of the study is an assessment of current studies regarding the application of artificial intelligence and neural networks in the screening for adverse perinatal outcomes. We intend to compare the reported efficacy of these methods to improve pregnancy care and outcomes. There are more and more studies that describe the role of machine learning in facilitating the diagnosis of adverse perinatal outcomes, like gestational diabetes or pregnancy hypertension. A systematic review of available literature seems to be crucial to compare the known efficacy and application. Publication of a systematic review in this category would improve the value of future studies. The studies reporting on artificial intelligence application will have a major impact on future prenatal practice.", "Artificial visual systems with image sensing and storage functions have considerable potential in the field of artificial intelligence. Light-stimulated synaptic devices can be applied for neuromorphic computing to build artificial visual systems. Here, optoelectronic synaptic transistors based on 5,15-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-10,20-(4-nitrophenyl)porphyrin (TPP) and dinaphtho[2,3-b:2',3'-f\u2009]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (DNTT) are demonstrated. By utilizing stable TPP with high light absorption, the number of photogenerated carriers in the transport layer can be increased significantly. The devices exhibit high photosensitivity and tunable synaptic plasticity. The synaptic weight can be effectively modulated by the intensity, width, and wavelength of the light signals. Due to the high light absorption of TPP, an ultrasensitive artificial visual array based on these devices is developed, which can detect weak light signals as low as 1 \u00b5W cm-2 . Low-voltage operation is further demonstrated. Even with applied voltages as low as -70 \u00b5V, the devices can still show obvious responses, leading to an ultralow energy consumption of 1.4 fJ. The devices successfully demonstrate image sensing and storage functions, which can accurately identify visual information. In addition, the devices can preprocess information and achieve noise reduction. The excellent synaptic behavior of the TPP-based electronics suggests their good potential in the development of new intelligent visual systems.", "The studies about the effect of the graphene reinforcement ratio and machining parameters to improve the machining performance of Ti6Al4V alloy are still rare and incomplete to meet the Industry 4.0 manufacturing criteria. In this study, a hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with a multi-objective particle swarm optimization method is developed to obtain the optimal combination of milling parameters and reinforcement ratio that lead to minimize the feed force, depth force, and surface roughness. For achieving this, Ti6Al4V matrix nanocomposites reinforced with 0 wt.%, 0.6 wt.%, and 1.2 wt.% graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are produced. Afterward, a full factorial approach was used to design experiments to investigate the effect of cutting speed, feed rate, and graphene nanoplatelets ratio on machining behaviour. After that, artificial intelligence based on ANFIS is used to develop prediction models as the fitness function of the multi-objective particle swarm optimization method. The experimental results showed that the developed models can obtain an accurate estimation of depth force, feed force, and surface roughness with a mean absolute percentage error of 3.87%, 8.56%, and 2.21%, respectively, as compared with experimentally measured outputs. In addition, the developed artificial intelligence models showed 361.24%, 35.05%, and 276.47% less errors for depth force, feed force, and surface roughness, respectively, as compared with the traditional mathematical models. The multi-objective optimization results from the new approach indicated that a cutting speed of 62 m/min, feed rate of 139 mm/min, and GNPs reinforcement ratio of 1.145 wt.% lead to the improved machining characteristics of GNPs reinforced Ti6Al4V matrix nanocomposites. Henceforth, the hybrid method as a novel artificial intelligent method can be used for optimizing the machining processes with complex relationships between the output responses.", "This paper aims to propose a methodology for measuring user experience (UX) by using artificial intelligence-aided design (AIAD) technology in mobile application design. Unlike the traditional assistance design tools, AIAD focuses on the rational use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to measure and improve UX since conventional data collection methods (such as user interview and user observation) for user behavior data are inefficient and time-consuming. We propose to obtain user behavior data from logs of mobile application. In order to protect the privacy of users, only a few dimensions of information is used in the process of browsing and operating mobile application. The goal of the proposed methodology is to make the deep neural network model simulate the user's experience in the process of operating a mobile application as much as possible. We design and use projected pages of application to train neural networks for specific tasks. These projected pages consist of the click information of all users in the process of completing a certain task. Thus, features of user behavior can be aggregated and mapped in the connection layers and the hidden layers. Finally, the optimized design is executed on the social communication application to verify the efficiency of the proposed methodology.", "Galician newborn screening program for early detection of endocrine and metabolic diseases began in 1978 and was a pioneer in expanded newborn screening in Spain with the incorporation of mass spectrometry in July 2000. As a primary objective, 28 diseases are screened, including those recommended SNS except sickle cell anemia which is in the inclusion phase.

In order to make such predictions, strain sensors are mounted to the structure, from which data are acquired during operational time. This allows to determine how many load cycles has the structure withstood so far. Continuous monitoring of the strain distribution of the whole structure can be complicated due to vicissitude nature of the loads. Sensors should be mounted in places where stress and strain accumulations occur, and due to experiencing variable loads, the number of required sensors may be high. In this work, different machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms are implemented to predict the current safety factor of the structure in its most stressed point, based on relatively low number of strain measurements. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), support-vector machines (SVM) and Gaussian processes for machine learning (GPML) are trained with simulation data, and their effectiveness is measured using data obtained from experiments. The proposed methods are compared to the earlier work where artificial neural networks (ANN) were proven to be efficiently used for reduction of the number of sensors in operational load monitoring processes. A numerical comparison of accuracy and computational time (taking into account possible real-time applications) between all considered methods is provided.", "SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, has caused havoc worldwide, with patients presenting a spectrum of complications that have pushed health care experts to explore new technological solutions and treatment plans. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technologies have played a substantial role in solving complex problems, and several organizations have been swift to adopt and customize these technologies in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the role of AI as a comprehensive and decisive technology to fight the COVID-19 crisis in the fields of epidemiology, diagnosis, and disease progression.\nA systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases was performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines to identify all potentially relevant studies published and made available online between December 1, 2019, and June 27, 2020. The search syntax was built using keywords specific to COVID-19 and AI.\nThe search strategy resulted in 419 articles published and made available online during the aforementioned period. Of these, 130 publications were selected for further analyses. These publications were classified into 3 themes based on AI applications employed to combat the COVID-19 crisis: Computational Epidemiology, Early Detection and Diagnosis, and Disease Progression. Of the 130 studies, 71 (54.6%) focused on predicting the COVID-19 outbreak, the impact of containment policies, and potential drug discoveries, which were classified under the Computational Epidemiology theme. Next, 40 of 130 (30.8%) studies that applied AI techniques to detect COVID-19 by using patients' radiological images or laboratory test results were classified under the Early Detection and Diagnosis theme. Finally, 19 of the 130 studies (14.6%) that focused on predicting disease progression, outcomes (ie, recovery and mortality), length of hospital stay, and number of days spent in the intensive care unit for patients with COVID-19 were classified under the Disease Progression theme.\nIn this systematic review, we assembled studies in the current COVID-19 literature that utilized AI-based methods to provide insights into different COVID-19 themes. Our findings highlight important variables, data types, and available COVID-19 resources that can assist in facilitating clinical and translational research.", "Hyperspectral imaging provides spatially resolved spectral information. Utilizing dual-frequency combs as active illumination sources, hyperspectral imaging with ultra-high spectral resolution can be implemented in a scan-free manner when a detector array is used for heterodyne detection. Here, we show that dual-comb hyperspectral imaging can be performed with an uncooled near-to-mid-infrared detector by exploiting the detector array's high frame rate, achieving 10 Hz acquisition in 30 spectral channels across 16,384 pixels. Artificial intelligence (AI) enables real-time data reduction and imaging of gas concentration based on characteristic molecular absorption signatures. Owing to the detector array's sensitivity from 1 to 5 \u00b5m wavelength, this demonstration lays the foundation for real-time versatile imaging of molecular fingerprint signatures across the infrared wavelength regime with high temporal resolution.", "This investigation is conducted to study the integration of the artificial intelligence (AI) method with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The case study is hydrodynamic and heat-transfer analyses of water flow in a metal foam tube under a constant wall heat flux (i.e., 55 kW/m2). The adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is an AI method. A 3D CFD model is established in ANSYS-FLUENT software. The velocity of the fluid in the x-direction (Ux) is considered as an output of the ANFIS. The x, y, and z coordinates of the node's location are added to the ANFIS step-by-step to achieve the best intelligence. The number and type of membership functions (MFs) are changed in each step. The training process is done by the CFD results on the tube cross-sections at different lengths (i.e., z = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9), while all data (including z = 0.5) are selected for the testing process. The results showed that the ANFIS reaches the best intelligence with all three inputs, five MFs, and \"gbellmf\"-type MF. At this condition, the regression number is close to 1.", "Adversarial attack techniques in deep learning have been studied extensively due to its stealthiness to human eyes and potentially dangerous consequences when applied to real-life applications. However, current attack methods in black-box settings mainly employ a large number of queries for crafting their adversarial examples, hence making them very likely to be detected and responded by the target system (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI) service provider) due to its high traffic volume. A recent proposal able to address the large query problem utilizes a gradient-free approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Unfortunately, this original approach tends to have a low attack success rate, possibly due to the model's difficulty of escaping local optima. This obstacle can be overcome by employing a multi-group approach for PSO algorithm, by which the PSO particles can be redistributed, preventing them from being trapped in local optima. In this paper, we present a black-box adversarial attack which can significantly increase the success rate of PSO-based attack while maintaining a low number of query by launching the attack in a distributed manner. Attacks are executed from multiple nodes, disseminating queries among the nodes, hence reducing the possibility of being recognized by the target system while also increasing scalability. Furthermore, we utilize Multi-Group PSO with Random Redistribution (MGRR-PSO) for perturbation generation, performing better than the original approach against local optima, thus achieving a higher success rate. Additionally, we propose to efficiently remove excessive perturbation (i.e, perturbation pruning) by utilizing again the MGRR-PSO rather than a standard iterative method as used in the original approach. We perform five different experiments: comparing our attack's performance with existing algorithms, testing in high-dimensional space in ImageNet dataset, examining our hyperparameters (i.e., particle size, number of clients, search boundary), and testing on real digital attack to Google Cloud Vision. Our attack proves to obtain a 100% success rate on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and able to successfully fool Google Cloud Vision as a proof of the real digital attack by maintaining a lower query and wide applicability.", "Anaemia is an important health-care burden globally, and screening for anaemia is crucial to prevent multi-organ injury, irreversible complications, and life-threatening adverse events. We aimed to establish whether a deep learning algorithm (DLA) that enables non-invasive anaemia screening from electrocardiograms (ECGs) might improve the detection of anaemia.\nWe did a retrospective, multicentre, diagnostic study in which a DLA was developed using ECGs and then internally and externally validated. We used data from two hospitals, Sejong General Hospital (hospital A) and Mediplex Sejong Hospital (hospital B), in South Korea. Data from hospital A was for DLA development and internal validation, and data from hospital B was for external validation. We included individuals who had at least one ECG with a haemoglobin measurement within 1 h of the index ECG and excluded individuals with missing demographic, electrocardiographic, or haemoglobin information. Three types of DLA were developed with 12-lead, 6-lead (limb lead), and single-lead (lead I) ECGs to detect haemoglobin concentrations of 10 g/dL or less. The DLA was built by a convolutional neural network and used 500-Hz raw ECG, age, and sex as input data.\nThe study period ran from Oct 1, 2016, to Sept 30, 2019, in hospital A and March 1, 2017, to Sept 30, 2019, in hospital B. 40\u2008513 patients at hospital A and 4737 patients at hospital B were eligible for inclusion. We excluded 281 patients at hospital A and 72 patients at hospital B because of missing values for clinical information and ECG data. The development dataset comprised 57\u2008435 ECGs from 31\u2008898 patients, and the algorithm was internally validated with 7974 ECGs from 7974 patients. The external validation dataset included 4665 ECGs from 4665 patients. 586 (internal) and 194 (external) patients within the combined dataset were found to be anaemic. During internal and external validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of the DLA using a 12-lead ECG for detecting anaemia was 0\u00b7923 for internal validation and 0\u00b7901 for external validation. Using a 90% sensitivity operating point for the development data, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of internal validation were 89\u00b78%, 81\u00b75%, 99\u00b74%, and 20\u00b70%, respectively, and those of external validation were 86\u00b71%, 76\u00b72%, 99\u00b72%, and 13\u00b75%, respectively. The DLA focused on the QRS complex for deciding the presence of anaemia in a sensitivity map. The AUROCs of DLAs using 6 leads and a single lead were in the range of 0\u00b7841-0\u00b7890.\nIn this study, using raw ECG data, a DLA accurately detected anaemia. The application of artificial intelligence to ECGs could enable screening for anaemia.\nNone.", "Previous research has highlighted the relationship between being cybervictimised and the presence of clinical symptoms, such as depression. To date, however, there has been no comparative analysis of the personal resources profiles of adolescent victims of cyberbullying with and without depressive symptoms. The current study analysed the relationship between positive personal resources and clinical symptoms in 251 adolescent victims of cyberbullying at several Spanish high schools. It examined how several positive personal resources varied in adolescent victims of cyberbullying who displayed symptoms of depression (n = 89) or did not (n = 162). Victims of cyberbullying who displayed depressive symptoms reported lower levels of personal resources (emotional intelligence, gratitude, optimism, and forgiveness) than those who did not. Logistic regression provided evidence that gratitude was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms in victims of cyberbullying, followed by emotional intelligence and optimism. These findings expand the existing literature on the role of personal resources in mental health and highlight the need for their development in youths to help them cope more effectively and function better after being cyberbullied.", "Introduction: People with psychosis show impairments in cognitive flexibility, a phenomenon that is still poorly understood. In this study, we tested if there were differences in cognitive and metacognitive processes related to rigidity in patients with psychosis. We compared individuals with dichotomous interpersonal thinking and those with flexible interpersonal thinking. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis using two groups with psychosis, one with low levels of dichotomous interpersonal thinking (n = 42) and the other with high levels of dichotomous interpersonal thinking (n = 43). The patients were classified by splitting interpersonal dichotomous thinking (measured using the repertory grid technique) to the median. The groups were administered a sociodemographic questionnaire, a semi-structured interview to assess psychotic symptoms [Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)], a self-report of cognitive insight [Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS)], neurocognitive tasks [Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)], and the repertory grid technique. We used a logistic regression model to test which factors best differentiate the two groups. Results: The group with high dichotomous interpersonal thinking had earlier age at onset of the psychotic disorder, higher self-certainty, impaired executive functioning, affected abstract thinking, and lower estimated cognitive reserve than the group with flexible thinking. According to the logistic regression model, estimated cognitive reserve and self-certainty were the variables that better differentiated between the two groups. Conclusion: Cognitive rigidity may be a generalized bias that affects not only neurocognitive and metacognitive processes but also the sense of self and significant others. Patients with more dichotomous interpersonal thinking might benefit from interventions that target this cognitive bias on an integrative way and that is adapted to their general level of cognitive abilities.", "Dentistry is a technically oriented profession, and the health care sector is significantly influenced by the ubiquitous trend of digitalization. Some of these digital developments have the potential to result in disruptive changes for dental practice, while others may turn out to be just a pipedream. This Discovery! essay focuses on innovations built on artificial intelligence (AI) as the center-technology influencing 1) dental eHealth data management, 2) clinical and technical health care applications, and 3) services and operations. AI systems enable personalized dental medicine workflows by analyzing all eHealth data gathered from an individual patient. Besides dental-specific data, this also includes genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic information and therefore facilitates optimized and personalized treatment strategies and risk management. Based on the power of AI, the triangular frame of \"data\"/\"health care\"/\"service\" is supplemented by technological advancements in the field of social media, Internet of things, augmented and virtual reality, rapid prototyping, and intraoral optical scanning as well as teledentistry. Innovation continues to be critical to tackle dental problems until its routine implementation based on sound scientific evidence. Novel technologies must be viewed critically in relation to the cost-benefit ratio and the ethical implications of a misleading diagnosis or treatment produced by AI algorithms. Highly sensitive eHealth data must be handled responsibly to enable the immense benefits of these technologies to be realized for society. The focus on patient-centered research and the development of personalized dental medicine have the potential to improve individual and public health, as well as clarify the interconnectivity of disease in a more cost-effective way.", "Knowledge of the mode of action of an allelochemical can be valuable for several reasons, such as proving and elucidating the role of the compound in nature and evaluating its potential utility as a pesticide. However, discovery of the molecular target site of a natural phytotoxin can be challenging. Because of this, we know little about the molecular targets of relatively few allelochemicals. It is much simpler to describe the secondary effects of these compounds, and, as a result, there is much information about these effects, which usually tell us little about the mode of action. This review describes the many approaches to molecular target site discovery, with an attempt to point out the pitfalls of each approach. Clues from molecular structure, phenotypic effects, physiological effects, omics studies, genetic approaches, and use of artificial intelligence are discussed. All these approaches can be confounded if the phytotoxin has more than one molecular target at similar concentrations or is a prophytotoxin, requiring structural alteration to create an active compound. Unequivocal determination of the molecular target site requires proof of activity on the function of the target protein and proof that a resistant form of the target protein confers resistance to the target organism.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications have transformed several industries and are widely used in various consumer products and services. In medicine, AI is primarily being used for image classification and natural language processing and has great potential to affect image-based specialties such as radiology, pathology, and gastroenterology (GE). This document reviews the reported applications of AI in GE, focusing on endoscopic image analysis.\nThe MEDLINE database was searched through May 2020 for relevant articles by using key words such as machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, computer-aided diagnosis, convolutional neural networks, GI endoscopy, and endoscopic image analysis. References and citations of the retrieved articles were also evaluated to identify pertinent studies. The manuscript was drafted by 2 authors and reviewed in person by members of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Technology Committee and subsequently by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Governing Board.\nDeep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks have been used in several areas of GI endoscopy, including colorectal polyp detection and classification, analysis of endoscopic images for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection, detection and depth assessment of early gastric cancer, dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, and detection of various abnormalities in wireless capsule endoscopy images.\nThe implementation of AI technologies across multiple GI endoscopic applications has the potential to transform clinical practice favorably and improve the efficiency and accuracy of current diagnostic methods.", "Since the middle of the nineteenth century, there has been increasing knowledge about the diagnosis and therapy of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system and muscle in children. The leading causes were cerebral palsy, epilepsy, inflammatory and degenerative diseases, and the innate reduction in intelligence. Because of the often lack of healing options, many pediatricians had little interest in treating these children and left their care to the pedagogues and psychologists. Pioneers of child neurology in the German-speaking countries were Ludwig Mauthner, Franz von Rinecker, Julius Zappert, and Georg Peritz. Especially with the beginning of the National Socialist terror regime, rigorous treatment methods were used, the care facilities for disabled children were closed, and these were either actively murdered or interned under inhumane conditions. In this time, some specialists in neuropediatrics had an ambivalent position between the care for their patients and the selection for their elimination. After 1950, new findings in diagnostics and therapy, especially from Anglo-American countries, played a significant role in the rise of neuropediatrics in Germany.", "The signature has long been in use for the user verification. These signatures have user specific features that differentiate the individual for authentication. The signature verification can be offline or online. The offline verification considers only the static features of the signatures through the signature image, while the online verification considers various dynamic features associated with the signature such as pen pressure, pen tilt angle, velocity, acceleration, pen up and pen down, etc at various time stamps which are recorded using special digitizing tablets such as Wacom devices (STU-500, STU-530 and DTU-1031) [1,14] etc. In todays scenario, smartphones are widely used world-wide, and come equipped with various sensors e.g. accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, etc. able to capture sensor logs and have been used widely in the literature to capture the dynamics of users' behaviour while a signer signs on his smartphone. However, there is scarcity of publicly available databases for the online signatures collected using smartphone. In the present work, we describe biometric signature dataset iSignDB captured using smartphone. The iSignDB [6,10] consists of the genuine signature samples of a user as well as the skilled forgery samples where imposter was given multiple attempts to mimic the mannerisms of the original signer before giving skilled forgery samples. A total of 30 samples towards the genuine signature over 3 sessions with 10 samples per session while 15 samples of the skilled forgery with 5 samples per session were collected. Each of the session were at least 15 days apart. The iOS and Android based smartphones (namely iPhone7 and Redmi Note 7) were used for the data collection. The sensors used to collect this data, present in the smartphone are the gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, and accelerometer. Smartphones having sensors any one lesser than these four, were not used for data collection, in order to have consistent number of features under each sample. They generate the following sensor readings: angular velocity, acceleration, orientation, geomagnetic field in the x, y, and z directions, position, which is collected using the MATLAB Mobile App installed in the smartphone, that sends the data to a licensed MathWorks cloud account in the form of a multitude of sensor logs. Each sample has image of the signature along with sensor readings. Some of the publicly available smartphone biometric signature databases are DooDB [2], MOBISIG [3], eBioSign DS 2 [7], etc. in which at least acceleration sensor reading is present but the iSignDB ensures these five of the sensor readings (acceleration, angular velocity, magnetic field, orientation, position) under each sample. This dataset can be successfully used to design smartphone biometric signature authentication system which is robust against a number of spoof attacks [11], [12], [13], [14]. As every user has a unique way of handling his/her smartphone which varies over different level of emotional intelligence of the user over a time period, this dataset can also be used for behavioural analysis of the users.", "SATB2 is a schizophrenia risk gene and is genetically associated with human intelligence. How it affects cognition at molecular level is currently unknown. Here, we show that interactions between SATB2, a chromosomal scaffolding protein, and the inner nuclear membrane protein LEMD2 orchestrate the response of pyramidal neurons to neuronal activation. Exposure to novel environment in vivo causes changes in nuclear shape of CA1 hippocampal neurons via a SATB2-dependent mechanism. The activity-driven plasticity of the nuclear envelope requires not only SATB2, but also its protein interactor LEMD2 and the ESCRT-III/VPS4 membrane-remodeling complex. Furthermore, LEMD2 depletion in cortical neurons, similar to SATB2 ablation, affects neuronal activity-dependent regulation of multiple rapid and delayed primary response genes. In human genetic data, LEMD2-regulated genes are enriched for de novo mutations reported in intellectual disability and schizophrenia and are, like SATB2-regulated genes, enriched for common variants associated with schizophrenia and cognitive function. Hence, interactions between SATB2 and the inner nuclear membrane protein LEMD2 influence gene expression programs in pyramidal neurons that are linked to cognitive ability and psychiatric disorder etiology.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making a continuous progression into the field of Radiation Oncology in Canada and globally. While this field continues to evolve, there is no clear understanding about how radiation oncologists, radiation therapists, medical physicists and radiation trainees perceive AI and its' impact on radiation oncology as a discipline. The purpose of this study was to investigate the perception of these four Canadian professional groups about AI. and how AI will affect radiation oncology as a specialty.\nFollowing an in-depth scientific review of the existing literature, a 29 Likert-scale questionnaire was developed using Google Survey. The questionnaire was piloted and distributed through national organizations including the Canadian Association for Radiation Oncology (CARO), the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Therapy (CAMRT) and the Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists (COMP), initially in February, and again between March and June 2020. The results were analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n159 responses were received from 10 Canadian provinces. Knowledge about AI was moderate with an average of 5/10, but 91% responded interest in learning more about it. The negative implications of AI were related to fear of losing jobs and shift of practice. The majority of participants agreed AI would positively impact on patient treatment.\nRadiation oncology professionals believe AI will be an important part of patient treatment in their future practices. The fear about AI may be mitigated with further education programs about AI, which can gain more confidence in the acceptance of AI.", "Optical data sensing, processing and visual memory are fundamental requirements for artificial intelligence and robotics with autonomous navigation. Traditionally, imaging has been kept separate from the pattern recognition circuitry. Optoelectronic synapses hold the special potential of integrating these two fields into a single layer, where a single device can record optical data, convert it into a conductance state and store it for learning and pattern recognition, similar to the optic nerve in human eye. In this work, the trapping and de-trapping of photogenerated carriers in the MoS2/SiO2 interface of a n-channel MoS2 transistor was employed to emulate the optoelectronic synapse characteristics. The monolayer MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) exhibits photo-induced short-term and long-term potentiation, electrically driven long-term depression, paired pulse facilitation (PPF), spike time dependent plasticity, which are necessary synaptic characteristics. Moreover, the device's ability to retain its conductance state can be modulated by the gate voltage, making the device behave as a photodetector for positive gate voltages and an optoelectronic synapse at negative gate voltages.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) and mindfulness can impact the level of anxiety and depression that an individual experiences. These symptoms have been exacerbated among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ajivar is an app that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to deliver personalized mindfulness and EI training.\nThe main objective of this research study was to determine the effectiveness of delivering an EI curriculum and mindfulness techniques using an AI conversation platform, Ajivar, to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression during this pandemic.\nA total of 99 subjects, aged 18 to 29 years, were recruited from a second-semester group of freshmen students. All participants completed the online TestWell Wellness Inventory at the start and end of the 14-week semester. The comparison group members (49/99, 49%) were given routine mental wellness instruction. The intervention group members (50/99, 51%) were required to complete Ajivar activities in addition to routine mental wellness instruction during the semester, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This group also completed assessments to evaluate for anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and depression, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).\nStudy participants reported a mean age of 19.9 (SD 1.94) years; 27% (27/99) of the group were male and 60% (59/99) identified as Caucasian. No significant demographic differences existed between the comparison and intervention groups. Subjects in the intervention group interacted with Ajivar for a mean time of 1424 (SD 1168) minutes. There was a significant decrease in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7: the mean score was 11.47 (SD 1.85) at the start of the study compared to 6.27 (SD 1.44) at the end (P<.001). There was a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression measured by the PHQ-9: the mean score was 10.69 (SD 2.04) at the start of the study compared to 6.69 (SD 2.41) at the end (P=.001). Both the intervention and comparison groups independently had significant improvements in the TestWell Wellness Inventory from pretest to posttest. The subgroups in the social awareness and spirituality inventories showed significant improvement in the intervention group. In a subgroup of participants (11/49, 22%) where the GAD-7 was available during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in anxiety from the start of the study (mean score 11.63, SD 2.16) to mid-March (ie, onset of the pandemic) (mean score 13.03, SD 1.48; P=.23), followed by a significant decrease at the end of the study period (mean score 5.9, SD 1.44; P=.001).\nIt is possible to deliver EI and mindfulness training in a scalable way using the Ajivar app during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in improvements in anxiety, depression, and EI in the college student population.", "The COVID-19 global pandemic is a threat not only to the health of millions of individuals, but also to the stability of infrastructure and economies around the world. The disease will inevitably place an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems that cannot be effectively dealt with by existing facilities or responses based on conventional approaches. We believe that a rigorous clinical and societal response can only be mounted by using intelligence derived from a variety of data sources to better utilize scarce healthcare resources, provide personalized patient management plans, inform policy, and expedite clinical trials. In this paper, we introduce five of the most important challenges in responding to COVID-19 and show how each of them can be addressed by recent developments in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that the integration of these techniques into local, national, and international healthcare systems will save lives, and propose specific methods by which implementation can happen swiftly and efficiently. We offer to extend these resources and knowledge to assist policymakers seeking to implement these techniques.", "Youth involves a lot of mental health issues. A descriptive cross-sectional study was undertaken to determine the relationship between emotional intelligence, self-esteem, and assertiveness among 432 youth (18-23 years) from selected colleges of Udupi district, Karnataka using Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test, Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and Youth Assertiveness Scale. The mean emotional intelligence among youth was 124.99 \u00b1 18.71, whereas the mean self-esteem and assertiveness scores were 18.48 \u00b1 3.33 and 60.706 \u00b1 7.077, respectively. Linear relationships among the key variables were assessed using the Karl Pearson's correlation coefficient. Self-esteem and assertiveness showed a weak positive relationship (r = 0.282 and 0.288, P = 0.001 respectively) with emotional intelligence, whereas the relationship between self-esteem and assertiveness also revealed a positive relationship (r = 0.367, P = 0.001). The significant correlation between these variables indicates a need for regular assessment among the youth. Rising self-esteem and training in assertiveness help the individual to use his emotions wisely and improve emotional intelligence.", "Situational judgment tests (SJTs) are used in health sciences education to measure examinee knowledge using case-based scenarios. Despite their popularity, there is a significant gap in the validity research on the response process that demonstrates how SJTs measure their intended constructs. A model of SJT response processes has been proposed in the literature by Robert Ployhart; however, few studies have explored and expanded the factors. The purpose of this study was to describe the factors involved in cognitive processes that examinees use as they respond to SJT items in a health professions education context.\nThirty participants-15 student pharmacists and 15 practicing pharmacists-completed a 12-item SJT designed to measure empathy. Each participant engaged in a think-aloud interview while completing the SJT, followed by a cognitive interview probing their decision-making processes. Interviews were transcribed and independently coded by three researchers to identify salient factors that contributed to response processes.\nThe findings suggest SJT response processes include all four stages (comprehension, retrieval, judgment, and response selection) as initially proposed by Ployhart. The study showed factors from other published research were present, including job-specific knowledge and experiences, emotional intelligence, and test-taking. The study also identified new factors not yet described, including identifying a task objective in the scenario, assumptions about the scenario, perceptions about the scenario, and the setting of the item.\nThis study provides additional SJT validity evidence by exploring participants' response processes through cognitive and think-aloud interviews. It also confirmed the four-stage model previously described by Ployhart and identified new factors that may influence SJT response processes. This study contributes to the literature with an expanded SJT response process model in a health professions education context and offers an approach to evaluate SJT response processes in the future.", "Artificial intelligence holds great promise for improved health-care outcomes. But it also poses substantial new hazards, including algorithmic discrimination. For example, an algorithm used to identify candidates for beneficial \"high risk care management\" programs routinely failed to select racial minorities. Furthermore, some algorithms deliberately adjust for race in ways that divert resources away from minority patients. To illustrate, algorithms have underestimated African Americans' risks of kidney stones and death from heart failure. Algorithmic discrimination can violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act when it unjustifiably disadvantages underserved populations. This article urges that both legal and technical tools be deployed to promote AI fairness. Plaintiffs should be able to assert disparate impact claims in health-care litigation, and Congress should enact an Algorithmic Accountability Act. In addition, fairness should be a key element in designing, implementing, validating, and employing AI.", "Exposure to inorganic arsenic through drinking water is a threat for public health. Using the arsenic-containing water in the long-term causes a variety of skin diseases, high blood pressure, and skin cancer. Arsenic also damages the nervous system. A wide range of studies have studied the effect of arsenic in drinking water on the level of intelligence in children.\nFor the purpose of our research, we searched three electronic databases including Scopus, Web of Science, and Medline (PubMed) in English from 2000 to January 2018. We used the dose-response meta-analysis through applying random effect models in order to estimate the pooled association (with a 95% uncertainty) between water arsenic concentration and intelligence level.\nUsing a two-stage random effect model to investigate the dose-response association between arsenic concentration and Intelligence Quotient scale, we estimated a significant linear association as -0.08 (95% CI: -0.14, -0.01). Actually, for each unit increase in arsenic concentration (one microgram per liter), intelligence quotient scale decreases by 0.08%.\nConsidering the significance of the relationship between arsenic concentration in drinking water and the level of intelligence quotient as an important factor in training, the level of arsenic and its associated risks should be decreased in water resources.", "Humans are notoriously bad at understanding probabilities, exhibiting a host of biases and distortions that are context dependent. This has serious consequences on how we assess risks and make decisions. Several theories have been developed to replace the normative rational expectation theory at the foundation of economics. These approaches essentially assume that (subjective) probabilities weight multiplicatively the utilities of the alternatives offered to the decision maker, although evidence suggest that probability weights and utilities are often not separable in the mind of the decision maker. In this context, we introduce a simple and efficient framework on how to describe the inherently probabilistic human decision-making process, based on a representation of the deliberation activity leading to a choice through stochastic processes, the simplest of which is a random walk. Our model leads naturally to the hypothesis that probabilities and utilities are entangled dual characteristics of the real human decision making process. It predicts the famous fourfold pattern of risk preferences. Through the analysis of choice probabilities, it is possible to identify two previously postulated features of prospect theory: the inverse S-shaped subjective probability as a function of the objective probability and risk-seeking behavior in the loss domain. It also predicts observed violations of stochastic dominance, while it does not when the dominance is \"evident\". Extending the model to account for human finite deliberation time and the effect of time pressure on choice, it provides other sound predictions: inverse relation between choice probability and response time, preference reversal with time pressure, and an inverse double-S-shaped probability weighting function. Our theory, which offers many more predictions for future tests, has strong implications for psychology, economics and artificial intelligence.", "Background: Acute appendicitis represents the most frequent reason for abdominal surgery in children. Since diagnosis can be challenging various scoring systems have been published. The aim of this study was to evaluate and validate (and improve) different appendicitis scores in a very large cohort of children with abdominal pain. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all children that have been hospitalized due to suspected appendicitis at the Pediatric Surgery Department of the Altonaer Children's Hospital and University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf from 01/2018 until 11/2019. Four different appendicitis scores (Heidelberg Appendicitis Score, Alvarado Score, Pediatric Appendicitis Score and Tzanakis Score) were applied to all data sets. Furthermore, the best score was improved and artificial intelligence (AI) was applied and compare the current scores. Results: In 23 months, 463 patients were included in the study. Of those 348 (75.2%) were operated for suspected appendicitis and in 336 (96.6%) patients the diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically. The best predictors of appendicitis (simple and perforated) were rebound tenderness, cough/hopping tenderness, ultrasound, and laboratory results. After modifying the HAS, it provided excellent results for simple (PPV 95.0%, NPV 70.0%) and very good for perforated appendicitis (PPV 34.4%, NPV 93.8%), outperforming all other appendicitis score. Discussion: The modified HAS and the AI score show excellent predictive capabilities and may be used to identify most cases of appendicitis and more important to rule out perforated appendicitis. The new scores outperform all other scores and are simple to apply. The modified HAS comprises five features that can all be assessed in the emergency department as opposed to current scores that are relatively complex to utilize in a clinical setting as they include of up to eight features with various weighting factors. In conclusion, the modified HAS and the AI score may be used to identify children with appendicitis, yet prospective studies to validate our findings in a large mutli-center cohorts are needed.", "In the current research paper a novel hybrid model combining first-principle and artificial intelligence (AI) was developed for simulation of a chemical reactor. We study a 2-dimensional reactor with heating sources inside it by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The type of considered reactor is bubble column reactor (BCR) in which a two-phase system is created. Results from CFD were analyzed in two different stages. The first stage, which is the learning stage, takes advantage of the swarm intelligence of the ant colony. The second stage results from the first stage, and in this stage, the predictions are according to the previous stage. This stage is related to the fuzzy logic system, and the ant colony optimization learning framework is build-up this part of the model. Ants movements or swarm intelligence of ants lead to the optimization of physical, chemical, or any kind of processes in nature. From point to point optimization, we can access a kind of group optimization, meaning that a group of data is studied and optimized. In the current study, the swarm intelligence of ants was used to learn the data from CFD in different parts of the BCR. The learning was also used to map the input and output data and find out the complex connection between the parameters. The results from mapping the input and output data show the full learning framework. By using the AI framework, the learning process was transferred into the fuzzy logic process through membership function specifications; therefore, the fuzzy logic system could predict a group of data. The results from the swarm intelligence of ants and fuzzy logic suitably adapt to CFD results. Also, the ant colony optimization fuzzy inference system (ACOFIS) model is employed to predict the temperature distribution in the reactor based on the CFD results. The results indicated that instead of solving Navier-Stokes equations and complex solving procedures, the swarm intelligence could be used to predict a process. For better comparisons and assessment of the ACOFIS model, this model is compared with the genetic algorithm fuzzy inference system (GAFIS) and Particle swarm optimization fuzzy inference system (PSOFIS) method with regards to model accuracy, pattern recognition, and prediction capability. All models are at a similar level of accuracy and prediction ability, and the prediction time for all models is less than one second. The results show that the model's accuracy with low computational learning time can be achieved with the high number of CIR (0.5) when the number of inputs\u2009\u2265\u20094. However, this finding is vice versa, when the number of inputs\u2009<\u20094. In this case, the CIR number should be 0.2 to achieve the best accuracy of the model. This finding could also highlight the importance of sensitivity analysis of tuning parameters to achieve an accurate model with a cost-effective computational run.", "Background: The clinical suspicion of Congenital Hypothyroidism (CH) is identified by abnormal results in the first test of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) (5-9.9 mIU/L), and normal results in re-test (TSH<4 mIU/L). The CH has a contribution to physical and mental health. This study aimed to determine the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) score in children with suspected congenital hypothyroidism. Methods: This research is a retrospective cohort study conducted in Mashhad, Iran. The IQ scores of 1976 children at the age of 6 were considered as an outcome variable. The history of CH screening for each newborn was assessed, then all suspected CH newborns that diagnosed healthy in re-test were considered as an exposed group, the effects of this situation on IQ score was assessed using logistic regression. All analysis was performed in STATA. Results: The averages of IQ score (p<0.001), weight (p=0.024), and height (p<0.001) in the exposed group were lower than the unexposed group. The exposed group was related to those whose parental education was less or equal to 12 years (p<0.001). Similarly, the history of CH and maternal education for \u226412 years were detected as risk factors for having an IQ score of <90 in children. Conclusion: Aside from the link between parental education and clinical suspicion of CH in neonates, our findings underline the possible strong effect of CH status and maternal education for \u226412 years on reducing IQ scores in the next years of child life.", "As laboratory medicine continues to undergo digitalization and automation, clinical laboratorians will likely be confronted with the challenges associated with artificial intelligence (AI). Understanding what AI is good for, how to evaluate it, what are its limitations, and how it can be implemented are not well understood. With a survey, we aimed to evaluate the thoughts of stakeholders in laboratory medicine on the value of AI in the diagnostics space and identify anticipated challenges and solutions to introducing AI.\nWe conducted a web-based survey on the use of AI with participants from Roche's Strategic Advisory Network that included key stakeholders in laboratory medicine.\nIn total, 128 of 302 stakeholders responded to the survey. Most of the participants were medical practitioners (26%) or laboratory managers (22%). AI is currently used in the organizations of 15.6%, while 66.4% felt they might use it in the future. Most had an unsure attitude on what they would need to adopt AI in the diagnostics space. High investment costs, lack of proven clinical benefits, number of decision makers, and privacy concerns were identified as barriers to adoption. Education in the value of AI, streamlined implementation and integration into existing workflows, and research to prove clinical utility were identified as solutions needed to mainstream AI in laboratory medicine.\nThis survey demonstrates that specific knowledge of AI in the medical community is poor and that AI education is much needed. One strategy could be to implement new AI tools alongside existing tools.", "The goal was to identify the domain-general cognitive abilities and academic attitudes that are common and unique to reading and mathematics learning difficulties that in turn will have implications for intervention development. Across seventh and eighth grade, 315 (155 boys) adolescents (M age = 12.75 years) were administered intelligence, verbal short-term and working memory, and visuospatial memory, attention, and ability measures, along with measures of English and mathematics attitudes and mathematics anxiety. Teachers reported on students' in-class attentive behavior. A combination of Bayesian and multi-level models revealed that intelligence and in-class attentive behavior were common predictors of reading accuracy, reading fluency, and mathematics achievement. Verbal short-term memory was more critical for reading accuracy and fluency, whereas spatial ability and mathematics self-efficacy were more critical for mathematics achievement. The combination of intelligence and in-class attentive behavior discriminated typically achieving students from students with comorbid (D = 2.44) or mathematics (D = 1.59) learning difficulties, whereas intelligence, visuospatial attention, and verbal short-term memory discriminated typically achieving students from students with reading disability (D = 1.08). The combination of in-class attentive behavior, verbal short-term memory, and mathematics self-efficacy discriminated students with mathematics difficulties from their peers with reading difficulties (D = 1.16). Given the consistent importance of in-class attentive behavior, we conducted post hoc follow-up analyses. The results suggested that students with poor in-class attentive behavior were disengaging from academic learning which in turn contributed to their risk of learning difficulties.", "Colonic perfusion status can be assessed easily by indocyanine green (ICG) angiography to predict ischemia related anastomotic complications during laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Recently, various parameter-based perfusion analysis have been studied for quantitative evaluation, but the analysis results differ depending on the use of quantitative parameters due to differences in vascular anatomical structure. Therefore, it can help improve the accuracy and consistency by artificial intelligence (AI) based real-time analysis microperfusion (AIRAM).\nTo evaluate the feasibility of AIRAM to predict the risk of anastomotic complication in the patient with laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.\nThe ICG curve was extracted from the region of interest (ROI) set in the ICG fluorescence video of the laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Pre-processing was performed to reduce AI performance degradation caused by external environment such as background, light source reflection, and camera shaking using MATLAB 2019 on an I7-8700k Intel central processing unit (CPU) PC. AI learning and evaluation were performed by dividing into a training patient group (n = 50) and a test patient group (n = 15). Training ICG curve data sets were classified and machine learned into 25 ICG curve patterns using a self-organizing map (SOM) network. The predictive reliability of anastomotic complications in a trained SOM network is verified using test set.\nAI-based risk and the conventional quantitative parameters including T 1/2max , time ratio (TR), and rising slope (RS) were consistent when colonic perfusion was favorable as steep increasing ICG curve pattern. When the ICG graph pattern showed stepped rise, the accuracy of conventional quantitative parameters decreased, but the AI-based classification maintained accuracy consistently. The receiver operating characteristic curves for conventional parameters and AI-based classification were comparable for predicting the anastomotic complication risks. Statistical performance verifications were improved in the AI-based analysis. AI analysis was evaluated as the most accurate parameter to predict the risk of anastomotic complications. The F1 score of the AI-based method increased by 31% for T 1/2max , 8% for TR, and 8% for RS. The processing time of AIRAM was measured as 48.03 s, which was suitable for real-time processing.\nIn conclusion, AI-based real-time microcirculation analysis had more accurate and consistent performance than the conventional parameter-based method.", "Over the past 20 years, there has been rapid growth in interventions to improve the safety of people who receive care. These have focused on process and developing interventions to address the risks that people face when they are treated either in the community or in hospital. It is clear that the improvement in safety is evident, though not uniform, and that the challenge is more than one of improving process but more complex. In this chapter, four key areas are covered. The concept of culture and language is the foundation for safety and a change in culture is the first step. This will then include the development of psychological safety and well-being for people who deliver care, and co-production of safety with those who receive care. The social determinants of safety require further delineation and research. Finally, harnessing the potential of the new technologies and artifical intelligence will be the next step in developing as harm free care as is possible. Redesign of healthcare delivery is essential.", "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most serious health disorders with increasing prevalence and high morbidity and mortality. Although diagnosis and treatment of CVD have achieved huge breakthrough in recent years, it still needs additional enhancements, which result in the demand for new techniques. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging science field that has been widely used to guide diseases diagnosis, evaluation and treatment. AI techniques are promising in CVD to explore novel pathogenic genes phenotype, guide optimal individualized therapeutic strategy, improve the management and quality of discharged patients, predict disease prognosis, and as adjuvant therapy tool. Thus, we summarize the latest application of AI techniques in clinical diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of CVD, aiming to provide novel beneficial evidence of AI and promote its application in CVD.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has huge potential to improve the health and well-being of people, but adoption in clinical practice is still limited. Lack of transparency is identified as one of the main barriers to implementation, as clinicians should be confident the AI system can be trusted. Explainable AI has the potential to overcome this issue and can be a step towards trustworthy AI. In this paper we review the recent literature to provide guidance to researchers and practitioners on the design of explainable AI systems for the health-care domain and contribute to formalization of the field of explainable AI. We argue the reason to demand explainability determines what should be explained as this determines the relative importance of the properties of explainability (i.e. interpretability and fidelity). Based on this, we propose a framework to guide the choice between classes of explainable AI methods (explainable modelling versus post-hoc explanation; model-based, attribution-based, or example-based explanations; global and local explanations). Furthermore, we find that quantitative evaluation metrics, which are important for objective standardized evaluation, are still lacking for some properties (e.g. clarity) and types of explanations (e.g. example-based methods). We conclude that explainable modelling can contribute to trustworthy AI, but the benefits of explainability still need to be proven in practice and complementary measures might be needed to create trustworthy AI in health care (e.g. reporting data quality, performing extensive (external) validation, and regulation).", "This review describes the steps and conclusions from the development and validation of an artificial intelligence algorithm (the Hypotension Prediction Index), one of the first machine learning predictive algorithms used in the operating room environment. The algorithm has been demonstrated to reduce intraoperative hypotension in two randomized controlled trials via real-time prediction of upcoming hypotensive events prompting anesthesiologists to act earlier, more often, and differently in managing impending hypotension. However, the algorithm entails no dynamic learning process that evolves from use in clinical patient care, meaning the algorithm is fixed, and furthermore provides no insight into the decisional process that leads to an early warning for intraoperative hypotension, which makes the algorithm a \"black box.\" Many other artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms have these same disadvantages. Clinical validation of such algorithms is relatively new and requires more standardization, as guidelines are lacking or only now start to be drafted. Before adaptation in clinical practice, impact of artificial intelligence algorithms on clinical behavior, outcomes and economic advantages should be studied too.", "Previous studies have found that emotional intelligence has a remarkable influence on authentic leadership. However, the conceivable relationship between emotional intelligence and authentic leadership was unclear, as were the hypothetical bases used in previous studies.\nTo determine the correlation between emotional intelligence and authentic leadership of the nursing leaders and the socio-demographic characteristics by which emotional intelligence and authentic leadership vary.\nData derived from 152 of the distributed 180 questionnaires were analyzed (84.44% response rate). Nurse leaders in the academy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were assessed from April to July of 2019. t-Tests were used to test gender differences, while the Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were employed for age, position, and years of experience. The relationship between the emotional intelligence and authentic leadership scores was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficients (bivariate r). The relationships of the four dimensions in the emotional intelligence construct and overall emotional intelligence were assessed using multiple regression analysis and simple linear regression analysis.\nAge and years of experience significantly and positively related to emotional intelligence, whereas gender, age, and years of experience in the current position (p\u202f=\u202f0.026) were significant regarding authentic leadership. The emotional intelligence total score strongly and positively related to authentic leadership. The regression results on the four emotional intelligence dimensions indicated that the extent of using emotions had the strongest influence on authentic leadership (B\u202f=\u202f0.99) followed by appraisal of one's emotions (B\u202f=\u202f0.70) and appraisal of others' emotions (B\u202f=\u202f0.69). The simple regression analysis indicated that, for every one-point increase in total emotional intelligence score, authentic leadership score increased by 0.086.\nAge and years of experience were significant factors explaining variation in emotional intelligence, whereas gender, age, and years of experience in the current position were significant for explaining variation in authentic leadership. Using emotions was the strongest influence on authentic leadership, and the emotional intelligence dimension measuring regulation of emotion had no significant influence on authentic leadership.", "Form last few decades, nanoparticles have witnessed breakthroughs in the treatment of neurological disorders due to their unique physiochemical properties, which make them an effective drug delivery system. However, there is not much information available on the toxicity of nanoparticles in neuronal disorders. The toxic effect of nanoparticles on brain disorders and their regulatory issues are the primary concerns of the healthcare industry.\nA strategical literature search was performed on various bibliographic databases such as Scopus, PubMed, SciFinder, Google Scholar, Medline, Google Patent, Derwent Innovation, and Orbit Intelligence for retrieval of peer-reviewed articles and patents on regulatory issues and toxicity of nanoparticles in neuronal disorders for last decade. The relevant hits of articles and patents were analyzed, and citation search for the relevant documents was carried out.\nThe literature documents have been summarized regarding the existing regulatory issues and toxicity of nanoparticles on neuronal disorders with a focus on the detailed mechanism of the developmental toxicity of nanoparticles. The focus of this report is to emphasize the negative effects of nanoparticle on neuronal disorders, which may partially contribute to the management of toxicity of nanoparticles.\nAlthough nanoparticles have unique physical and chemical properties that explain the broad range of application for the central nervous system, they can also manifest neurotoxic effects due to cell necrosis, generation of free radicals, immune responses and neuroinflammation. Thus, this review highlights risk assessment, safety regulations and regulatory guidelines of nanoparticles, which may reduce adverse reactions in humans and animals.", "Corpus callosotomy (CC) is an established surgical option for palliative treatment of medically intractable epilepsy, especially for seizures with drop attacks. We postulated that specific risk factors for post-CC transient disturbance of consciousness (pCTDC) are associated with CC. The purpose of this study was to review patients with intractable epilepsy who underwent CC and to statistically analyze risk factors for pCTDC.\nInclusion criteria for patients who underwent CC between January 2009 and November 2019 were: (1) \u22652\u202fyears old and (2) followed up for more than 8\u202fmonths. The state of consciousness before and after CC was evaluated with the Glasgow coma scale. We statistically assessed predictors for pCTDC as the primary outcome.\nFifty-six patients (19 females, 37 males) were enrolled, and the age range was 2-57\u202fyears old. Thirty-seven (66.1%) patients developed pCTDC. The mean period from the beginning of the state of pCTDC to recovery to their baseline conscious level was 4.9\u202fdays (range: 2-25\u202fdays). All three (100%) normal intelligence level patients, 13 (81%) of 16 patients with a moderately impaired level of intelligence, and 21 (57%) of 37 patients with a severely impaired level of intelligence exhibited pCTDC. Univariate (p\u202f=\u202f0.044) and multivariate (p\u202f=\u202f0.006) logistic regression analyses for predictors of pCTDC showed that intellectual function was statistically significant.\nTwo-thirds of patients developed pCTDC. One risk factor for pCTDC may be higher intellectual function.", "Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Many studies based on fundus image and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging have been developed in the literature to help ophthalmologists through artificial-intelligence techniques. Currently, 3D spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) samples have become more important since they could enclose promising information for glaucoma detection. To analyse the hidden knowledge of the 3D scans for glaucoma detection, we have proposed, for the first time, a deep-learning methodology based on leveraging the spatial dependencies of the features extracted from the B-scans.\nThe experiments were performed on a database composed of 176 healthy and 144 glaucomatous SD-OCT volumes centred on the optic nerve head (ONH). The proposed methodology consists of two well-differentiated training stages: a slide-level feature extractor and a volume-based predictive model. The slide-level discriminator is characterised by two new, residual and attention, convolutional modules which are combined via skip-connections with other fine-tuned architectures. Regarding the second stage, we first carried out a data-volume conditioning before extracting the features from the slides of the SD-OCT volumes. Then, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks were used to combine the recurrent dependencies embedded in the latent space to provide a holistic feature vector, which was generated by the proposed sequential-weighting module (SWM).\nThe feature extractor reports AUC values higher than 0.93 both in the primary and external test sets. Otherwise, the proposed end-to-end system based on a combination of CNN and LSTM networks achieves an AUC of 0.8847 in the prediction stage, which outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches intended for glaucoma detection. Additionally, Class Activation Maps (CAMs) were computed to highlight the most interesting regions per B-scan when discerning between healthy and glaucomatous eyes from raw SD-OCT volumes.\nThe proposed model is able to extract the features from the B-scans of the volumes and combine the information of the latent space to perform a volume-level glaucoma prediction. Our model, which combines residual and attention blocks with a sequential weighting module to refine the LSTM outputs, surpass the results achieved from current state-of-the-art methods focused on 3D deep-learning architectures.", "Glaucoma, the group of eye diseases is characterized by increased intraocular pressure, optic neuropathy and visual field defect patterns. Early and correct diagnosis of glaucoma can prevent irreversible vision loss and glaucomatous structural damages to the eye. However, greater chances of misdiagnosis by the currently used conventional methods for diagnosis open up ways for more advanced techniques like the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial intelligence coupled with optical coherence tomography imaging creates an algorithm that can be effectively used to make a model of complex data for detection as well as diagnosis of glaucoma. The present review is an attempt to provide state-of-the-art information on various AI techniques used in the diagnosis and assessment of glaucoma. The second part of the review is focused on understanding how the AI along with machine learning (ML) can be potentially used to be subjected for software as a medical device (SaMD) in precise diagnosis or early detection of disease conditions.", "We combined clinical practice changes, standardizations, and technology to automate aggregation, integration, and harmonization of comprehensive patient data from the multiple source systems used in clinical practice into a big data analytics resource system (BDARS). We then developed novel artificial intelligence algorithms, coupled with the BDARS, to identify structure dose volume histograms (DVH) metrics associated with dysphagia.\nFrom the BDARS harmonized data of \u226522,000 patients, we identified 132 patients recently treated for head and neck cancer who also demonstrated dysphagia scores that worsened from base line to a maximum grade \u22652. We developed a method that used both physical and biologically corrected (\u03b1/\u03b2 = 2.5) DVH curves to test both absolute and percentage volume based DVH metrics. Combining a statistical categorization algorithm with machine learning (SCA-ML) provided more extensive detailing of response threshold evidence than either approach alone. A sensitivity guided, minimum input, machine learning (ML) model was iteratively constructed to identify the key structure DVH metric thresholds.\nSeven swallowing structures producing 738 candidate DVH metrics were ranked for association with dysphagia using SCA-ML scoring. Structures included superior pharyngeal constrictor (SPC), inferior pharyngeal constrictor (IPC), larynx, and esophagus. Bilateral parotid and submandibular gland (SG) structures were categorized by relative mean dose (eg, SG_high, SG_low) as a dose versus tumor centric analog to contra and ipsilateral designations. Structure DVH metrics with high SCA-ML scores included the following: SPC: D20% (equivalent dose [EQD2] Gy) \u226547.7; SPC: D25% (Gy) \u226550.4; IPC: D35% (Gy) \u226561.7; parotid_low: D60% (Gy) \u226513.2; and SG_high: D35% (Gy) \u226561.7. Larynx: D25% (Gy) \u226521.2 and SG_low: D45% \u226528.2 had high SCA-ML scores but were segmented on less than 90% of plans. A model based on SPC: D20% (EQD2 Gy) alone had sensitivity and area under the curve of 0.88 \u00b1 0.13 and 0.74 \u00b1 0.17, respectively.\nThis study provides practical demonstration of combining big data with artificial intelligence to increase volume of evidence in clinical learning paradigms.", "The magnocellular-dorsal system is well isolated by high temporal frequency. However, temporal processing thresholds have seldom been explored in developmental dyslexia nor its subtypes. Hence, performances on two, four-alternative forced-choice achromatic flicker fusion threshold tasks modulated at low (5%) and high (75%) temporal contrast were compared in dyslexic and neurotypical children individually matched for age and intelligence (8-12\u00a0years, n\u2009=\u200954 per group). As expected, the higher modulation resulted in higher flicker fusion thresholds in both groups. Compared to neurotypicals, the dyslexic group displayed significantly lower ability to detect flicker at high temporal frequencies, both at low and high temporal contrast. Yet, discriminant analysis did not adequately distinguish the dyslexics from neurotypicals, on the basis of flicker thresholds alone. Rather, two distinct dyslexic subgroups were identified by cluster analysis - one characterised by significantly lower temporal frequency thresholds than neurotypicals (referred to as 'Magnocellular-Deficit' dyslexics; 53.7%), while the other group ('Magnocellular-Typical' dyslexics; 46.3%) had comparable thresholds to neurotypicals. The two dyslexic subgroups were not differentially associated with phonological or naming speed subtypes and showed comparable mean reading rate impairments. However, correlations between low modulation flicker fusion threshold and reading rate for the two subgroups were significantly different (p\u2009=\u2009.0009). Flicker fusion threshold performances also showed strong classification accuracy (79.3%) in dissociating the Magnocellular-Deficit dyslexics and neurotypicals. We propose that temporal visual processing impairments characterize a previously unidentified subgroup of dyslexia and suggest that measurement of flicker fusion thresholds could be used clinically to assist early diagnosis and appropriate treatment recommendations for dyslexia.", "The aim of this study was to discuss the status of and perspective for biomarker validation in view of the challenges imposed on national healthcare systems due to an increasing number of citizens with chronic diseases and new expensive drugs with effects that are sometimes poorly documented. The demand for a paradigm shift toward stratification of patients or even 'personalized medicine' (PM) is rising, and the implementation of such novel strategies has the potential to increase patient outcomes and cost efficiency of treatments. The implementation of PM depends on relevant and reliable biomarkers correlated to disease states, prognosis, or effect of treatment. Beyond biomarkers of disease, personalized prevention strategies (such as individualized nutrition guidance) are likely to depend on novel biomarkers.\nWe discuss the current status of the use of biomarkers and the need for standardization and integration of biomarkers based on multi-omics approaches.\nWe present representative cases from laboratory medicine, oncology, and nutrition, where present and emerging biomarkers have or may present opportunities for PM or prevention.\nBiomarkers vary greatly in complexity, from single genomic mutations to metagenomic analyses of the composition of the gut microbiota and comprehensive analyses of metabolites, metabolomics. Using biomarkers for decision-making has previously often relied on measurements of single biomolecules. The current development now moves toward the use of multiple biomarkers requiring the use of machine learning or artificial intelligence. Still, the usefulness of biomarkers is often challenged by suboptimal validation, and the discovery of new biomarkers moves much faster than standardization efforts. To reap the potential benefits of personalization of treatment and prevention, healthcare systems and regulatory authorities need to focus on validation and standardization of biomarkers.\nThere is a great public health need for better understanding of the usefulness, but also limitations, of biomarkers among policy makers, clinicians, and scientists, and efforts securing effective validation are key to the future use of novel sets of complex biomarkers.", "Computed tomography (CT) is a central modality in modern radiology contributing to diagnostic medicine in almost every medical subspecialty, but particularly in emergency services. To solve the inverse problem of reconstructing anatomical slice images from the raw output the scanner measures, several methods have been developed, with filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction (IR) subsequently providing criterion standards. Currently there are new approaches to reconstruction in the field of artificial intelligence utilizing the upcoming possibilities of machine learning (ML), or more specifically, deep learning (DL).\nThis review covers the principles of present CT image reconstruction as well as the basic concepts of DL and its implementation in reconstruction. Subsequently commercially available algorithms and current limitations are being discussed.\nDL is an ML method that utilizes a trained artificial neural network to solve specific problems. Currently two vendors are providing DL image reconstruction algorithms for the clinical routine. For these algorithms, a decrease in image noise and an increase in overall image quality that could potentially facilitate the diagnostic confidence in lesion conspicuity or may translate to dose reduction for given clinical tasks have been shown. One study showed equal diagnostic accuracy in the detection of coronary artery stenosis for DL reconstructed images compared to IR at higher image quality levels. Consequently, a lot more research is necessary and should aim at diagnostic superiority in the clinical context covering a broadness of pathologies to demonstrate the reliability of such DL approaches.\n\u00b7 Following iterative reconstruction, there is a new approach to CT image reconstruction in the clinical routine using deep learning (DL) as a method of artificial intelligence.. \u00b7 DL image reconstruction algorithms decrease image noise, improve image quality, and have potential to reduce radiation dose.. \u00b7 Diagnostic superiority in the clinical context should be demonstrated in future trials..\n\u00b7 Arndt C, G\u00fcttler F, Heinrich A et\u200aal.

Die Berechnung bzw. Rekonstruktion von Schnittbildern aus den rohen Messwerten der CT-Untersuchungen stellt mathematisch ein inverses Problem dar.

The core issues include the relative contribution of mitochondrial functioning to individual differences in g; studies that can be used to test associated hypotheses; and, the adaptive function of intelligence from an evolutionary perspective. I attempt to address these and related issues, as well as note areas in which other issues remain to be addressed.", "Gleason grading is the standard diagnostic method for prostate cancer and is essential for determining prognosis and treatment. The dearth of expert pathologists, the inter- and intraobserver variability, as well as the labour intensity of Gleason grading all necessitate the development of a user-friendly tool for robust standardisation.\nTo develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, based on machine learning and convolutional neural networks, as a tool for improved standardisation in Gleason grading in prostate cancer biopsies.\nA total of 698 prostate biopsy sections from 174 patients were used for training. The training sections were annotated by two senior consultant pathologists. The final algorithm was tested on 37 biopsy sections from 21 patients, with digitised slide images from two different scanners.\nCorrelation, sensitivity, and specificity parameters were calculated.\nThe algorithm shows high accuracy in detecting cancer areas (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 68%). Compared with the pathologists, the algorithm also performed well in detecting cancer areas (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.99) and assigning the Gleason patterns correctly: Gleason patterns 3 and 4 (ICC: 0.96 and 0.94, respectively), and to a lesser extent, Gleason pattern 5 (ICC: 0.82). Similar results were obtained using two different scanners.\nOur AI-based algorithm can reliably detect prostate cancer and quantify the Gleason patterns in core needle biopsies, with similar accuracy as pathologists. The results are reproducible on images from different scanners with a proven low level of intraobserver variability. We believe that this AI tool could be regarded as an efficient and interactive tool for pathologists.\nWe developed a sensitive artificial intelligence tool for prostate biopsies, which detects and grades cancer with similar accuracy to pathologists. This tool holds promise to improve the diagnosis of prostate cancer.", "Human movement is one of the forces that drive the spatial spread of infectious diseases. To date, reducing and tracking human movement during the COVID-19 pandemic has proven effective in limiting the spread of the virus. Existing methods for monitoring and modeling the spatial spread of infectious diseases rely on various data sources as proxies of human movement, such as airline travel data, mobile phone data, and banknote tracking. However, intrinsic limitations of these data sources prevent us from systematic monitoring and analyses of human movement on different spatial scales (from local to global).\nBig data from social media such as geotagged tweets have been widely used in human mobility studies, yet more research is needed to validate the capabilities and limitations of using such data for studying human movement at different geographic scales (eg, from local to global) in the context of global infectious disease transmission. This study aims to develop a novel data-driven public health approach using big data from Twitter coupled with other human mobility data sources and artificial intelligence to monitor and analyze human movement at different spatial scales (from global to regional to local).\nWe will first develop a database with optimized spatiotemporal indexing to store and manage the multisource data sets collected in this project. This database will be connected to our in-house Hadoop computing cluster for efficient big data computing and analytics. We will then develop innovative data models, predictive models, and computing algorithms to effectively extract and analyze human movement patterns using geotagged big data from Twitter and other human mobility data sources, with the goal of enhancing situational awareness and risk prediction in public health emergency response and disease surveillance systems.\nThis project was funded as of May 2020. We have started the data collection, processing, and analysis for the project.\nResearch findings can help government officials, public health managers, emergency responders, and researchers answer critical questions during the pandemic regarding the current and future infectious risk of a state, county, or community and the effectiveness of social/physical distancing practices in curtailing the spread of the virus.\nDERR1-10.2196/24432.", "We report the case of a 17-year-old girl with Tyrosinemia type 1a who carried a planned pregnancy to term while being under 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC, nitisinone) treatment and a tyrosine- and phenylalanine-restricted diet. She was on treatment since 2 months of age with poor metabolic control prior to her pregnancy (tyrosine 838\u2009\u00b1\u2009106 umol/L). NTBC and a low tyrosine and phenylalanine diet were continued during her pregnancy. She unfortunately suffered from urinary tract infection and anemia during her pregnancy, with median plasma tyrosine and phenylalanine levels of 613\u2009\u00b1\u2009106 umol/L (200-400 umol/L) and 40.2 \u00b1\u20098 umol/L (35-90 umol/L), respectively. After 40\u2009weeks of gestation, the patient gave birth to a healthy boy, with no adverse effects related to the use of NTBC. The newborn presented with a transitory elevation of plasma tyrosine levels and normal phenylalanine, methionine, and succinylacetone levels. By 12\u2009months of age, the child was determined to have normal psychomotor development. At 20\u2009months old, he was diagnosed with a mild developmental delay; however, global cognitive evaluation with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) test at 5\u2009years old showed normal performance.

Patients were stratified into three clusters according to clinical outcome at the time of data collection, including developmental, clinical, and IQ data. A fourth cluster comprised of two early childhood deaths; a third patient died as an adult. We present neuroimaging and electroencephalography together with clinical and biochemical data. Incidence of MSUD (1972-2018) was 1 in 147\u2009975. Overall good clinical outcomes were achieved with 15/18 patients alive and with essentially normal functioning (with only the lowest performing cluster lying beyond a single SD on their full scale intelligence quotient). Molecular genetic analysis revealed genotypes hitherto not reported, including a possible digenic inheritance state for the BCKDHA and DBT genes in one family. Treatment has been based on early implementation of emergency treatment, diet, close monitoring, and even dialysis in the setting of acute metabolic decompensation. A plasma leucine \u2265400\u2009\u03bcmol/L (outside therapeutic range) was more frequently observed in infancy or during adolescence, possibly due to infections, hormonal changes, or noncompliance. Children require careful management during metabolic decompensations in early childhood, and this represented a key risk period in our cohort. A high level of metabolic control can be achieved through diet with early implementation of a \"sick day\" regime and, in some cases, dialysis as a rescue therapy. The Irish cohort, despite largely classical phenotypes, achieved good outcomes in the NBS era, underlining the importance of early diagnosis and skilled multidisciplinary team management.", "We provide an overview on the use of biological assays to calibrate and initialize mechanism-based models of cancer phenomena. Although artificial intelligence methods currently dominate the landscape in computational oncology, mathematical models that seek to explicitly incorporate biological mechanisms into their formalism are of increasing interest. These models can guide experimental design and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of cancer progression. Historically, these models have included a myriad of parameters that have been difficult to quantify in biologically relevant systems, limiting their practical insights. Recently, however, there has been much interest calibrating biologically based models with the quantitative measurements available from (for example) RNA sequencing, time-resolved microscopy, and in\u00a0vivo imaging. In this contribution, we summarize how a variety of experimental methods quantify tumor characteristics from the molecular to tissue scales and describe how such data can be directly integrated with mechanism-based models to improve predictions of tumor growth and treatment response.", "The most common mesenchymal tumors are gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), which have malignant potential and can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal system.

Of the 29 studies, 17 were excluded due to their methodological quality. A final 12 studies were included in this review. Four themes demonstrated the value of drama in nursing education. These were an understanding of the patient experience, the development of professional identity, the enhancement of communication skills and increased self-reflection and critical thinking.\nInterpersonal skills are at the core of nursing and educational interventions that use drama can enhance the development of these skills.", "In this study, to address the problems of multiple dimensions, large scales, complex tension resource scheduling, and strict quality control requirements in the tensioning process of cables in prestressed steel structures, the technical characteristics of digital twins (DTs) and artificial intelligence (AI) are analyzed. An intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables method driven by the integration of DTs and AI is proposed. Based on the current research status of cable tensioning and DTs, combined with the goal of intelligent tensioning, a fusion mechanism for DTs and AI is established and their integration to drive intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables technology is analyzed. In addition, the key issues involved in the construction of an intelligent control center driven by the integration of DTs and AI are discussed. By considering the construction elements of space and time dimensions, the tensioning process is controlled at multiple levels, thereby realizing the intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables. Driven by intelligent tensioning methods, the safety performance evaluation of the intelligent tensioning process is analyzed. Combined with sensing equipment and intelligent algorithms, a high-fidelity twin model and three-dimensional integrated data model are constructed to realize closed-loop control of the intelligent tensioning safety evaluation. Through the study of digital twins and artificial intelligence fusion to drive the intelligent tensioning method for prestressed cables, this study focuses on the analysis of the intelligent evaluation of safety performance. This study provides a reference for fusion applications with DTs and AI in intelligent tensioning of prestressed cables.", "Although many researchers talk about a \"patient database,\" they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of curated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core, spreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data encapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefficient relative to relational database systems, which gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data fields are \"typed\" (that is, they contain specific kinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a \"key,\" it becomes impossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efficient ways, minimizing space and memory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called SQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data fields on very precise subsets of patients. Databases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efficient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data available in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data. Ultimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artificial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way heretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.", "Human evolution has regularly intersected with technology. Digitalization of various services has brought a paradigm shift in\u00a0consumerism. Treading this\u00a0path, mental health practice has gradually moved to Digital Mental Health Interventions (DMHI), to improve service access and delivery. Applied games are one such innovation that has gained recent popularity in psychiatry. Based on the principles of gamification, they\u00a0target psychosocial and cognitive domains, according to\u00a0the deficits in various psychiatric disorders. They have been used to deliver cognitive behaviour therapy, cognitive training and rehabilitation, behavioural modification, social motivation, attention enhancement, and biofeedback. Research shows their utility in ADHD, autistic spectrum disorders, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress, impulse control disorders, depression, schizophrenia, dementia, and even healthy aging. Virtual reality and artificial intelligence have been used in conjunction with gaming interventions to improvise their scope. Even though these interventions hold promise in engagement, ease of use, reduction of stigma, and bridging the mental-health gap, there are pragmatic challenges, especially in developing countries. These include network quality, infrastructure, feasibility, socio-cultural adaptability, and potential for abuse. Keeping this in the background, this review summarizes the scope, promise, and evidence of digital gaming in psychiatric practice, and highlights the potential caveats in their implementation.", "Artificial intelligence virtual health assistants are a promising emerging technology. This study is a process evaluation of a 12-week pilot physical activity and diet program delivered by virtual assistant \"Paola\". This single-arm repeated measures study (n = 28, aged 45-75 years) was evaluated on technical performance (accuracy of conversational exchanges), engagement (number of weekly check-ins completed), adherence (percentage of step goal and recommended food servings), and user feedback. Paola correctly asked scripted questions and responded to participants during the check-ins 97% and 96% of the time, respectively, but correctly responded to spontaneous exchanges only 21% of the time. Participants completed 63% of weekly check-ins and conducted a total of 3648 exchanges. Mean dietary adherence was 91% and was lowest for discretionary foods, grains, red meat, and vegetables. Participants met their step goal 59% of the time. Participants enjoyed the program and found Paola useful during check-ins but not for spontaneous exchanges. More in-depth knowledge, personalized advice and spontaneity were identified as important improvements. Virtual health assistants should ensure an adequate knowledge base and ability to recognize intents and entities, include personality and spontaneity, and provide ongoing technical troubleshooting of the virtual assistant to ensure the assistant remains effective.", "We investigated the cognitive and behavioral profile of three distinct groups of epilepsies with a genetic background for intergroup differences: (1) idiopathic/genetic generalized epilepsies (IGE/GGE group); (2) idiopathic focal epilepsies (IFE group); and (3) epilepsies with proven or strongly suggested monogenic or structural/numeric chromosomal etiology (genetic epilepsies, GE group). Cognitive (total IQ and subcategories) and behavioral parameters (CBCL) were assessed at the tertiary epilepsy center of the University of Munich (Germany). We used ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni-correction to explore significant mean differences and Fisher's exact test for significant proportional differences of intelligence impairment and behavioral problems. 126 (56 IGE/GGE, 26 IFE, 44 GE) patients were available. Total IQ was 89.0\u2009\u00b1\u200915.9 (95% CI 84.5-93.4) for IGE/GGE, 94.8\u2009\u00b1\u200918.1 (95% CI 87.3-102.3) for IFE and 76.4\u2009\u00b1\u200922.4 (95% CI 67.6-85.3) for GE (p\u2009=\u20090.001). The same trend was significant for all but one IQ subcategory. The rate of patients with an intelligence impairment (total IQ\u2009<\u200970) was higher for GE (40%) than for IGE/GGE (14%) and for IFE (7%) patients (p\u2009=\u20090.033). There were no significant differences between groups for behavior scores and behavioral problems. This study shows that the current ILAE classification of epilepsies with genetic etiology creates a heterogeneous group of patients with respect to cognitive performance but not behavior. These findings may help in further delineating epilepsies as regards cognitive performance, notwithstanding their closely related etiological classification.", "Aberrant metabolism is the root cause of several serious health issues, creating a huge burden to health and leading to diminished life expectancy. A dysregulated metabolism induces the secretion of several molecules which in turn trigger the inflammatory pathway. Inflammation is the natural reaction of the immune system to a variety of stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, and harmful substances. Metabolically triggered inflammation, also called metaflammation or low-grade chronic inflammation, is the consequence of a synergic interaction between the host and the exposome-a combination of environmental drivers, including diet, lifestyle, pollutants and other factors throughout the life span of an individual. Various levels of chronic inflammation are associated with several lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), cancers, cardiovascular disorders (CVDs), autoimmune diseases, and chronic lung diseases. Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, placing a heavy burden on individuals, families, governments, and health-care systems. New strategies are needed to empower communities worldwide to prevent and treat these diseases. Precision medicine provides a model for the next generation of lifestyle modification. This will capitalize on the dynamic interaction between an individual's biology, lifestyle, behavior, and environment. The aim of precision medicine is to design and improve diagnosis, therapeutics and prognostication through the use of large complex datasets that incorporate individual gene, function, and environmental variations. The implementation of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) can predict risks with greater accuracy based on available multidimensional clinical and biological datasets. AI-powered precision medicine provides clinicians with an opportunity to specifically tailor early interventions to each individual. In this article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing and evolving recent, data-driven technologies, such as AI, in preventing, treating and reversing lifestyle-related diseases.", "Fluorescein angiography (FA) is a procedure used to image the vascular structure of the retina and requires the insertion of an exogenous dye with potential adverse side effects. Currently, there is only one alternative non-invasive system based on Optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology, called OCT angiography (OCTA), capable of visualizing retina vasculature. However, due to its cost and limited view, OCTA technology is not widely used. Retinal fundus photography is a safe imaging technique used for capturing the overall structure of the retina. In order to visualize retinal vasculature without the need for FA and in a cost-effective, non-invasive, and accurate manner, we propose a deep learning conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of producing FA images from fundus photographs. The proposed GAN produces anatomically accurate angiograms, with similar fidelity to FA images, and significantly outperforms two other state-of-the-art generative algorithms ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]). Furthermore, evaluations by experts shows that our proposed model produces such high quality FA images that are indistinguishable from real angiograms. Our model as the first application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to medical image translation, by employing a theoretical framework capable of establishing a shared feature-space between two domains (i.e. funduscopy and fluorescein angiography) provides an unrivaled way for the translation of images from one domain to the other.", "Modern automation systems largely rely on closed loop control, wherein a controller interacts with a controlled process via actions, based on observations. These systems are increasingly complex, yet most deployed controllers are linear Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. PID controllers perform well on linear and near-linear systems but their simplicity is at odds with the robustness required to reliably control complex processes. Modern machine learning techniques offer a way to extend PID controllers beyond their linear control capabilities by using neural networks. However, such an extension comes at the cost of losing stability guarantees and controller interpretability. In this paper, we examine the utility of extending PID controllers with recurrent neural networks--namely, General Dynamic Neural Networks (GDNN); we show that GDNN (neural) PID controllers perform well on a range of complex control systems and highlight how they can be a scalable and interpretable option for modern control systems. To do so, we provide an extensive study using four benchmark systems that represent the most common control engineering benchmarks. All control environments are evaluated with and without noise as well as with and without disturbances. The neural PID controller performs better than standard PID control in 15 of 16 tasks and better than model-based control in 13 of 16 tasks. As a second contribution, we address the lack of interpretability that prevents neural networks from being used in real-world control processes. We use bounded-input bounded-output stability analysis to evaluate the parameters suggested by the neural network, making them understandable for engineers. This combination of rigorous evaluation paired with better interpretability is an important step towards the acceptance of neural-network-based control approaches for real-world systems. It is furthermore an important step towards interpretable and safely applied artificial intelligence.", "Positron emission tomography (PET), a functional and dynamic molecular imaging technique, is generally used to reveal tumors' biological behavior. Radiomics allows a high-throughput extraction of multiple features from images with artificial intelligence (AI) approaches and develops rapidly worldwide. Quantitative and objective features of medical images have been explored to recognize reliable biomarkers, with the development of PET radiomics. This paper will review the current clinical exploration of PET-based classical machine learning and deep learning methods, including disease diagnosis, the prediction of histological subtype, gene mutation status, tumor metastasis, tumor relapse, therapeutic side effects, therapeutic intervention and evaluation of prognosis. The applications of AI in oncology will be mainly discussed. The image-guided biopsy or surgery assisted by PET-based AI will be introduced as well. This paper aims to present the applications and methods of AI for PET imaging, which may offer important details for further clinical studies. Relevant precautions are put forward and future research directions are suggested.", "This paper focuses on key areas in which artificial intelligence has affected the chess world, including cheat detection methods, which are especially necessary recently, as there has been an unexpected rise in the popularity of online chess. Many major chess events that were to take place in 2020 have been canceled, but the global popularity of chess has in fact grown in recent months due to easier conversion of the game from offline to online formats compared with other games. Still, though a game of chess can be easily played online, there are some concerns about the increased chances of cheating. Artificial intelligence can address these concerns.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have the potential to improve multiple facets of medical practice, including diagnosis of disease, surgical training, clinical outcomes, and access to healthcare. There have been various applications of this technology to surgical fields. AI and ML have been used to evaluate a surgeon's technical skill. These technologies can detect instrument motion, recognize patterns in video recordings, and track the physical motion, eye movements, and cognitive function of the surgeon. These modalities also aid in the advancement of robotic surgical training. The da Vinci Standard Surgical System developed a recording and playback system to help trainees receive tactical feedback to acquire more precision when operating. ML has shown promise in recognizing and classifying complex patterns on diagnostic images and within pathologic tissue analysis. This allows for more accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment. Artificial neural networks are able to analyze sets of symptoms in conjunction with labs, imaging, and exam findings to determine the likelihood of a diagnosis or outcome. Telemedicine is another use of ML and AI that uses technology such as voice recognition to deliver health care remotely. Limitations include the need for large data sets to program computers to create the algorithms. There is also the potential for misclassification of data points that do not follow the typical patterns learned by the machine. As more applications of AI and ML are developed for the surgical field, further studies are needed to determine feasibility, efficacy, and cost.", "Artificial intelligence is gaining traction in automated medical imaging analysis. Development of more accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predictors of successful clinical outcomes is necessary to better define indications for surgery, improve clinical outcomes with targeted minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures, and realize cost savings by avoiding more invasive spine care.\nTo demonstrate the ability for deep learning neural network models to identify features in MRI DICOM datasets that represent varying intensities or severities of common spinal pathologies and injuries and to demonstrate the feasibility of generating automated verbal MRI reports comparable to those produced by reading radiologists.\nA 3-dimensional (3D) anatomical model of the lumbar spine was fitted to each of the patient's MRIs by a team of technicians. MRI T1, T2, sagittal, axial, and transverse reconstruction image series were used to train segmentation models by the intersection of the 3D model through these image sequences. Class definitions were extracted from the radiologist report for the central canal: (0) no disc bulge/protrusion/canal stenosis, (1) disc bulge without canal stenosis, (2) disc bulge resulting in canal stenosis, and (3) disc herniation/protrusion/extrusion resulting in canal stenosis. Both the left and right neural foramina were assessed with either (0) neural foraminal stenosis absent, or (1) neural foramina stenosis present. Reporting criteria for the pathologies at each disc level and, when available, the grading of severity were extracted, and a natural language processing model was used to generate a verbal and written report. These data were then used to train a set of very deep convolutional neural network models, optimizing for minimal binary cross-entropy for each classification.\nThe initial prediction validation of the implemented deep learning algorithm was done on 20% of the dataset, which was not used for artificial intelligence training. Of the 17,800 total disc locations for which MRI images and radiology reports were available, 14,720 were used to train the model, and 3560 were used to validate against. The convergence of validation accuracy achieved with the deep learning algorithm for the foraminal stenosis detector was 81% (sensitivity = 72.4.4%, specificity = 83.1%) after 25 complete iterations through the entire training dataset (epoch). The accuracy was 86.2% (sensitivity = 91.1%, specificity = 82.5%) for the central stenosis detector and 85.2% (sensitivity = 81.8%, specificity = 87.4%) for the disc herniation detector.\nDeep learning algorithms may be used for routine reporting in spine MRI. There was a minimal disparity among accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, indicating that the data were not overfitted to the training set. We concluded that variability in the training data tends to reduce overfitting and overtraining as the deep neural network models learn to focus on the common pathologies. Future studies should demonstrate the accuracy of deep neural network models and the predictive value of favorable clinical outcomes with intervention and surgery.\n3.\nFeasibility, clinical teaching, and evaluation study.", "Memristive devices share remarkable similarities to biological synapses, dendrites, and neurons at both the physical mechanism level and unit functionality level, making the memristive approach to neuromorphic computing a promising technology for future artificial intelligence. However, these similarities do not directly transfer to the success of efficient computation without device and algorithm co-designs and optimizations. Contemporary deep learning algorithms demand the memristive artificial synapses to ideally possess analog weighting and linear weight-update behavior, requiring substantial device-level and circuit-level optimization. Such co-design and optimization have been the main focus of memristive neuromorphic engineering, which often abandons the \"non-ideal\" behaviors of memristive devices, although many of them resemble what have been observed in biological components. Novel brain-inspired algorithms are being proposed to utilize such behaviors as unique features to further enhance the efficiency and intelligence of neuromorphic computing, which calls for collaborations among electrical engineers, computing scientists, and neuroscientists.", "Strong relations between medicine and public health have long been advocated. Today, professional medical practice assumes joint clinical/public health objectives: GPs are expected to practice community medicine; Hospital specialists can be involved in disease control and health service organisation; Doctors can teach, coach, evaluate, and coordinate care; Clinicians should interpret protocols with reference to clinical epidemiology. Public health physicians should tailor preventive medicine to individual health risks. This paper is targeted at those practitioners and academics responsible for their teams' professionalism and the accessibility of care, where the authors argue in favour of the epistemological integration of clinical medicine and public health.\nBased on empirical evidence the authors revisit the epistemological border of clinical and public health knowledge to support joint practice. From action-research and cognitive psychology, we derive clinical/public health knowledge categories that require different transmission and discovery techniques. The knowledge needed to support the universal human right to access professional care bridges both clinical and public health concepts, and summons professional ethics to validate medical decisions. To provide a rational framework for teaching and research, we propose the following categories: 'Know-how/practice techniques', corresponding a.o. to behavioural, communication, and manual skills; 'Procedural knowledge' to choose and apply procedures that meet explicit quality criteria; 'Practical knowledge' to design new procedures and inform the design of established procedures in new contexts; and Theoretical knowledge teaches the reasoning and theory of knowledge and the laws of existence and functioning of reality to validate clinical and public health procedures. Even though medical interventions benefit from science, they are, in essence, professional: science cannot standardise eco-biopsychosocial decisions; doctor-patient negotiations; emotional intelligence; manual and behavioural skills; and resolution of ethical conflicts.\nBecause the quality of care utilises the professionals' skill-base but is also affected by their intangible motivations, health systems should individually tailor continuing medical education and treat collective knowledge management as a priority. Teamwork and coaching by those with more experience provide such opportunities. In the future, physicians and health professionals could jointly develop clinical/public health integrated knowledge. To this end, governments should make provision to finance non-clinical activities.", "The green plum is rich in amino acids, lipids, inorganic salts, vitamins, and trace elements. It has high nutritional value and medicinal value and is very popular among Chinese people. However, green plums are susceptible to collisions and pests during growth, picking, storage, and transportation, causing surface defects, affecting the quality of green plums and their products and reducing their economic value. In China, defect detection and grading of green plum products are still performed manually. Traditional manual classification has low accuracy and high cost, which is far from meeting the production needs of green plum products. In order to improve the economic value of green plums and their products and improve the automation and intelligence level of the product production process, this study adopted deep learning methods based on a convolutional neural network and cost-effective computer vision technology to achieve efficient classification of green plum defects. First, a camera and LEDs were used to collect 1240 green plum images of RGB, and the green plum experimental classification standard was formulated and divided into five categories, namely, rot, spot, scar, crack, and normal. Images were randomly divided into a training set and test set, and the number of images of the training set was expanded. Then, the stochastic weight averaging (SWA) optimizer and w-softmax loss function were used to improve the VGG network, which was trained and tested to generate a green plum defect detection network model. The average recognition accuracy of green plum defects was 93.8%, the test time for each picture was 84.69 ms, the recognition rate of decay defect was 99.25%, and the recognition rate of normal green plum was 95.65%. The results were compared with the source VGG network, resnet18 network, and green lemon network. The results show that for the classification of green plum defects, the recognition accuracy of the green plum defect detection network increased by 9.8% and 16.6%, and the test speed is increased by 1.87 and 6.21 ms, respectively, which has certain advantages.", "This study investigates the potential of an artificial intelligence (AI) methodology, the radial basis function (RBF) artificial neural network (ANN), in the evaluation of thyroid lesions. Study Design. The study was performed on 447 patients who had both cytological and histological evaluation in agreement. Cytological specimens were prepared using liquid-based cytology, and the histological result was based on subsequent surgical samples. Each specimen was digitized; on these images, nuclear morphology features were measured by the use of an image analysis system. The extracted measurements (41,324 nuclei) were separated into two sets: the training set that was used to create the RBF ANN and the test set that was used to evaluate the RBF performance. The system aimed to predict the histological status as benign or malignant.\nThe RBF ANN obtained in the training set has sensitivity 82.5%, specificity 94.6%, and overall accuracy 90.3%, while in the test set, these indices were 81.4%, 90.0%, and 86.9%, respectively. Algorithm was used to classify patients on the basis of the RBF ANN, the overall sensitivity was 95.0%, the specificity was 95.5%, and no statistically significant difference was observed.\nAI techniques and especially ANNs, only in the recent years, have been studied extensively. The proposed approach is promising to avoid misdiagnoses and assists the everyday practice of the cytopathology. The major drawback in this approach is the automation of a procedure to accurately detect and measure cell nuclei from the digitized images.", "This opinion piece offers an insight on the origins of the debates around the question of whether and when we can reach artificial general intelligence in machine learning, and how science meets with spirituality when addressing this matter. It also offers an introduction to Obvious' new series of African masks: Facets of AGI.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is thought to play a significant role in professional and academic success. EI is important for medical personnel\u00a0to cope with highly stressful circumstances during clinical and academic settings. The present prospective follow-up study intends to evaluate the changes in EI and their correlates among medical undergraduates over a five-year period.\nData were collected in 2015 and 2020 at the Faculty of Medicine, University of\u00a0Colombo, Sri Lanka. EI was assessed using the validated 33-item self-assessment tool, Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT). In addition, socio-demographic details, students' involvement in extracurricular-activities during undergraduate life, students' satisfaction regarding the choice of studying medicine and plans to do postgraduate studies were also evaluated. A multiple-regression analysis was conducted among all students using percentage change in EI score as the continuous dependent variable, together with other independent variables (plan to do postgraduate studies, satisfaction in choice of medicine and extracurricular-activities).\nSample size was 170 (response rates-96.6%), with 41.2% males (n\u2009=\u200970). Mean EI scores at baseline among all students was 122.7\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6, and it had significantly increased at follow-up to 128.9\u2009\u00b1\u200911.2 (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001). This significant increase was independently observed in both males (122.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.2 vs. 130.0\u2009\u00b1\u200912.4, p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001) and females (123.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911.1 vs. 128.2\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3, p\u2009=\u20090.001). During follow-up, an increase in EI score was observed in students of all religions and ethnicities. Mean EI score also increased in all categories of monthly income, irrespective of the employment status or attainment of higher education of either parent. An increase in mean EI score during follow-up was observed in students irrespective of their engagement in or number of extracurricular-activities, they were involved. In the multiple regression analysis, being satisfied regarding their choice of the medical undergraduate programme (OR:11.75, p\u2009=\u20090.001) was the only significant factor associated with the percentage change in EI score.\nEI in this group significantly improved over 5-years of follow-up and was independent of gender, religion, ethnicity, socio-economic parameters and academic performance. Satisfaction in the chosen field was a significant predictor of the overall change in EI. Future studies are\u00a0\u00a0needed to identify and measure factors responsible for improvement in EI among medical undergraduates.", "Numerous studies show that the family plays a crucial role not only in the education of children but also in the acquisition of skills in the process of teaching and formal learning, especially in their reading competence. Furthermore, within the family, studies point to the basic role of the mother as the main axis of both educational and social teaching. The approach of this research aims to analyze whether maternal habits can influence the reading competence of their children. On the other hand, numerous studies point to the relationship between reading skills and emotional intelligence. Its inclusion in the equation of this construct can give information that will nuance the learning process in this evolutionary process. Thus, in this research, the objective is to establish the existence of a relationship between maternal reading habits with respect to reading competence and emotional intelligence in post-adolescents. Four-hundred-twenty first-year university students participated between the ages of 18 and 20 (43.8% men and 56.2% women) from the Andalusian universities of Granada, Malaga, and Jaen, all of them located in areas of medium socio-cultural context. Moderate mediation and factorial ANCOVA analyses have been carried out. The results point to the fact that the profile of the post-adolescents with the best score in reading competence also scores better in emotional intelligence and their mothers are those who score highest in reading habits. Thus, the role of the mother within the family is even more important than it appears in a society that seeks parity. New forms of work-family conciliation are necessary in order not to break the mother-child bond.", "Abundant clinical evidences indicate that the increased risk of cerebral palsy (CP) may be associated with the intrauterine exposure to maternal infection. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common cause of CP. However, little is known about the relationship between the intrauterine exposure of the fetus to CMV infection and CP. This study aims to explore the relationships between intrauterine CMV infection and clinical symptoms, classification, intelligence development and brain neuroimaging findings in children with CP.\nIn this study, 147 children with CP in recent 6\u00a0years were retrospectively analyzed (average age: 14.76\u2009\u00b1\u20093.07months; sex (M/F): 103/44). 148 children had CMV IgG and IgM positive sera identified by TORCH examination were selected as the control group (average age: 15.10\u2009\u00b1\u20093.21months; sex (M/F): 102/46), which also undergo the examination of CMV-DNA in urine. The age and sex of children in the control group were matched with those in the CP group. CMV-DNA in urine was detected by CMV fluorescence quantitative PCR, and t-test was performed to analyze the number of copies. For the CP group, standardized rehabilitation treatment was performed and the function of gross motor was evaluated by GMFM scale before and after treatment. The Gesell developmental scale (GDS) was used to assess the level of intellectual development. The classification of CP was conducted and the results of magnetic resonance imaging were analyzed. Finally, the correlations between the copy number of CMV-DNA and the clinical characteristics of children with CP were evaluated by the method of Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis.\nThe level of CMV infection was negatively correlated with the developmental quotient (DQ) of children with CP. Negative association was found between the level of CMV infection and the level of the gross motor development. The level of CMV infection was positively related with the occurrence probability of spastic quadriplegia. However, no associations were found between the abnormalities of brain tissue and the number of CMV copies. Moreover, CMV infection might add the difficulty of the rehabilitation treatment.\nCMV infection is a risk factor for the occurrence of CP in children. Pregnancy examination should be strengthened. Early detection and control of CMV infection may contribute to the rehabilitation of children with CP and reduce the disability and social burden.", "Pregnancy-related cancer management represents a real challenge for both the patients and the physicians. The long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of children in utero exposed to chemotherapeutic agents has only recently been addressed. This review aims to systematically integrate and highlight all existing data from the literature regarding the effect of prenatal exposure to chemotherapy on fetal brain growth and child development. All eligible studies are based on validated neurodevelopmental testing scales (e.g., Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence) and/or well-defined questionnaires. Our systematic review including 17 studies demonstrates that no major consequences on the neurodevelopment of children after in utero exposure to anti-cancer drugs have been reported; nevertheless, longer and more thorough follow-up with large-scale multicenter prospective studies is certainly required in order to draw firm conclusions.", "To evaluate the performance of a deep learning algorithm in the detection of referral-warranted diabetic retinopathy (RDR) on low-resolution fundus images acquired with a smartphone and indirect ophthalmoscope lens adapter.\nAn automated deep learning algorithm trained on 92,364 traditional fundus camera images was tested on a dataset of smartphone fundus images from 103 eyes acquired from two previously published studies. Images were extracted from live video screenshots from fundus examinations using a commercially available lens adapter and exported as a screenshot from live video clips filmed at 1080p resolution. Each image was graded twice by a board-certified ophthalmologist and compared to the output of the algorithm, which classified each image as having RDR (moderate nonproliferative DR or worse) or no RDR.\nIn spite of the presence of multiple artifacts (lens glare, lens particulates/smudging, user hands over the objective lens) and low-resolution images achieved by users of various levels of medical training, the algorithm achieved a 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83-0.95) area under the curve with an 89% sensitivity (95% CI 81%-100%) and 83% specificity (95% CI 77%-89%) for detecting RDR on mobile phone acquired fundus photos.\nThe fully data-driven artificial intelligence-based grading algorithm herein can be used to screen fundus photos taken from mobile devices and identify with high reliability which cases should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and treatment.\nThe implementation of this algorithm on a global basis could drastically reduce the rate of vision loss attributed to DR.", "This resource contains data from 112 Dutch adults (18-29 years of age) who completed the Individual Differences in Language Skills test battery that included 33 behavioural tests assessing language skills and domain-general cognitive skills likely involved in language tasks. The battery included tests measuring linguistic experience (e.g. vocabulary size, prescriptive grammar knowledge), general cognitive skills (e.g. working memory, non-verbal intelligence) and linguistic processing skills (word production/comprehension, sentence production/comprehension). Testing was done in a lab-based setting resulting in high quality data due to tight monitoring of the experimental protocol and to the use of software and hardware that were optimized for behavioural testing. Each participant completed the battery twice (i.e., two test days of four hours each). We provide the raw data from all tests on both days as well as pre-processed data that were used to calculate various reliability measures (including internal consistency and test-retest reliability). We encourage other researchers to use this resource for conducting exploratory and/or targeted analyses of individual differences in language and general cognitive skills.", "The primary treatment for malignant brain tumors is surgical resection. While gross total resection improves the prognosis, a supratotal resection may result in neurological deficits. On the other hand, accurate intraoperative identification of the tumor boundaries may be very difficult, resulting in subtotal resections. Histological examination of biopsies can be used repeatedly to help achieve gross total resection but this is not practically feasible due to the turn-around time of the tissue analysis. Therefore, intraoperative techniques to recognize tissue types are investigated to expedite the clinical workflow for tumor resection and improve outcome by aiding in the identification and removal of the malignant lesion. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with the power of extracting additional information from the imaged tissue. Because HSI images cannot be visually assessed by human observers, we instead exploit artificial intelligence techniques and leverage a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to investigate the potential of HSI in twelve in vivo specimens. The proposed framework consists of a 3D-2D hybrid CNN-based approach to create a joint extraction of spectral and spatial information from hyperspectral images. A comparison study was conducted exploiting a 2D CNN, a 1D DNN and two conventional classification methods (SVM, and the SVM classifier combined with the 3D-2D hybrid CNN) to validate the proposed network. An overall accuracy of 80% was found when tumor, healthy tissue and blood vessels were classified, clearly outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. These results can serve as a basis for brain tumor classification using HSI, and may open future avenues for image-guided neurosurgical applications.", "The international CIHLMU Occupational Safety and Health Symposium 2019 was held on 16th March, 2019 at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t Munich, Germany. About 60 participants from around the world representing occupational health and safety professionals, students, instructors from several institutions in Germany and abroad, attended the symposium.The main objective of the symposium was to create awareness on global challenges and opportunities in work-related respiratory diseases. One keynote lecture and six presentations were made. While the keynote lecture addressed issues on occupational diseases in the twenty-first century, the six presentations were centered on: Prevention and control of work-related respiratory diseases, considerations; Occupational health and safety in Mining: Respiratory diseases; The prevention of TB among health workers is our collective responsibility; Compensation and prevention of occupational diseases and discussion on how artificial intelligence can support them: Overview of international approaches; Work-related Asthma: Evidence from high-income countries; and The role of imaging in the diagnosis of work- related respiratory diseases. A panel discussion was conducted following the presentations on the importance and challenges of data acquisition which is needed to have a realistic picture of the occupational safety and health status of workers at different levels. The current summary is an attempt to share the proceedings of the symposium.", "Trait Emotional Intelligence (EI) has been associated with psychological outcomes in many conditions; however, it has received little attention in the field of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). We explored the relationship between trait EI, mood states, and future orientation in a sample of Italian women victims of IPV.\nWe recruited 409 help-seeking women who were victims of IPV. They completed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, Positive Affect-Negative Affect Schedule, Long-Term Personal Direction Scale, and Achievability of Future Goals Scale.\nThe results showed that trait EI was associated with the future orientation of IPV victims both directly and indirectly through the mood states.\nOur findings suggest potential paths for developing future psychoeducation methodologies designed at improving the quality of life of women IPV victims.", "Neurological disorders significantly outnumber diseases in other therapeutic areas. However, developing drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains the most challenging area in drug discovery, accompanied with the long timelines and high attrition rates. With the rapid growth of biomedical data enabled by advanced experimental technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as an indispensable tool to draw meaningful insights and improve decision making in drug discovery. Thanks to the advancements in AI and ML algorithms, now the AI/ML-driven solutions have an unprecedented potential to accelerate the process of CNS drug discovery with better success rate. In this review, we comprehensively summarize AI/ML-powered pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementations in the CNS area. After introducing the AI/ML models as well as the conceptualization and data preparation, we outline the applications of AI/ML technologies to several key procedures in drug discovery, including target identification, compound screening, hit/lead generation and optimization, drug response and synergy prediction, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. We review the current state-of-the-art of AI/ML-guided CNS drug discovery, focusing on blood-brain barrier permeability prediction and implementation into therapeutic discovery for neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss the major challenges and limitations of current approaches and possible future directions that may provide resolutions to these difficulties.", "Due to a pattern known as Marginalization-related Diminished Returns (MDRs), historically oppressed non-Hispanic Black Americans show weaker effects of economic status on health and development, when compared to socially privileged non-Hispanic White Americans. Such MDRs are also documented for the effects of economic status on the school performance of non-Hispanic Black children. However, the existing knowledge is minimal on similar diminished returns on children's intelligence.\nTo compare racial and ethnic groups for the effect of subjective economic status on children's cognitive performance, we compared non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black children for the effects of subjective economic status on children's matrix reasoning.\nThis cross-sectional study included 7898 children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. The predictor variable was subjective economic status, which was treated as a continuous measure. The primary outcome was children's matrix reasoning, a domain of cognitive performance, measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-IV (WISC-V) matrix reasoning total score.\nOverall, high subjective economic status was associated with higher matrix reasoning score. Race showed a statistically significant interaction with subjective economic status on children's matrix reasoning score. This interaction suggested that high subjective economic status has a smaller boosting effect on increasing matrix reasoning score for non-Hispanic Black children relative to non-Hispanic White children.\nThe degree by which subjective economic status correlates with matrix reasoning score, an important domain of cognitive performance, depends on race and racialization. Non-Hispanic Black children may show weaker gains in matrix reasoning from their subjective economic status than their non-Hispanic White counterparts. To minimize the racial gap in cognitive performance, we need to address diminished returns that occur as a result of the racialization of racial and ethnic minority children. Not only should we equalize economic status, but also increase the marginal returns of economic status for racial minorities, particularly non-Hispanic Black families. Such efforts require public policies that go beyond access and also consider how we can empower non-Hispanic Black communities and families so they can more effectively leverage and utilize their economic resources to secure measurable and tangible outcomes. Structural and societal barriers such as residential and school segregation may hinder non-Hispanic Black children from receiving the full effects of their family-level economic status on a variety of outcomes, including their cognitive performance.", "Revisiting professionalism, both as a medical ideal and educational topic, this paper asks whether, in the rise of artificial intelligence, healthcare commoditisation and environmental challenges, a rationale exists for merging clinical and public health practices. To optimize doctors' impact on community health, clinicians should introduce public health thinking and action into clinical practice, above and beyond controlling nosocomial infections and iatrogenesis. However, in the interest of effectiveness they should do everything possible to personalise care delivery. To solve this paradox, we explore why it is necessary for the boundaries between medicine and public health to be blurred.\nProceeding sequentially, we derive standards for medical professionalism from care quality criteria, neo-Hippocratic ethics, public health concepts, and policy outcomes. Thereby, we formulate benchmarks for health care management and apply them to policy evaluation. During this process we justify the social, professional - and by implication, non-commercial, non-industrial - mission of healthcare financing and policies. The complexity of ethical, person-centred, biopsychosocial practice requires a human interface between suffering, health risks and their therapeutic solution - and thus legitimises the medical profession's existence. Consequently, the universal human right to healthcare is a right to access professionally delivered care. Its enforcement requires significant updating of the existing medical culture, and not just in respect of the man/machine interface. This will allow physicians to focus on what artificial intelligence cannot do, or not do well. These duties should become the touchstone of their practice, knowledge and ethics. Artificial intelligence must support medical professionalism, not determine it. Because physicians need sufficient autonomy to exercise professional judgement, medical ethics will conflict with attempts to introduce clinical standardisation as a managerial paradigm, which is what happens when industrial-style management is applied to healthcare.\nPublic healthcare financing and policy ought to support medical professionalism, alongside integrated clinical and public health practice, and its management. Publicly-financed health management should actively promote ethics in publicly- oriented services. Commercialised healthcare is antithetical to ethical medical, and to clinical / public health practice integration. To lobby governments effectively, physicians need to appreciate the political economy of care.", "The digitalization of health and medicine and the growing availability of electronic health records (EHRs) has encouraged healthcare professionals and clinical researchers to adopt cutting-edge methodologies in the realms of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics to exploit existing large medical databases. In Hospital and Health System pharmacies, the application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to access and analyze the unstructured, free-text information captured in millions of EHRs (e.g., medication safety, patients' medication history, adverse drug reactions, interactions, medication errors, therapeutic outcomes, and pharmacokinetic consultations) may become an essential tool to improve patient care and perform real-time evaluations of the efficacy, safety, and comparative effectiveness of available drugs. This approach has an enormous potential to support share-risk agreements and guide decision-making in pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) Committees.", "In an age of information, visualizing and discerning meaning from data is as important as its collection. Interactive data visualization addresses both fronts by allowing researchers to explore data beyond what static images can offer. Here, we present Wiz, a web-based application for handling and visualizing large amounts of data. Wiz does not require programming or downloadable software for its use and allows scientists and non-scientists to unravel the complexity of data by splitting their relationships through 5D visual analytics, performing multivariate data analysis, such as principal component and linear discriminant analyses, all in vivid, publication-ready figures. With the explosion of high-throughput practices for materials discovery, information streaming capabilities, and the emphasis on industrial digitalization and artificial intelligence, we expect Wiz to serve as an invaluable tool to have a broad impact in our world of big data.", "Syndromic surveillance provides public health intelligence to aid in early warning and monitoring of public health impacts (e.g. seasonal influenza), or reassurance when an impact has not occurred. Using information collected during routine patient care, syndromic surveillance can be based on signs/symptoms/preliminary diagnoses. This approach makes syndromic surveillance much timelier than surveillance requiring laboratory confirmed diagnoses. The provision of healthcare services and patient access to them varies globally. However, emergency departments (EDs) exist worldwide, providing unscheduled urgent care to people in acute need. This provision of care makes ED syndromic surveillance (EDSyS) a potentially valuable tool for public health surveillance internationally. The objective of this study was to identify and describe the key characteristics of EDSyS systems that have been established and used globally.\nWe systematically reviewed studies published in peer review journals and presented at International Society of Infectious Disease Surveillance conferences (up to and including 2017) to identify EDSyS systems which have been created and used for public health purposes. Search criteria developed to identify \"emergency department\" and \"syndromic surveillance\" were applied to NICE healthcare, Global Health and Scopus databases.\nIn total, 559 studies were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review, comprising 136 journal articles and 423 conference abstracts/papers. From these studies we identified 115 EDSyS systems in 15 different countries/territories across North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia. Systems ranged from local surveillance based on a single ED, to comprehensive national systems. National EDSyS systems were identified in 8 countries/territories: 2 reported inclusion of \u226585% of ED visits nationally (France and Taiwan).\nEDSyS provides a valuable tool for the identification and monitoring of trends in severe illness. Technological advances, particularly in the emergency care patient record, have enabled the evolution of EDSyS over time. EDSyS reporting has become closer to 'real-time', with automated, secure electronic extraction and analysis possible on a daily, or more frequent basis. The dissemination of methods employed and evidence of successful application to public health practice should be encouraged to support learning from best practice, enabling future improvement, harmonisation and collaboration between systems in future.\nCRD42017069150 .", "General intelligence has been a topic of high interest for over a century. Traditionally, research on general intelligence was based on principal component analyses and other dimensionality reduction approaches. The advent of high-speed computing has provided alternative statistical tools that have been used to test predictions of human general intelligence. In comparison, research on general intelligence in non-human animals is in its infancy and still relies mostly on factor-analytical procedures. Here, we argue that dimensionality reduction, when incorrectly applied, can lead to spurious results and limit our understanding of ecological and evolutionary causes of variation in animal cognition. Using a meta-analytical approach, we show, based on 555 bivariate correlations, that the average correlation among cognitive abilities is low (r = 0.185; 95% CI: 0.087-0.287), suggesting relatively weak support for general intelligence in animals. We then use a case study with relatedness (genetic) data to demonstrate how analysing traits using mixed models, without dimensionality reduction, provides new insights into the structure of phenotypic variance among cognitive traits, and uncovers genetic associations that would be hidden otherwise. We hope this article will stimulate the use of alternative tools in the study of cognition and its evolution in animals.", "Artificial intelligence is one of the most popular topics in computer science. Convolutional neural network (CNN), which is an important artificial intelligence deep learning model, has been widely used in many fields. However, training a CNN requires a large amount of labeled data to achieve a good performance but labeling data is a time-consuming and laborious work. Since active learning can effectively reduce the labeling effort, we propose a new intelligent active learning method for deep learning, which is called multi-view active learning based on double-branch network (MALDB). Different from most existing active learning methods, our proposed MALDB first integrates two Bayesian convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) with different structures as two branches of a classifier to learn the effective features for each sample. Then, MALDB performs data analysis on unlabeled dataset and queries the useful unlabeled samples based on different characteristics of two branches to iteratively expand the training dataset and improve the performance of classifier. Finally, MALDB combines multiple level information from multiple hidden layers of BCNNs to further improve the stability of sample selection. The experiments are conducted on five extensively used datasets, Fashion-MNIST, Cifar-10, SVHN, Scene-15 and UIUC-Sports, the experimental results demonstrate the validity of our proposed MALDB.", "We aimed to determine whether artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted markerless motion capture software is useful in the clinical medicine and rehabilitation fields. Currently, it is unclear whether the AI-assisted markerless method can be applied to individuals with lower limb dysfunction, such as those using an ankle foot orthosis or a crutch. However, as many patients with lower limb paralysis and foot orthosis users lose metatarsophalangeal (MP) joint flexion during the stance phase, it is necessary to estimate the accuracy of foot recognition under fixed MP joint motion. The hip, knee, and ankle joint angles during treadmill walking were determined using OpenPose (a markerless method) and the conventional passive marker motion capture method; the results from both methods were compared. We also examined whether an ankle foot orthosis and a crutch could influence the recognition ability of OpenPose. The hip and knee joint data obtained by the passive marker method (MAC3D), OpenPose, and manual video analysis using Kinovea software showed significant correlation. Compared with the ankle joint data obtained by OpenPose and Kinovea, which were strongly correlated, those obtained by MAC3D presented a weaker correlation. OpenPose can be an adequate substitute for conventional passive marker motion capture for both normal gait and abnormal gait with an orthosis or a crutch. Furthermore, OpenPose is applicable to patients with impaired MP joint motion. The use of OpenPose can reduce the complexity and cost associated with conventional passive marker motion capture without compromising recognition accuracy.", "Recently, there has been increasing interest in techniques for enhancing working memory (WM), casting a new light on the classical picture of a rigid system. One reason is that WM performance has been associated with intelligence and reasoning, while its impairment showed correlations with cognitive deficits, hence the possibility of training it is highly appealing. However, results on WM changes following training are controversial, leaving it unclear whether it can really be potentiated. This study aims at assessing changes in WM performance by comparing it with and without training by a professional mnemonist. Two groups, experimental and control, participated in the study, organized in two phases. In the morning, both groups were familiarized with stimuli through an N-back task, and then attended a 2-hour lecture. For the experimental group, the lecture, given by the mnemonist, introduced memory encoding techniques; for the control group, it was a standard academic lecture about memory systems. In the afternoon, both groups were administered five tests, in which they had to remember the position of 16 items, when asked in random order. The results show much better performance in trained subjects, indicating the need to consider such possibility of enhancement, alongside general information-theoretic constraints, when theorizing about WM span.", "There has been a recent explosion of research into the field of artificial intelligence as applied to clinical radiology with the advent of highly accurate computer vision technology. These studies, however, vary significantly in design and quality. While recent guidelines have been established to advise on ethics, data management and the potential directions of future research, systematic reviews of the entire field are lacking. We aim to investigate the use of artificial intelligence as applied to radiology, to identify the clinical questions being asked, which methodological approaches are applied to these questions and trends in use over time.\nWe will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. We will perform a literature search through MEDLINE (Pubmed), and EMBASE, a detailed data extraction of trial characteristics and a narrative synthesis of the data. There will be no language restrictions. We will take a task-centred approach rather than focusing on modality or clinical subspecialty. Sub-group analysis will be performed by segmentation tasks, identification tasks, classification tasks, pegression/prediction tasks as well as a sub-analysis for paediatric patients.\nEthical approval will not be required for this study, as data will be obtained from publicly available clinical trials. We will disseminate our results in a peer-reviewed publication. Registration number PROSPERO: CRD42020154790.", "Recent studies suggest that deep learning systems can now achieve performance on par with medical experts in diagnosis of disease. A prime example is in the field of ophthalmology, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to detect retinal and ocular diseases. However, this type of artificial intelligence (AI) has yet to be adopted clinically due to questions regarding robustness of the algorithms to datasets collected at new clinical sites and a lack of explainability of AI-based predictions, especially relative to those of human expert counterparts. In this work, we develop CNN architectures that demonstrate robust detection of glaucoma in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and test with concept activation vectors (TCAVs) to infer what image concepts CNNs use to generate predictions. Furthermore, we compare TCAV results to eye fixations of clinicians, to identify common decision-making features used by both AI and human experts. We find that employing fine-tuned transfer learning and CNN ensemble learning create end-to-end deep learning models with superior robustness compared to previously reported hybrid deep-learning/machine-learning models, and TCAV/eye-fixation comparison suggests the importance of three OCT report sub-images that are consistent with areas of interest fixated upon by OCT experts to detect glaucoma. The pipeline described here for evaluating CNN robustness and validating interpretable image concepts used by CNNs with eye movements of experts has the potential to help standardize the acceptance of new AI tools for use in the clinic.", "Due to its specificity, fluorescence microscopy has become a quintessential imaging tool in cell biology. However, photobleaching, phototoxicity, and related artifacts continue to limit fluorescence microscopy's utility. Recently, it has been shown that artificial intelligence (AI) can transform one form of contrast into another. We present phase imaging with computational specificity (PICS), a combination of quantitative phase imaging and AI, which provides information about unlabeled live cells with high specificity. Our imaging system allows for automatic training, while inference is built into the acquisition software and runs in real-time. Applying the computed fluorescence maps back to the quantitative phase imaging (QPI) data, we measured the growth of both nuclei and cytoplasm independently, over many days, without loss of viability. Using a QPI method that suppresses multiple scattering, we measured the dry mass content of individual cell nuclei within spheroids. In its current implementation, PICS offers a versatile quantitative technique for continuous simultaneous monitoring of individual cellular components in biological applications where long-term label-free imaging is desirable.", "Stochastic separation theorems play important roles in high-dimensional data analysis and machine learning. It turns out that in high dimensional space, any point of a random set of points can be separated from other points by a hyperplane with high probability, even if the number of points is exponential in terms of dimensions. This and similar facts can be used for constructing correctors for artificial intelligent systems, for determining the intrinsic dimensionality of data and for explaining various natural intelligence phenomena. In this paper, we refine the estimations for the number of points and for the probability in stochastic separation theorems, thereby strengthening some results obtained earlier. We propose the boundaries for linear and Fisher separability, when the points are drawn randomly, independently and uniformly from a d-dimensional spherical layer and from the cube. These results allow us to better outline the applicability limits of the stochastic separation theorems in applications.", "In Tg-rasH2 carcinogenicity mouse models, a positive control group is treated with a carcinogen such as urethane or N-nitroso-N-methylurea to test study validity based on the presence of the expected proliferative lesions in the transgenic mice. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence-based deep learning (DL) could provide decision support for the toxicologic pathologist by screening for the proliferative changes, verifying the expected pattern for the positive control groups. Whole slide images (WSIs) of the lungs, thymus, and stomach from positive control groups were used for supervised training of a convolutional neural network (CNN). A single pathologist annotated WSIs of normal and abnormal tissue regions for training the CNN-based supervised classifier using INHAND criteria. The algorithm was evaluated using a subset of tissue regions that were not used for training and then additional tissues were evaluated blindly by 2 independent pathologists. A binary output (proliferative classes present or not) from the pathologists was compared to that of the CNN classifier. The CNN model grouped proliferative lesion positive and negative animals at high concordance with the pathologists. This process simulated a workflow for review of these studies, whereby a DL algorithm could provide decision support for the pathologists in a nonclinical study.", "Since early cybernetics studies by Wiener, Pask, and Ashby, the properties of living systems are subject to deep investigations. The goals of this endeavour are both understanding and building: abstract models and general principles are sought for describing organisms, their dynamics and their ability to produce adaptive behavior. This research has achieved prominent results in fields such as artificial intelligence and artificial life. For example, today we have robots capable of exploring hostile environments with high level of self-sufficiency, planning capabilities and able to learn. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between the emergence and evolution of life and artificial systems is still huge. In this paper, we identify the fundamental elements that characterize the evolution of the biosphere and open-ended evolution, and we illustrate their implications for the evolution of artificial systems. Subsequently, we discuss the most relevant issues and questions that this viewpoint poses both for biological and artificial systems.", "As a special case of machine learning, incremental learning can acquire useful knowledge from incoming data continuously while it does not need to access the original data. It is expected to have the ability of memorization and it is regarded as one of the ultimate goals of artificial intelligence technology. However, incremental learning remains a long term challenge. Modern deep neural network models achieve outstanding performance on stationary data distributions with batch training. This restriction leads to catastrophic forgetting for incremental learning scenarios since the distribution of incoming data is unknown and has a highly different probability from the old data. Therefore, a model must be both plastic to acquire new knowledge and stable to consolidate existing knowledge. This review aims to draw a systematic review of the state of the art of incremental learning methods. Published reports are selected from Web of Science, IEEEXplore, and DBLP databases up to May 2020. Each paper is reviewed according to the types: architectural strategy, regularization strategy and rehearsal and pseudo-rehearsal strategy. We compare and discuss different methods. Moreover, the development trend and research focus are given. It is concluded that incremental learning is still a hot research area and will be for a long period. More attention should be paid to the exploration of both biological systems and computational models.", "The review presents the basics of quantum decision theory, with an emphasis on temporary processes in decision making. The aim is to explain the principal points of the theory. How an operationally-testable, rational choice between alternatives differs from a choice decorated by irrational feelings is elucidated. Quantum-classical correspondence is emphasized. A model of quantum intelligence network is described. Dynamic inconsistencies are shown to be resolved in the frame of the quantum decision theory.", "The Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm was inspired by the social and biological behaviour of bird flocks searching for food sources. In this nature-based algorithm, individuals are referred to as particles and fly through the search space seeking for the global best position that minimises (or maximises) a given problem. Today, PSO is one of the most well-known and widely used swarm intelligence algorithms and metaheuristic techniques, because of its simplicity and ability to be used in a wide range of applications. However, in-depth studies of the algorithm have led to the detection and identification of a number of problems with it, especially convergence problems and performance issues. Consequently, a myriad of variants, enhancements and extensions to the original version of the algorithm, developed and introduced in the mid-1990s, have been proposed, especially in the last two decades. In this article, a systematic literature review about those variants and improvements is made, which also covers the hybridisation and parallelisation of the algorithm and its extensions to other classes of optimisation problems, taking into consideration the most important ones. These approaches and improvements are appropriately summarised, organised and presented, in order to allow and facilitate the identification of the most appropriate PSO variant for a particular application.", "Surfing in rough waters is not always as fun as wave riding the \"big one\". Similarly, in optimization problems, fitness landscapes with a huge number of local optima make the search for the global optimum a hard and generally annoying game. Computational Intelligence optimization metaheuristics use a set of individuals that \"surf\" across the fitness landscape, sharing and exploiting pieces of information about local fitness values in a joint effort to find out the global optimum. In this context, we designed surF, a novel surrogate modeling technique that leverages the discrete Fourier transform to generate a smoother, and possibly easier to explore, fitness landscape. The rationale behind this idea is that filtering out the high frequencies of the fitness function and keeping only its partial information (i.e., the low frequencies) can actually be beneficial in the optimization process. We prove our theory by combining surF with a settings free variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based on Fuzzy Logic, called Fuzzy Self-Tuning PSO. Specifically, we introduce a new algorithm, named F3ST-PSO, which performs a preliminary exploration on the surrogate model followed by a second optimization using the actual fitness function. We show that F3ST-PSO can lead to improved performances, notably using the same budget of fitness evaluations.", "High-dimensional data and high-dimensional representations of reality are inherent features of modern Artificial Intelligence systems and applications of machine learning. The well-known phenomenon of the \"curse of dimensionality\" states: many problems become exponentially difficult in high dimensions. Recently, the other side of the coin, the \"blessing of dimensionality\", has attracted much attention. It turns out that generic high-dimensional datasets exhibit fairly simple geometric properties. Thus, there is a fundamental tradeoff between complexity and simplicity in high dimensional spaces. Here we present a brief explanatory review of recent ideas, results and hypotheses about the blessing of dimensionality and related simplifying effects relevant to machine learning and neuroscience.", "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related death world-wide despite advances in treatment. This largely relates to the fact that many of these patients already have advanced diseases at the time of initial diagnosis. As most lung cancers present as nodules initially, an accurate classification of pulmonary nodules as early lung cancers is critical to reducing lung cancer morbidity and mortality. There have been significant recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for lung nodule evaluation. Deep learning (DL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in pulmonary nodule detection and have also excelled in segmentation and classification of pulmonary nodules. This review aims to provide an overview of progress that has been made in AI recently for pulmonary nodule detection and characterization with the ultimate goal of lung cancer prediction and classification while outlining some of the pitfalls and challenges that remain to bring such advancements to routine clinical use.", "This paper analyzes and compares the sensitivity and suitability of several artificial intelligence techniques applied to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system for the classification of stars. The MK system is based on a sequence of spectral prototypes that allows classifying stars according to their effective temperature and luminosity through the study of their optical stellar spectra. Here, we include the method description and the results achieved by the different intelligent models developed thus far in our ongoing stellar classification project: fuzzy knowledge-based systems, backpropagation, radial basis function (RBF) and Kohonen artificial neural networks. Since one of today's major challenges in this area of astrophysics is the exploitation of large terrestrial and space databases, we propose a final hybrid system that integrates the best intelligent techniques, automatically collects the most important spectral features, and determines the spectral type and luminosity level of the stars according to the MK standard system. This hybrid approach truly emulates the behavior of human experts in this area, resulting in higher success rates than any of the individual implemented techniques. In the final classification system, the most suitable methods are selected for each individual spectrum, which implies a remarkable contribution to the automatic classification process.", "Purpose The primary purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and the effectiveness of Starkey Livio Artificial Intelligence hearing aids in tracking step count. A secondary purpose was to investigate the accuracy of the fall detection and alert system of Livio hearing aids in detecting fall maneuvers. Method A participant wore Binaural Starkey Livio receiver-in-the-canal style hearing aids, a Sportline pedometer, and a Fitbit Charge 3 concurrently during both real-world and treadmill walking conditions. The real-world condition was conducted over a 5-day period. Step count for the treadmill protocol was assessed at six different treadmill speeds (2 mph, 2.5 mph, 3 mph, 3.5 mph, 4 mph, 4.5 mph, and 5 mph). The fall detection and alert system were assessed through falling maneuvers of activities of daily living. Results In the real-world condition, Livio, Sportline, and Fitbit recorded steps within 1 SD of each other. In addition, Livio recorded the most accurate steps compared to actual physical steps taken. In the treadmill condition, Livio recorded the least number of steps across all walking paces compared to the rest of the devices. Also, Livio hearing aids detected majority of the engaged falling maneuvers. Conclusions The Livio was found to be feasible, consistent, and sensitive in detecting steps and falls. Further research of higher sample size and recruitment of individuals with hearing loss are suggested.", "Cognitive reserve (CR) is known to reduce or even protect against the negative effects of aging on cognitive functioning. Nonetheless, little is known about how CR influences the relationship between different cognitive abilities and age in the old-old. The goal of the present study was, therefore, to test the hypothesis whether, in the old-old, CR still modifies the relationship between age and cognitive functioning. Eighty-three adults (aged 71-94) without mild cognitive impairment or dementia residing in residential care facilities completed a detailed neuropsychological test battery. CR was estimated using a combination of educational attainment and an estimation of verbal intelligence. Moderation analyses revealed a significant effect for fluency and a trend for flexibility, showing that the negative relationship between age and cognitive performance is reduced as the level of CR increases. These results demonstrate that CR still influences the relationship between age and executive functions in adults of advanced age.", "The treatment of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) requires frequent office visits to identify fluid in the retina that requires treatment. Frequent office-based examinations using optical coherence tomography (OCT) are a burden on patients and their care givers. The development of OCT systems that can be self-operated by patients at home offers the potential for precise remote monitoring and improved individualized therapy.\nAn investigational spectral domain OCT system (Notal Vision Home OCT, NVHO) for automatic patient-guided self-imaging intended for commercialization was evaluated in a total of 69 study participants with neovascular age-related macular degeneration with regard to image quality and usability. An artificial intelligence-based algorithm was used to identify, quantify and map intra- and subretinal fluids.\nSuccessful imaging with the NHVO was performed in all patients and in 93% of the enrolled eyes. The positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement for detection of fluid, intraretinal fluid, and subretinal fluid in at least one of three consecutive NHVO images was 97/95%, 96/94% and 100/98%, respectively, when compared to commercial in-office OCT systems. In 1.4% of the recorded eyes, fluid was only detected outside of the central 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u00b0 field of view but seen on a commercial OCT system with a larger field of view. The device operation for scanning their own eyes without assistance was rated by 95% of patients as easy. The analysis and depiction of fluid distribution and volume in a longitudinal case study illustrated the acute nature and anti-VEGF therapy response of nAMD.\nThe evaluated OCT system for home use meets the requirements for self-controlled imaging by nAMD patients with regard to image quality, field of view and usability. Image analysis based on artificial intelligence can potentially support clinicians in the assessment and utilization of large amounts of data generated by daily home OCT imaging.\nDie Behandlung von Patienten mit neovaskul\u00e4rer altersbedingter Makuladegeneration (nAMD) erfordert h\u00e4ufige Arztbesuche zur Erkennung therapiebed\u00fcrftiger Fl\u00fcssigkeit in der Netzhaut.

The work constructs a modified Artificial Neural Network (ANN) by incorporating a Discrete Hopfield Neural Network (DHNN) and Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA) with 3-Satisfiability (3-SAT) logic to initiate an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that executes optimization tasks for industrial data. The selection of 3-SAT logic is vital in data mining to represent entries of Amazon Employees Resources Access (AERA) via information theory. The proposed model employs CSA to improve the learning phase of DHNN by capitalizing features of CSA such as hypermutation and cloning process. This resulting the formation of the proposed model, as an alternative machine learning model to identify factors that should be prioritized in the approval of employees resources applications. Subsequently, reverse analysis method (SATRA) is integrated into our proposed model to extract the relationship of AERA entries based on logical representation. The study will be presented by implementing simulated, benchmark and AERA data sets with multiple performance evaluation metrics. Based on the findings, the proposed model outperformed the other existing methods in AERA data extraction.", "Credit scoring is an important tool used by financial institutions to correctly identify defaulters and non-defaulters. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are the Artificial Intelligence techniques that have been attracting interest due to their flexibility to account for various data patterns. Both are black-box models which are sensitive to hyperparameter settings. Feature selection can be performed on SVM to enable explanation with the reduced features, whereas feature importance computed by RF can be used for model explanation. The benefits of accuracy and interpretation allow for significant improvement in the area of credit risk and credit scoring. This paper proposes the use of Harmony Search (HS), to form a hybrid HS-SVM to perform feature selection and hyperparameter tuning simultaneously, and a hybrid HS-RF to tune the hyperparameters. A Modified HS (MHS) is also proposed with the main objective to achieve comparable results as the standard HS with a shorter computational time. MHS consists of four main modifications in the standard HS: (i) Elitism selection during memory consideration instead of random selection, (ii) dynamic exploration and exploitation operators in place of the original static operators, (iii) a self-adjusted bandwidth operator, and (iv) inclusion of additional termination criteria to reach faster convergence. Along with parallel computing, MHS effectively reduces the computational time of the proposed hybrid models. The proposed hybrid models are compared with standard statistical models across three different datasets commonly used in credit scoring studies. The computational results show that MHS-RF is most robust in terms of model performance, model explainability and computational time.", "It is estimated that missed opportunities for diagnosis occur in 1 in 20 primary care appointments. This is not only detrimental to individual patients, but also to the healthcare system as health outcomes are affected and healthcare expenditure inevitably increases. There are many potential solutions to limit the number of missed opportunities for diagnosis and management, one of which is through the use of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence and machine learning research and capabilities have exponentially grown in the past decades, with their applications in medicine showing great promise. As such, this review aims to discuss the possible uses of machine learning in primary care to maximise the quality of care provided.", "The role of next generation sequencing (NGS) for identifying high risk mutations in thyroid nodules following fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy continues to grow. However, ultrasound diagnosis even using the American College of Radiology's Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has limited ability to stratify genetic risk. The purpose of this study was to incorporate an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm of thyroid ultrasound with object detection within the TI-RADS scoring system to improve prediction of genetic risk in these nodules.\nTwo hundred fifty-two nodules from 249 patients that underwent ultrasound imaging and ultrasound-guided FNA with NGS with or without resection were retrospectively selected for this study. A machine learning program (Google AutoML) was employed for both automated nodule identification and risk stratification. Two hundred one nodules were used for model training and 51 reserved for testing. Three blinded radiologists scored the images of the test set nodules using TI-RADS and assigned each nodule as high or low risk based on the presence of highly suspicious imaging features on TI-RADS (very hypoechoic, taller-than-wide, extra-thyroidal extension, punctate echogenic foci). Subsequently, the TI-RADS classification was modified to incorporate AI for T4 nodules while treating T1-3 as low risk and T5 as high risk. All diagnostic predictions were compared to the presence of a high-risk mutation and pathology when available.\nThe AI algorithm correctly located all nodules in the test dataset (100% object detection). The model predicted the malignancy risk with a sensitivity of 73.9%, specificity of 70.8%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 70.8%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 73.9% and accuracy of 72.4% during the testing. The radiologists performed with a sensitivity of 52.1 \u00b1 4.4%, specificity of 65.2 \u00b1 6.4%, PPV of 59.1 \u00b1 3.5%, NPV of 58.7 \u00b1 1.8%, and accuracy of 58.8 \u00b1 2.5% when using TI-RADS and sensitivity of 53.6 \u00b1 17.6% (p=0.87), specificity of 83.3 \u00b1 7.2% (p=0.06), PPV of 75.7 \u00b1 8.5% (p=0.13), NPV of 66.0 \u00b1 8.8% (p=0.31), and accuracy of 68.7 \u00b1 7.4% (p=0.21) when using AI-modified TI-RADS.\nIncorporation of AI into TI-RADS improved radiologist performance and showed better malignancy risk prediction than AI alone when classifying thyroid nodules. Employing AI in existing thyroid nodule classification systems may help more accurately identifying high-risk nodules.", "Approximately one third of psychosis patients fail to respond to conventional antipsychotic medication, which exerts its effect via striatal dopamine receptor antagonism. The present study aimed to investigate impaired cognitive control as a potential contributor to persistent positive symptoms in treatment resistant (TR) patients. 52 medicated First Episode Psychosis (FEP) patients (17 TR and 35 non-TR (NTR)) took part in a longitudinal study in which they performed a series of cognitive tasks and a clinical assessment at two timepoints, 12 months apart. Cognitive performance at baseline was compared to that of 39 healthy controls (HC). Across both timepoints, TR patients were significantly more impaired than NTR patients in a task of cognitive control, while performance on tasks of phonological and semantic fluency, working memory and general intelligence did not differ between patient groups. No significant associations were found between cognitive performance and psychotic symptomatology, and no significant performance changes were observed from the first to second timepoint in any of the cognitive tasks within patient groups. The results suggest that compared with NTR patients, TR patients have an exacerbated deficit specific to cognitive control, which is established early in psychotic illness and stabilises in the years following a first episode.", "Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a complex disease resulting from the interplay of myriad biological and environmental processes that lead to remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature with consequent pulmonary hypertension. Despite currently available therapies, there remains significant morbidity and mortality in this disease. There is great interest in identifying and applying biomarkers to help diagnose patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, inform prognosis, guide therapy, and serve as surrogate endpoints. An extensive literature on potential biomarker candidates is available, but barriers to the implementation of biomarkers for clinical use in pulmonary arterial hypertension are substantial. Various omic strategies have been undertaken to identify key pathways regulated in pulmonary arterial hypertension that could serve as biomarkers including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic approaches. Other biologically relevant components such as circulating cells, microRNAs, exosomes, and cell-free DNA have recently been gaining attention. Because of the size of the datasets generated by these omic approaches and their complexity, artificial intelligence methods are being increasingly applied to decipher their meaning. There is growing interest in imaging the lung with various modalities to understand and visualize processes in the lung that lead to pulmonary vascular remodeling including high resolution computed tomography, Xenon magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. Such imaging modalities have the potential to demonstrate disease modification resulting from therapeutic interventions. Because right ventricular function is a major determinant of prognosis, imaging of the right ventricle with echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role in the evaluation of patients and may also be useful in clinical studies of pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "In a collaborative effort between the Commercialization Committee of the International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy (ISCT) and Bloomberg Intelligence, a broad survey of the investment community was executed in order to understand investor perceptions of companies that develop cell and gene therapies (CGTs) and gauge the trajectory of future investment. A broad spectrum of investors responded to the survey, including both health care specialists and generalist investors across a wide range of fund sizes and geographies. A majority of survey respondents have limited exposure to CGTs in their health care portfolios today, which highlights the opportunity to increase awareness of this burgeoning field in the investment community. The survey established that clinically significant data are the most important consideration when making an investment in this area, whereas safety concerns were highlighted as the most prominent barrier to making an investment. Challenges with manufacturing and scale-up were also ranked as a significant concern. The majority of investors hold the belief that both autologous and allogeneic cell therapies can co-exist. The detailed findings of this survey will help to provide a foundation for educational content that the ISCT Commercialization Committee can bring forth to further the investment in CGTs through the newly created Investigators to Investors program.", "To digitalize restorative dentistry means to digitalize all the approaches involved in the clinical diagnosis and treatment process, in the production of individualized restorations, in the information transmission and communication between dentists and patients respectively between dentists and technicians, and even in the personalized understanding of esthetics. This is a cross-disciplinary issue that interconnects a wide range of topics. The way of understanding the digital tendency and of integrating the-already-digitalized steps into a system have a strategic impact on the development of the dental industry. By following the trace of the development of digital procedures in restorative dentistry, in this paper, we intend to classify the digitalization into two categories as the special and general ones, and will point out the limitations in understanding the digitalization in prosthodontics merely from the perspective of diagnosis or the production of individualized restorations. The role of digitalization in leading the conceptual development and the new possibilities opened up by the integrated digital technologies will be emphasized. Digitalization has changed the way of interaction between dentists and technicians. It is beneficial to the reorganization of medical and technological resources. Its potential in upgrading the dental industry deserves attention. Digitalization promotes the establishment of a collaborative and sharing ecosystem in restorative dentistry, which would pave the way towards artificial intelligence.\n\u53e3\u8154\u4fee\u590d\u6d89\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u7597\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4fee\u590d\u4f53\u5b9a\u5236\u3001\u533b\u60a3\u548c\u533b\u6280\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4e0e\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5bf9\u7f8e\u5b66\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u3002\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u4fee\u590d\u4ee5\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u4e3a\u7275\u5f15\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u5728\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u4eba\u624d\u4e0e\u7269\u8d28\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u533b\u6280\u5de5\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6539\u5584\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u76ca\u3002\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u6218\u7565\u5e03\u5c40\u5bf9\u53e3\u8154\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u53e3\u8154\u4fee\u590d\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u72ed\u4e49\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u4e24\u5927\u53d1\u5c55\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7247\u9762\u6027\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u7406\u5ff5\u7684\u6218\u7565\u5148\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u62d3\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u6280\u672f\u52a9\u529b\u533b\u60a3\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u533b\u5e08\u4e0e\u6280\u5e08\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u533b\u6280\u8d44\u6e90\u91cd\u6574\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u53e3\u8154\u4ea7\u4e1a\u5347\u7ea7\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u503c\u5f97\u91cd\u89c6\u3002\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u53e3\u8154\u4fee\u590d\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u53e3\u8154\u4fee\u590d\u884c\u4e1a\u534f\u540c\u5171\u4eab\u751f\u6001\u7684\u5efa\u7acb\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u901a\u5411\u53e3\u8154\u533b\u7597\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7684\u5fc5\u7ecf\u4e4b\u8def\u3002.", "The impact of assistive technology use on the lives of people with disabilities has long been demonstrated in the literature. Despite the need for assistive technologies, and a wealth of innovative, afford-able, and accessible products, a low rate of assistive technology uptake is globally maintained. One of the reasons for this gap is related to data and knowledge formation and management. Low access to information and a lack of assessment services is evident. Fragmentation of data, inconsistency in assessment methodology and heterogeneity in the competence of assistive technology professionals, has led to a growing interest in the opportunities that data sciences, including AI, hold for the future of the assistive technology sector, as a supportive and constructive mechanism in any decision-making process.\nIn this short paper, we seek to describe some of the principles that such an AI-based recommendation system should be built upon, using the Atvisor platform as a case study. Atvisor.ai is an AI-based digital platform that supports assistive technology assessments and the decision-making process.\nOur recommendations represent the aggregated insights from two pilots held in Israel, testing the platform in multiple environments and with different stakeholders. These recommendations include ensuring the continuum of care and providing a full user journey, incorporating shared decision making and self-assessment features, providing data personalisation and a holistic approach, building a market network infrastructure and designing the tool within a wider service delivery model design. Assessment and decision-making processes, crucial to optimal uptake, cab be leveraged by technology to become more accessible and personalised.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONProvides principles for the development of an AI-based recommendation system for assistive technology decision making.Promotes the use of artificial intelligence to support users and professionals in the assistive technology decision making process.Personalization of data regarding assistive technology, according to functional, holistic and client centered profiles of users, ensures optimal match and better use of assistive technology.Self-assessment and professional assessment components are important for enabling multiple access points to the assistive technology decision making process, based on the preferences and needs of users.", "In recent years, microfluidic technologies have emerged as a powerful approach for the advanced synthesis and rapid optimization of various solution-processed nanomaterials, including semiconductor quantum dots and nanoplatelets, and metal plasmonic and reticular framework nanoparticles. These fluidic systems offer access to previously unattainable measurements and synthesis conditions at unparalleled efficiencies and sampling rates. Despite these advantages, microfluidic systems have yet to be extensively adopted by the colloidal nanomaterial community. To help bridge the gap, this progress report details the basic principles of microfluidic reactor design and performance, as well as the current state of online diagnostics and autonomous robotic experimentation strategies, toward the size, shape, and composition-controlled synthesis of various colloidal nanomaterials. By discussing the application of fluidic platforms in recent high-priority colloidal nanomaterial studies and their potential for integration with rapidly emerging artificial intelligence-based decision-making strategies, this report seeks to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations between microfluidic reactor engineers and colloidal nanomaterial chemists. Full convergence of these two research efforts offers significantly expedited and enhanced nanomaterial discovery, optimization, and manufacturing.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have attracted considerable ethical attention for good reasons. Although AI models might advance human welfare in unprecedented ways, progress will not occur without substantial risks. This article considers 3 such risks: system malfunctions, privacy protections, and consent to data repurposing. To meet these challenges, traditional risk managers will likely need to collaborate intensively with computer scientists, bioinformaticists, information technologists, and data privacy and security experts. This essay will speculate on the degree to which these AI risks might be embraced or dismissed by risk management. In any event, it seems that integration of AI models into health care operations will almost certainly introduce, if not new forms of risk, then a dramatically heightened magnitude of risk that will have to be managed.", "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is part of the diagnostic work-up for cardiac amyloidosis (CA). Deep learning (DL) is an application of artificial intelligence that may allow to automatically analyze CMR findings and establish the likelihood of CA.\n1.5\u00a0T CMR was performed in 206 subjects with suspected CA (n\u2009=\u2009100, 49% with unexplained left ventricular\u00a0(LV) hypertrophy; n\u2009=\u2009106, 51% with blood dyscrasia and suspected light-chain amyloidosis).

The current study evaluates 3D imaging efficacy to assess conjugate gaze deviation and correlate direction and strength of deviation to neuro-clinical findings.A retrospective analysis of 519 patients who had CT scans for suspected AIS at our institution. Direction and angle of eye deviation were calculated based on 2D axial images. Volumetric reconstruction of CT scans allowed for calculation of 3D conjugate gaze adjusted length (CGAL). Angle, direction, and vector strength of both 2D and 3D scans were calculated by an artificial intelligence algorithm and tested for agreement with hemispheric ischemia location. CGAL measurements were correlated to NIHSS scores. Follow up MRI data was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of CGAL in the identification of AIS.The final analysis included 122 patients. A strong agreement was found between 3D gaze direction and hemispheric ischemia location. CGAL measurements were highly correlated with NIHSS score (r\u200a=\u200a.72, P\u200a=\u200a.01). A CGAL >0.25, >0.28, and >0.35 exhibited a sensitivity of 91%, 86%, and 82% and specificity of 66%, 89%, and 89%, respectively, in AIS identification. A CGAL >0.28 has the best sensitivity-specificity balance in the identification of AIS. A CGAL >0.25 has the highest sensitivity.Given CED's correlation with NIHSS score a 1/4 deviation in the ipsilateral direction is a sensitive ancillary radiographic sign to assist radiologists in making a correct diagnosis even when not presented with full clinical data.", "Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is a Swarm Intelligence optimization algorithm well known for its versatility. The selection of decision variables to update is purely stochastic, incurring several issues to the local search capability of the ABC. To address these issues, a self-adaptive decision variable selection mechanism is proposed with the goal of balancing the degree of exploration and exploitation throughout the execution of the algorithm. This selection, named Adaptive Decision Variable Matrix (A-DVM), represents both stochastic and deterministic parameter selection in a binary matrix and regulates the extent of how much each selection is employed based on the estimation of the sparsity of the solutions in the search space. The influence of the proposed approach to performance and robustness of the original algorithm is validated by experimenting on 15 highly multimodal benchmark optimization problems. Numerical comparison on those problems is made against the ABC and their variants and prominent population-based algorithms (e.g., Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution). Results show an improvement in the performance of the algorithms with the A-DVM in the most challenging instances.", "The sources of reading comprehension difficulties in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are still open to discussion.

A group of participants with ASD, and intelligence-, receptive oral language- and reading skills-matched control peers, read three stories under three different reading goals conditions: read for entertainment; read for study; and read fast and search information for a previously presented question. Each text required participants to answer comprehension questions. The ASD group was less accurate in question answering. The control group was faster in reading questions, displayed more fixations on the text, and reported to be more confident in question answering during reading for study compared to reading for entertainment. These differences between reading goals were not observed in the ASD group. The control group adopted and was aware of using different reading strategies according to different reading goals. In contrast, the ASD group did not change their reading behavior and strategies between entertainment and study reading goal condition, showing less of a tendency to adopt deep-level processing strategies when necessary. Planning, as measured by Tower of Hanoi, was the only executive task that predicted individual differences in text reading time across conditions. Participants with better planning ability were also able to adapt their reading behavior to different reading instructions. Difficulties in adjusting the reading behavior according to the task, evaluating own performance and planning may be partly involved in reading comprehension problems in ASD. LAY ABSTRACT: The control group read questions faster, reported to be more confident in question answering during reading for study compared to reading for entertainment, and were aware of using different reading strategies according to different reading goals. In contrast, the autistic group did not change their reading behavior and strategies according to the reading goal. Difficulties in adjusting the reading behavior according to the task, in evaluating own performance and in planning may be partly involved in reading comprehension problems in autism.

These are waves of huge social energy. Often they are of destructive character, a kind of information tsunami. However, they can also carry positive improvements in human society, as waves of decision-making matching rational recommendations of societal institutes. The main distinguishing features of these waves are their high amplitude, coherence (homogeneous character of social actions generated by them), and short time needed for their generation and relaxation. Such waves can be treated as large-scale exhibitions of the bandwagon effect. We show that this socio-psychic phenomenon can be modeled based on the recently developed social laser theory. This theory can be used to model stimulated amplification of coherent social actions. \"Actions\" are treated very generally, from mass protests to votes and other collective decisions, such as, e.g., acceptance (often unconscious) of some societal recommendations. In this paper, we concentrate on the theory of laser resonators, physical vs. social. For the latter, we analyze in detail the functioning of Internet-based echo chambers. Their main purpose is increasing of the power of the quantum information field as well as its coherence. Of course, the bandwagon effect is well known and well studied in social psychology. However, social laser theory gives the possibility to model it by using general formalism of quantum field theory. The paper contains the minimum of mathematics and it can be read by researchers working in psychological, cognitive, social, and political sciences; it might also be interesting for experts in information theory and artificial intelligence.", "Impairment in social interaction is a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the factors which contribute to this social skill deficiency are poorly understood. Previous research has shown that cognitive ability can impact social skill development in ASD. Yet, children with ASD whose cognitive abilities are in the normal range nevertheless demonstrate deficits in social skill. More recently, the social motivation theory of ASD has emerged as a framework by which to understand how failure to seek social experiences may lead to social skill deficits. This study was designed to better understand the relationships between cognitive ability, social motivation, and social skill in a well-characterized cohort of children with ASD (n = 79), their unaffected siblings (n = 50), and unrelated neurotypical controls (n = 60). The following instruments were used: The Stanford-Binet intelligence quotient (IQ), the Social Responsiveness Scale's Social Motivation Subscale, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales' Socialization Standard Score. We found that lower cognitive ability contributed to diminished social skill, but did so universally in all children. In contrast, social motivation strongly predicted social skill only in children with ASD, such that those with the lowest social motivation exhibited the greatest social skill impairment. Notably, this relationship was observed across a large range of intellectual ability but was most pronounced in those with IQs\u2009\u2265\u200980. These findings establish a unique link between social motivation and social skill in ASD and support the hypothesis that low social motivation may impair social skill acquisition in this disorder, particularly in children without intellectual disability. LAY SUMMARY: The relationships between cognitive ability, social motivation, and social skill are poorly understood. Here we report that cognitive ability predicts social skill in all children, whereas social motivation predicts social skill only in children with autism. These results establish a unique link between social motivation and social skill in autism, and suggest that low social motivation may impair social skill acquisition in this disorder, particularly in those without intellectual disability.", "The aim of this study was to investigate which factors predict lifetime reports of delinquent behavior in young adults who had received adaptive multimodal treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) starting at ages 6-10\u00a0years. Participants were reassessed 13-24\u00a0years (M\u2009=\u200917.6, SD\u2009=\u20091.8) after they had received individualized ADHD treatment in the Cologne Adaptive Multimodal Treatment Study (CAMT). Their behavior was classified as non-delinquent (n\u2009=\u200934) or delinquent (n\u2009=\u200925) based on self-reports regarding the number of police contacts, offenses, and convictions at follow-up. Childhood variables assessed at post-intervention (e.g., externalizing child behavior problems, intelligence, and parenting behavior) that were significantly associated with group membership were entered as possible predictors of delinquency in a Chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID) analysis. Delinquent behavior during adolescence and adulthood was best predicted by (a) meeting the symptom count diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder (CD) according to parent ratings, in combination with a nonverbal intelligence of IQ\u2009\u2264\u2009106 at post-intervention, and (b) delinquent behavior problems (teacher rating) at post-intervention. The predictor variables specified in the CHAID analysis classified 81% of the participants correctly. The results support the hypothesis that a childhood diagnosis of ADHD is only predictive of delinquent behavior if it is accompanied by early conduct behavior problems. Low nonverbal intelligence was found to be an additional risk factor. These findings underline the importance of providing behavioral interventions that focus on externalizing behavior problems to children with ADHD and comorbid conduct problems.", "The indispensability of visual working memory (VWM) in human daily life suggests its importance in higher cognitive functions and neurological diseases. However, despite the extensive research efforts, most findings on the neural basis of VWM are limited to a unimodal context (either structure or function) and have low generalization. To address the above issues, this study proposed the usage of multimodal neuroimaging in combination with machine learning to reveal the neural mechanism of VWM across a large cohort (N =\u2009547). Specifically, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging features extracted from voxel-wise amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, gray matter volume, and fractional anisotropy were used to build an individual VWM capacity prediction model through a machine learning pipeline, including the steps of feature selection, relevance vector regression, cross-validation, and model fusion. The resulting model exhibited promising predictive performance on VWM (r =\u2009.402, p <\u2009.001), and identified features within the subcortical-cerebellum network, default mode network, motor network, corpus callosum, anterior corona radiata, and external capsule as significant predictors. The main results were then compared with those obtained on emotional regulation and fluid intelligence using the same pipeline, confirming the specificity of our findings. Moreover, the main results maintained well under different cross-validation regimes and preprocess strategies. These findings, while providing richer evidence for the importance of multimodality in understanding cognitive functions, offer a solid and general foundation for comprehensively understanding the VWM process from the top down.", "Researchers have found many similarities between the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and SARS-CoV-19 through existing data that reveal the SARS's cause. Artificial intelligence (AI) learning models can be created to predict drug structures that can be used to treat COVID-19. Despite the effectively demonstrated repurposed drugs, more repurposed drugs should be recognized. Furthermore, technological advancements have been helpful in the battle against COVID-19. Machine intelligence technology can support this procedure by rapidly determining adequate and effective drugs against COVID-19 and by overcoming any barrier between a large number of repurposed drugs, laboratory/clinical testing, and final drug authorization. This paper reviews the proposed vaccines and medicines for SARS-CoV-2 and the current application of AI in drug repurposing for COVID-19 treatment.", "To compare the predictive validity of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (BSID-II) and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III) for cognitive function at early school age in very preterm infants.\nSeventy-seven former preterm infants (born <32\u2009weeks gestation and \u22642000\u2009g) completed both the BSID-II and the Bayley-III at 2\u2009years corrected age. Children enrolled at hospitals that perform follow-up beyond 2\u2009years had cognitive assessments with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV). Associations between Bayley and WPPSI scores were assessed using correlation coefficients, linear regression, and Bland-Altman plots.\nThirty-one of 45 eligible children were tested with the WPPSI-IV at 47 \u00b1 11\u2009months. Average BSID-II Mental Development Index (MDI) was 86 \u00b1 19, Bayley-III Cognitive composite score was 101 \u00b1 12 and WPPSI Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) was 96 \u00b1 12. Correlation between MDI and FSIQ was 0.54 (P\u2009<\u2009.001); correlation between Bayley-III cognitive composite score and FSIQ was 0.31 (P\u2009=\u2009.03). Bayley-III language composite had a modestly stronger correlation with FSIQ than cognitive composite (correlation coefficient 0.39; P\u2009=\u2009.005). Linear regression models also demonstrated that BSID-II was more closely correlated with FSIQ than Bayley-III. This bias was consistent across the full range of scores.\nThe BSID-II underestimated FSIQ and the Bayley-III overestimated FSIQ. Children at risk for impairment might be missed with the Bayley-III. As the Bayley-4 is introduced, clinicians and researchers should be cautious about interpretation of scores until performance of this new measure is fully understood.", "Diagnosis of COVID-19 has been challenging owing to the need for mass testing and for combining distinct types of detection to cover the different stages of the infection. In this review, we have surveyed the most used methodologies for diagnosis of COVID-19, which can be basically categorized into genetic-material detection and immunoassays. Detection of genetic material with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and similar techniques has been achieved with high accuracy, but these methods are expensive and require time-consuming protocols which are not widely available, especially in less developed countries. Immunoassays for detecting a few antibodies, on the other hand, have been used for rapid, less expensive tests, but their accuracy in diagnosing infected individuals has been limited. We have therefore discussed the strengths and limitations of all of these methodologies, particularly in light of the required combination of tests owing to the long incubation periods. We identified the bottlenecks that prevented mass testing in many countries, and proposed strategies for further action, which are mostly associated with materials science and chemistry. Of special relevance are the methodologies which can be integrated into point-of-care (POC) devices and the use of artificial intelligence that do not require products from a well-developed biotech industry.", "Given the importance of the period of life from 10 to 30 years in terms of cognitive development and education, combined with the high incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) during this period, and limited consensus as to the pattern and degree of cognitive impairment post TBI during this period, we conducted a systematic review to investigate cognitive performance across a range of domains among individuals between the ages of 10 and 30 years who had sustained a TBI. We searched five databases and identified 799 unique records; 52 met our inclusion criteria. These studies reported cognitive function for intelligence, attention, memory, processing speed, and executive function. The majority of the studies reported significant effects, suggesting that TBI is associated with cognitive impairments in these domains. Nine of the studies used physiological tests (EEG and fMRI), the outcomes of which supported behaviorally demonstrated cognitive deficits. In the studies we reviewed, individuals aged 10-30 years who had experienced a TBI performed worse than healthy controls on cognitive function measures-specifically for attention, memory, processing speed, and executive function. In the studies that subjected the individuals with TBI to EEG and fMRI, atypical activation in associated brain regions was demonstrated while the individuals were undergoing cognitive tasks. However, caution should be taken when interpreting the overall results due to the high risk of bias across the majority of the studies. The broader implications of reduced cognitive performance after TBI across this age range are yet to be fully understood.", "Endoscopic diagnosis of early esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) is complicated and dependent on operators' experience. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model for automatic diagnosis of early ESCC.\nNon-magnifying and magnifying endoscopic images of normal/noncancerous lesions, early ESCC, and advanced esophageal cancer (AEC) were retrospectively obtained from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. A total of 10,988 images from 5075 cases were chosen for training and validation. Another 2309 images from 1055 cases were collected for testing. One hundred and four real-time videos were also collected to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the AI model. The diagnostic performance of the AI model was compared with endoscopists by magnifying images and the assistant efficiency of the AI model for novices was evaluated.\nThe AI diagnosis for non-magnifying images showed a per-patient accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.5%, 100%, 99.5% for white light imaging, and 97.0%, 97.2%, 96.4% for optical enhancement/iodine straining images. Regarding diagnosis for magnifying images, the per-patient accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 88.1%, 90.9%, and 85.0%. The diagnostic accuracy of the AI model was similar to experts (84.5%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.205) and superior to novices (68.5%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). The diagnostic performance of novices was significantly improved by AI assistance. When it comes to the diagnosis for real-time videos, the AI model showed acceptable performance as well.\nThe AI model could accurately recognize early ESCC among noncancerous mucosa and AEC. It could be a potential assistant for endoscopists, especially for novices.", "There is a persistent need for mental ill-health prevention and intervention among at-risk and vulnerable subpopulations. Major disruptions to life, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, present an opportunity for a better understanding of the experience of stressors and vulnerability. Faster and better ways of psychological screening and tracking are more generally required in response to the increased demand upon mental health care services. The argument that mental and physical health should be considered together as part of a biopsychosocial approach is garnering acceptance in elite athlete literature. However, the sporting population are unique in that there is an existing stigma of mental health, an underrecognition of mental ill-health, and engagement difficulties that have hindered research, prevention, and intervention efforts.\nThe aims of this paper are to summarize and evaluate the literature on athletes' increased vulnerability to mental ill-health and digital mental health solutions as a complement to prevention and intervention, and to show relationships between athlete mental health problems and resilience as well as digital mental health screening and tracking, and faster and better treatment algorithms.\nThis mini review shapes literature in the fields of athlete mental health and digital mental health by summarizing and evaluating journal and review articles drawn from PubMed Central and the Directory of Open Access Journals.\nConsensus statements and systematic reviews indicated that elite athletes have comparable rates of mental ill-health prevalence to the general population. However, peculiar subgroups require disentangling. Innovative expansion of data collection and analytics is required to respond to engagement issues and advance research and treatment programs in the process. Digital platforms, machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence are useful for mental health screening and tracking in various subpopulations. It is necessary to determine appropriate conditions for algorithms for use in recommendations. Partnered with real-time automation and machine learning models, valid and reliable behavior sensing, digital mental health screening, and tracking tools have the potential to drive a consolidated, measurable, and balanced risk assessment and management strategy for the prevention and intervention of the sequelae of mental ill-health.\nAthletes are an at-risk subpopulation for mental health problems. However, a subgroup of high-level athletes displayed a resilience that helped them to positively adjust after a period of overwhelming stress. Further consideration of stress and adjustments in brief screening tools is recommended to validate this finding. There is an unrealized potential for broadening the scope of mental health, especially symptom and disorder interpretation. Digital platforms for psychological screening and tracking have been widely used among general populations, but there is yet to be an eminent athlete version. Sports in combination with mental health education should address the barriers to help-seeking by increasing awareness, from mental ill-health to positive functioning. A hybrid model of care is recommended, combining traditional face-to-face approaches along with innovative and evaluated digital technologies, that may be used in prevention and early intervention strategies.", "Membrane proteins are among the most challenging systems to study with experimental structural biology techniques. The increased number of deposited structures of membrane proteins has opened the route to modeling their complexes by methods such as docking. Here, we present an integrative computational protocol for the modeling of membrane-associated protein assemblies. The information encoded by the membrane is represented by artificial beads, which allow targeting of the docking toward the binding-competent regions. It combines efficient, artificial intelligence-based rigid-body docking by LightDock with a flexible final refinement with HADDOCK to remove potential clashes at the interface. We demonstrate the performance of this protocol on eighteen membrane-associated complexes, whose interface lies between the membrane and either the cytosolic or periplasmic regions. In addition, we provide a comparison to another state-of-the-art docking software, ZDOCK. This protocol should shed light on the still dark fraction of the interactome consisting of membrane proteins.", "What is the role of errors in infants' acquisition of basic skills such as walking, skills that require immense amounts of practice to become flexible and generative? Do infants change their behaviors based on negative feedback from errors, as suggested by \"reinforcement learning\" in artificial intelligence, or do errors go largely unmarked so that learning relies on positive feedback? We used falling as a model system to examine the impact of errors in infant development. We examined fall severity based on parent reports of prior falls and videos of 563 falls incurred by 138 13- to 19-month-old infants during free play in a laboratory playroom. Parent reports of notable falls were limited to 33% of infants and medical attention was limited to 2% of infants. Video-recorded falls were typically low-impact events. After falling during free play in the laboratory, infants rarely fussed (4% of falls), caregivers rarely showed concern (8% of falls), and infants were back at play within seconds. Impact forces were mitigated by infants' effective reactive behaviors, quick arrest of the fall before torso or head impact, and small body size. Moreover, falling did not alter infants' subsequent behavior. Infants were not deterred from locomotion or from interacting with the objects and elevations implicated in their falls. We propose that a system that discounts the impact of errors in early stages of development encourages infants to practice basic skills such as walking to the point of mastery.", "Anaesthesia is a stressful medical specialty. The reaction to stress is constituted by behavioural, psychological and physiological components. Chronic physiological stress can have negative consequences for health.\nFirst, we hypothesised that chronic physiological stress is higher for both beginning and late-career consultant anaesthesiologists. Second, we hypothesised that individuals high in emotional intelligence endure lower physiological stress.\nCross-sectional biomarker and survey study.\nParticipants were recruited during the May 2019 annual meeting of the Dutch Anaesthesia Society.\nOf the 1348 colleagues who attended the meeting, 184 (70\u200amale/114 female) participated in the study. Of the study participants, 123 (67%) were consultant anaesthesiologists (52\u200amale/71 female) and 61 (33%) were resident anaesthesiologists (18\u200amale/43 female). Exclusion criteria were endocrine disorders and not having enough hair. Also, experience of a recent major life event led to exclusion from analysis of our hypotheses.\nChronic physiological stress was measured by hair cortisol concentration. Emotional intelligence was assessed using a validated Dutch version of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. As secondary measures, psychological sources of stress were assessed using validated Dutch versions of the home-work interference (SWING) and the effort-reward imbalance questionnaires.\nIn support of Hypothesis 1, hair cortisol concentration was highest among early and late-career consultant anaesthesiologists (quadratic effect: b\u200a=\u200a45.5, SE\u200a=\u200a16.1, t\u200a=\u200a2.8, P\u200a=\u200a0.006, R2\u200a=\u200a0.14). This nonlinear pattern was not mirrored by self-reported sources of psychological stress. Our results did not support Hypothesis 2; we found no evidence for a relationship between emotional intelligence and physiological stress.\nIn the early and later phases of an anaesthesiologist's career, physiological chronic stress is higher than in the middle of the career. However, this physiological response could not be explained from known sources of psychological stress. We discuss these findings against the background of key differences between physiological and psychological stress.", "We have proposed a new tumor sensitization and targeting (TST) framework, named in vivo computation, in our previous investigations. The problem of TST for an early and microscopic tumor is interpreted from the computational perspective with nanorobots being the \"natural\" computing agents, the high-risk tissue being the search space, the tumor targeted being the global optimal solution, and the tumor-triggered biological gradient field (BGF) providing the aided knowledge for fitness evaluation of nanorobots. This natural computation process can be seen as on-the-fly path planning for nanorobot swarms with an unknown target position, which is different from the traditional path planning methods. Our previous works are focusing on the TST for a solitary lesion, where we proposed the weak priority evolution strategy (WP-ES) to adapt to the actuating mode of the homogeneous magnetic field used in the state-of-the-art nanorobotic platforms, and some in vitro validations were performed. In this paper, we focus on the problem of TST for multifocal tumors, which can be seen as a multimodal optimization problem for the \"natural\" computation. To overcome this issue, we propose a sequential targeting strategy (Se-TS) to complete TST for the multiple lesions with the assistance of nanorobot swarms, which are maneuvered by the external actuating and tracking devices according to the WP-ES. The Se-TS is used to modify the BGF landscape after a tumor is detected by a nanorobot swarm with the gathered BGF information around the detected tumor. Next, another nanorobot swarm will be employed to find the second tumor according to the modified BGF landscape without being misguided to the previous one. In this way, all the tumor lesions will be detected one by one. In other words, the paths of nanorobots to find the targets can be generated successively with the sequential modification of the BGF landscape. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Se-TS, we perform comprehensive simulation studies by enhancing the WP-ES based swarm intelligence algorithms using this strategy considering the realistic in-body constraints. The performance is compared against that of the \"brute-force\" search, which corresponds to the traditional systemic tumor targeting, and also against that of the standard swarm intelligence algorithms from the algorithmic perspective. Furthermore, some in vitro experiments are performed by using Janus microparticles as magnetic nanorobots, a two-dimensional microchannel network as the human vasculature, and a magnetic nanorobotic control system as the external actuating and tracking system. Results from the in silico simulations and in vitro experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed Se-TS for two representative BGF landscapes.", "Internet is essential part of everyday life and certainly facilitate it on several levels. It is a helpful information tool, and knowledge, but its unlimited range often is risky for users. The behaviors and outcomes of internet abuse have already been well-documented in the literature; less is known about the role of personal factors that reinforce internet addiction. Based on the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model (I-PACE), the current study investigates the role of trait emotional intelligence and self-esteem, age, and gender in relation to addictive internet behaviors. We conducted an online investigation among respondents. The participants were Italian university students who voluntarily completed the Abuse Internet Addiction scale (UADI) and the Rosenberg Self-esteem scale. Path analysis results revealed that both trait emotional intelligence and self-esteem had a protective direct effect on addictive internet behaviors. Age negatively affects addictive internet behaviors; younger are more likely to develop addictive internet behaviors than older individuals. Finally, we did not find an effect of gender on addictive internet behaviors. Our results suggest the need to develop prevention plans for addictive internet behaviors and educational programs to increase emotional intelligence and self-esteem components to help younger to improve interpersonal and emotional management skills to better handle their internet use.", "Children with sensorineural hearing loss show considerable variability in spoken language outcomes. The present study tested whether specific deficits in supra-threshold auditory perception might contribute to this variability. In a previous study by Halliday, Rosen, Tuomainen, and Calcus [(2019). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 146, 4299], children with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss (MMHL) were shown to perform more poorly than those with normal hearing (NH) on measures designed to assess sensitivity to the temporal fine structure (TFS; the rapid oscillations in the amplitude of narrowband signals over short time intervals). However, they performed within normal limits on measures assessing sensitivity to the envelope (E; the slow fluctuations in the overall amplitude). Here, individual differences in unaided sensitivity to the TFS accounted for significant variance in the spoken language abilities of children with MMHL after controlling for nonverbal intelligence quotient, family history of language difficulties, and hearing loss severity. Aided sensitivity to the TFS and E cues was equally important for children with MMHL, whereas for children with NH, E cues were more important. These findings suggest that deficits in TFS perception may contribute to the variability in spoken language outcomes in children with sensorineural hearing loss.", "Prediction of survival after the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been widely investigated, yet remains inadequate. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a valid adjunct to traditional statistics due to the ability to process vast amounts of data and find hidden interconnections between variables. AI and deep learning are increasingly employed in several topics of liver cancer research, including diagnosis, pathology, and prognosis.\nTo assess the role of AI in the prediction of survival following HCC treatment.\nA web-based literature search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines using the keywords \"artificial intelligence\", \"deep learning\" and \"hepatocellular carcinoma\" (and synonyms). The specific research question was formulated following the patient (patients with HCC), intervention (evaluation of HCC treatment using AI), comparison (evaluation without using AI), and outcome (patient death and/or tumor recurrence) structure. English language articles were retrieved, screened, and reviewed by the authors. The quality of the papers was assessed using the Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool. Data were extracted and collected in a database.\nAmong the 598 articles screened, nine papers met the inclusion criteria, six of which had low-risk rates of bias. Eight articles were published in the last decade; all came from eastern countries. Patient sample size was extremely heterogenous (n = 11-22926). AI methodologies employed included artificial neural networks (ANN) in six studies, as well as support vector machine, artificial plant optimization, and peritumoral radiomics in the remaining three studies. All the studies testing the role of ANN compared the performance of ANN with traditional statistics. Training cohorts were used to train the neural networks that were then applied to validation cohorts. In all cases, the AI models demonstrated superior predictive performance compared with traditional statistics with significantly improved areas under the curve.\nAI applied to survival prediction after HCC treatment provided enhanced accuracy compared with conventional linear systems of analysis. Improved transferability and reproducibility will facilitate the widespread use of AI methodologies.", "As a new-era of energy harvesting technology, the enhancement of triboelectric charge density of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is always crucial for its large-scale application on Internet of Things (IoTs) and artificial intelligence (AI). Here, a microstructure-designed direct-current TENG (MDC-TENG) with rationally patterned electrode structure is presented to enhance its effective surface charge density by increasing the efficiency of contact electrification. Thus, the MDC-TENG achieves a record high charge density of ~5.4\u2009mC\u2009m-2, which is over 2-fold the state-of-art of AC-TENGs and over 10-fold compared to previous DC-TENGs. The MDC-TENG realizes both the miniaturized device and high output performance. Meanwhile, its effective charge density can be further improved as the device size increases. Our work not only provides a miniaturization strategy of TENG for the application in IoTs and AI as energy supply or self-powered sensor, but also presents a paradigm shift for large-scale energy harvesting by TENGs.", "The fields of computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (AI) have undergone rapid advancements in the past decade, many of which have been applied to the analysis of intraoperative video. These advances are driven by wide-spread application of deep learning, which leverages multiple layers of neural networks to teach computers complex tasks. Prior to these advances, applications of AI in the operating room were limited by our relative inability to train computers to accurately understand images with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques. The development and refining of deep neural networks that can now accurately identify objects in images and remember past surgical events has sparked a surge in the applications of CV to analyze intraoperative video and has allowed for the accurate identification of surgical phases (steps) and instruments across a variety of procedures. In some cases, CV can even identify operative phases with accuracy similar to surgeons. Future research will likely expand on this foundation of surgical knowledge using larger video datasets and improved algorithms with greater accuracy and interpretability to create clinically useful AI models that gain widespread adoption and augment the surgeon's ability to provide safer care for patients everywhere.", "The COVID-19 pandemic put significant strain on societies and their resources, with the healthcare system and workers being particularly affected. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers the unique possibility of improving the response to a pandemic as it emerges and evolves. Here, we utilize the WHO framework of a pandemic evolution to analyze the various AI applications. Specifically, we analyzed AI from the perspective of all five domains of the WHO pandemic response. To effectively review the current scattered literature, we organized a sample of relevant literature from various professional and popular resources. The article concludes with a consideration of AI's weaknesses as key factors affecting AI in future pandemic preparedness and response.", "Consumer-oriented mobile self-diagnosis apps have been developed using undisclosed algorithms, presumably based on machine learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The US Food and Drug Administration now discerns apps with learning AI algorithms from those with stable ones and treats the former as medical devices. To the author's knowledge, no self-diagnosis app testing has been performed in the field of ophthalmology so far.\nThe objective of this study was to test apps that were previously mentioned in the scientific literature on a set of diagnoses in a deliberate time interval, comparing the results and looking for differences that hint at \"nonlocked\" learning algorithms.\nFour apps from the literature were chosen (Ada, Babylon, Buoy, and Your.MD). A set of three ophthalmology diagnoses (glaucoma, retinal tear, dry eye syndrome) representing three levels of urgency was used to simultaneously test the apps' diagnostic efficiency and treatment recommendations in this specialty. Two years was the chosen time interval between the tests (2018 and 2020). Scores were awarded by one evaluating physician using a defined scheme.\nTwo apps (Ada and Your.MD) received significantly higher scores than the other two. All apps either worsened in their results between 2018 and 2020 or remained unchanged at a low level. The variation in the results over time indicates \"nonlocked\" learning algorithms using AI technologies. None of the apps provided correct diagnoses and treatment recommendations for all three diagnoses in 2020. Two apps (Babylon and Your.MD) asked significantly fewer questions than the other two (P<.001).\n\"Nonlocked\" algorithms are used by self-diagnosis apps. The diagnostic efficiency of the tested apps seems to worsen over time, with some apps being more capable than others. Systematic studies on a wider scale are necessary for health care providers and patients to correctly assess the safety and efficacy of such apps and for correct classification by health care regulating authorities.", "The aim was to determine the effects of compassion fatigue, emotional intelligence levels, and communication skills of organ transplant coordinators on burnout.\nThis descriptive correlational study included 104 organ transplant coordinators. Data were collected via a survey that consisted of demographic information, the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, the Emotional Intelligence Scale, and the Compassion Fatigue Scale.\nA positive relationship was reported between burnout (mean, 39.42 [SD, 19.54]) and compassion fatigue (mean, 2.26 [SD, 0.86]) measurements of the organ transplant coordinators (r\u00a0= 0.432) and a negative and significant relationship existed between burnout and emotional intelligence (mean, 3.53 [SD, 0.58]) measurements (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.372). However, no correlation was found between communication skills (mean, 4.27 [SD, 0.52]) and burnout (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.184; P > .05) except a negative correlation with client-related burnout measurements (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.222; P\u00a0< .05). As a result of the 2-step regression analysis, the regression-squared value predicted the joint effect of compassion fatigue and emotional intelligence on burnout (R2 = .285).\nOrgan transplant coordinators reported moderate levels of burnout and compassion fatigue and high levels of emotional intelligence and communication skills. Compassion fatigue caused burnout, while emotional intelligence decreased. Additionally, transplant coordinators' communication skills were related to client-related burnout.", "Electronic health record (EHR) vendors now offer \"off-the-shelf\" artificial intelligence (AI) models to client organizations. Our health system faced difficulties in promoting end-user utilization of a new AI model for predicting readmissions embedded in the EHR.\nThe aim is to conduct a case study centered on identifying barriers to uptake/utilization.\nA qualitative study was conducted using interviews with stakeholders. The interviews were used to identify relevant stakeholders, understand current workflows, identify implementation barriers, and formulate future strategies.\nWe discovered substantial variation in existing workflows around readmissions. Some stakeholders did not perform any formal readmissions risk assessment. Others accustomed to using existing risk scores such as LACE+ had concerns about transitioning to a new model. Some stakeholders had existing workflows in place that could accommodate the new model, but they were not previously aware that the new model was in production. Concerns expressed by end-users included: whether the model's predictors were relevant to their work, need for adoption of additional workflow processes, need for training and change management, and potential for unintended consequences (e.g., increased health care resource utilization due to potentially over-referring discharged patients to home health services).\nAI models for risk stratification, even if \"off-the-shelf\" by design, are unlikely to be \"plug-and-play\" in health care settings. Seeking out key stakeholders and defining clear use cases early in the implementation process can better facilitate utilization of these models.", "To determine whether smart conversational agents can be used for detection of neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, we reviewed the technologies used, targeted mental disorders and validation procedures of relevant proposals in this field.\nWe searched Scopus, PubMed, Pro-Quest, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included if they focused on neuropsychiatric disorders and involved conversational data for detection and diagnosis. They were assessed for eligibility by independent reviewers and ultimately included if a consensus was reached about their relevance.\n2356 references were initially retrieved. Eventually, 17 articles - referring 9 smart conversational agents - met the inclusion criteria. Out of the selected studies, 7 are targeted at neurocognitive disorders, 7 at depression and 3 at other conditions. They apply diverse technological solutions and analysis techniques (82.4% use Artificial Intelligence), and they usually rely on gold standard tests for criterion validity assessment. Acceptability, reliability and other aspects of validity were rarely addressed.\nThe use of smart conversational agents for the detection of neuropsychiatric disorders is an emerging and promising field of research, with a broad coverage of mental disorders and extended use of AI. However, the few published studies did not undergo robust psychometric validation processes. Future research in this field would benefit from more rigorous validation mechanisms and standardized software and hardware platforms.", "Early treatment of primary congenital hypothyroidism (CH) prevents irreversible brain damage. Contrary to primary CH, outcome studies on central CH are scarce. Most patients with central CH have multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (MPHD); these patients are also at risk for neonatal hypoglycemia.\nTo assess cognitive and motor outcome in patients with early-treated central CH detected by the Dutch neonatal screening.\nIn this cross-sectional study, primary outcome full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) was measured in patients with MPHD and patients with isolated central CH born between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2015, with siblings as controls. Secondary outcomes were intelligence test subscales and motor function. Linear mixed models were used to compare both patient groups and siblings, followed by post hoc tests in case of significant differences.\nEighty-seven patients (52 MPHD; 35 isolated central CH) and 52 siblings were included. Estimated marginal means for FSIQ were 90.7 (95% CI 86.4-95.0) in patients with MPHD and 98.2 (95% CI 93.0-103.5) in patients with isolated central CH. While patients with MPHD scored lower FSIQs than siblings (mean difference -7.9 points, 95% CI -13.4 to -2.5; P\u2005=\u2005.002), patients with isolated central CH did not. Processing speed was lower in both patient groups than in siblings (mean differences -10.5 and -10.3 points). Motor difficulties occurred significantly more often in patients (33%) versus siblings (5%; P\u2005=\u2005.004).\nIn early-treated central CH, FSIQ is comparable with siblings in patients with isolated central CH, while patients with MPHD have a significantly lower FSIQ. This may be explained by disease-specific consequences of MPHD, such as neonatal hypoglycemia and more severe hypothyroidism.", "Microfossils are a powerful tool in earth sciences, and they have been widely used for the determination of geological age and in paleoenvironmental studies. However, the identification of fossil species requires considerable time and labor by experts with extensive knowledge and experience. In this study, we successfully automated the acquisition of microfossil data using an artificial intelligence system that employs a computer-controlled microscope and deep learning methods. The system was used to calculate changes in the relative abundance (%) of Cycladophora davisiana, a siliceous microfossil species (Radiolaria) that is widely used as a stratigraphic tool in studies on Pleistocene sediments in the Southern Ocean. The estimates obtained using this system were consistent with the results obtained by a human expert (<\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2%). In terms of efficiency, the developed system was capable of performing the classification tasks approximately three times faster than a human expert performing the same task.", "Thyroid nodules are common, and their investigation is very important to exclude the possibility of cancer. The increase in blood vessels of malignant tumours may be related to local temperature augmentation detectable on the skin surface. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the feasibility of Infrared Thermography for cancer identification. For this purpose, two studies were performed. One used numerical modelling to simulate regional metabolic temperature propagation to evaluate whether a nodule is perceptible on the skin surface. A second study considered thyroid nodule identification by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). First, variations in nodular size and fat thickness were investigated, showing that the fat layer has an important role in regional heat transfer. In the second study, the training process achieved accuracy of 96% for in-sample and 95% for validation. In the testing phase, 92% accuracy, 100% precision and 80% recall were achieved. Thus, the presented studies suggest the feasibility of using Infrared Thermography with the CNN Artificial Intelligence technique as additional information in the investigation of thyroid nodules for patients without a very thick subcutaneous fat layer.", "Observation of the entire stomach during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is important; however, there is a lack of effective evaluation tools.\nTo develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted EGD system able to automatically monitor blind spots in real-time.\nAn AI-based system, called the Intelligent Detection Endoscopic Assistant (IDEA), was developed using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The performance of IDEA for recognition of gastric sites in images and videos was evaluated. Primary outcomes included diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\nA total of 170,297 images and 5779 endoscopic videos were collected to develop the system. As the test group, 3100 EGD images were acquired to evaluate the performance of DCNN in recognition of gastric sites in images. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of DCNN were determined as 97.18%,99.91%, and 99.83%, respectively. To assess the performance of IDEA in recognition of gastric sites in EGD videos, 129 videos were used as the test group. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of IDEA were 96.29%,93.32%, and 95.30%, respectively.\nIDEA achieved high accuracy for recognition of gastric sites in real-time. The system can be applied as a powerful assistant tool for monitoring blind spots during EGD.", "Full notification of deaths and compilation of good quality cause of death data are core, sequential and essential components of a functional civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system. In collaboration with the Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG), trial mortality surveillance activities were established at sites in Alotau District in Milne Bay Province, Tambul-Nebilyer District in Western Highlands Province and Talasea District in West New Britain Province.Provincial Health Authorities trialled strategies to improve completeness of death notification and implement an automated verbal autopsy methodology, including use of different notification agents and paper or mobile phone methods. Completeness of death notification improved from virtually 0% to 20% in Talasea, 25% and 75% using mobile phone and paper notification strategies, respectively, in Alotau, and 69% in Tambul-Nebilyer. We discuss the challenges and lessons learnt with implementing these activities in PNG, including logistical considerations and incentives.Our experience indicates that strategies to maximise completeness of notification should be tailored to the local context, which in PNG includes significant geographical, cultural and political diversity. We report that health workers have great potential to improve the CRVS programme in PNG through managing the collection of notification and verbal autopsy data. In light of our findings, and in consultation with the main government CRVS stakeholders and the National CRVS Committee, we make recommendations regarding the requirements at each level of the health system to optimise mortality surveillance in order to generate the essential health intelligence required for policy and planning.", "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an emerging preventable cause of blindness in India. All India Ophthalmology Society (AIOS) and Vitreo-Retinal Society of India (VRSI) have initiated several measures to improve of DR screening in India. This article is a consensus statement of the AIOS DR task force and VRSI on practical guidelines of DR screening in India. Although there are regional variations in the prevalence of diabetes in India at present, all the States in India should screen their population for diabetes and its complications. The purpose of DR screening is to identify people with sight-threatening DR (STDR) so that they are treated promptly to prevent blindness. This statement provides strategies for the identification of people with diabetes for DR screening, recommends screening intervals in people with diabetes with and without DR, and describes screening models that are feasible in India. The logistics of DR screening emphasizes the need for dynamic referral pathways with feedback mechanisms. It provides the clinical standards required for DR screening and treatment of STDR and addresses the governance and quality assurance (QA) standards for DR screening in Indian settings. Other aspects incorporate education and training, recommendations on Information technology (IT) infrastructure, potential use of artificial intelligence for grading, data capture, and requirements for maintenance of a DR registry. Finally, the recommendations include public awareness and the need to work with diabetologists to control the risk factors so as to have a long-term impact on prevention of diabetes blindness in India.", "nowadays, considering the number of patients per specialist doctor, the size of the need for automatic medical image analysis methods can be understood. These systems, which are very advantageous compared to manual systems both in terms of cost and time, benefit from artificial intelligence (AI). AI mechanisms that mimic the decision-making process of a specialist increase their diagnosis performance day by day, depending on technological developments. In this study, an AI method is proposed to effectively classify Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract Image datasets containing a small number of labeled data. The proposed AI method uses the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is accepted as the most successful automatic classification method of today, as a backbone. According to our approach, a shallowly trained CNN architecture needs to be supported by a strong classifier to classify unbalanced datasets robustly. For this purpose, the features in each pooling layer in the CNN architecture are transmitted to an LSTM layer. A classification is made by combining all LSTM layers. All experiments are carried out using AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet to evaluate the contribution of the proposed residual LSTM structure fairly. Besides, three different experiments are carried out with 2000, 4000, and 6000 samples to determine the effect of sample number change on the proposed method. The performance of the proposed method is higher than other state-of-the-art methods.", "Explainability is one of the most heavily debated topics when it comes to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Even though AI-driven systems have been shown to outperform humans in certain analytical tasks, the lack of explainability continues to spark criticism. Yet, explainability is not a purely technological issue, instead it invokes a host of medical, legal, ethical, and societal questions that require thorough exploration. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of explainability in medical AI and makes an ethical evaluation of what explainability means for the adoption of AI-driven tools into clinical practice.\nTaking AI-based clinical decision support systems as a case in point, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the relevance of explainability for medical AI from the technological, legal, medical, and patient perspectives. Drawing on the findings of this conceptual analysis, we then conducted an ethical assessment using the \"Principles of Biomedical Ethics\" by Beauchamp and Childress (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) as an analytical framework to determine the need for explainability in medical AI.\nEach of the domains highlights a different set of core considerations and values that are relevant for understanding the role of explainability in clinical practice. From the technological point of view, explainability has to be considered both in terms how it can be achieved and what is beneficial from a development perspective. When looking at the legal perspective we identified informed consent, certification and approval as medical devices, and liability as core touchpoints for explainability. Both the medical and patient perspectives emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between human actors and medical AI. We conclude that omitting explainability in clinical decision support systems poses a threat to core ethical values in medicine and may have detrimental consequences for individual and public health.\nTo ensure that medical AI lives up to its promises, there is a need to sensitize developers, healthcare professionals, and legislators to the challenges and limitations of opaque algorithms in medical AI and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration moving forward.", "Personalized precision medicine requires highly accurate diagnostics. While radiological research has focused on scanner and sequence technologies in recent decades, applications of artificial intelligence are increasingly attracting scientific interest as they could substantially expand the possibility of objective quantification and diagnostic or prognostic use of image information.In this context, the term \"radiomics\" describes the extraction of quantitative features from imaging data such as those obtained from computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging examinations. These features are associated with predictive goals such as diagnosis or prognosis using machine learning models. It is believed that the integrative assessment of the feature patterns thus obtained, in combination with clinical, molecular and genetic data, can enable a more accurate characterization of the pathophysiology of diseases and more precise prediction of therapy response and outcome.This review describes the classical radiomics approach and discusses the existing very large variability of approaches. Finally, it outlines the research directions in which the interdisciplinary field of radiology and computer science is moving, characterized by increasingly close collaborations and the need for new educational concepts. The aim is to provide a basis for responsible and comprehensible handling of the data and analytical methods used.

Diverse deep learning models (DLMs) have been developed, but they could not be applied in clinical practice owing to their lack of interpretability. We developed an explainable DLM to detect AF using ECG and validated its performance using diverse formats of ECG.\nWe conducted a retrospective study. The Sejong ECG dataset comprising 128,399 ECGs was used to develop and internally validated the explainable DLM. DLM was developed with two feature modules, which could describe the reason for DLM decisions. DLM was external validated using data from 21,837, 10,605, and 8528 ECGs from PTB-XL, Chapman, and PhysioNet non-restricted datasets, respectively. The predictor variables were digitally stored ECGs, and the endpoints were AFs.\nDuring internal and external validation of the DLM, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the DLM using a 12\u2011lead ECG in detecting AF were 0.997-0.999. The AUCs of the DLM with VAE using a 6\u2011lead and single\u2011lead ECG were 0.990-0.999. The AUCs of explainability about features such as rhythm irregularity and absence of P-wave were 0.961-0.993 and 0.983-0.993, respectively.\nOur DLM successfully detected AF using diverse ECGs and described the reason for this decision. The results indicated that an explainable artificial intelligence methodology could be adopted to the DLM using ECG and enhance the transparency of the DLM for its application in clinical practice.", "Performing systematic reviews is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.\nWe investigated whether a machine learning system could perform systematic reviews more efficiently.\nAll systematic reviews and meta-analyses of interventional randomized controlled trials cited in recent clinical guidelines from the American Diabetes Association, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association (2 guidelines), and American Stroke Association were assessed. After reproducing the primary screening data set according to the published search strategy of each, we extracted correct articles (those actually reviewed) and incorrect articles (those not reviewed) from the data set. These 2 sets of articles were used to train a neural network-based artificial intelligence engine (Concept Encoder, Fronteo Inc). The primary endpoint was work saved over sampling at 95% recall (WSS@95%).\nAmong 145 candidate reviews of randomized controlled trials, 8 reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For these 8 reviews, the machine learning system significantly reduced the literature screening workload by at least 6-fold versus that of manual screening based on WSS@95%. When machine learning was initiated using 2 correct articles that were randomly selected by a researcher, a 10-fold reduction in workload was achieved versus that of manual screening based on the WSS@95% value, with high sensitivity for eligible studies. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased dramatically every time the algorithm learned a correct article.\nConcept Encoder achieved a 10-fold reduction of the screening workload for systematic review after learning from 2 randomly selected studies on the target topic. However, few meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were included. Concept Encoder could facilitate the acquisition of evidence for clinical guidelines.", "Nearly one-quarter of all cancer deaths worldwide are due to lung cancer, making this disease the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women. The most important determinant of survival in lung cancer is the disease stage at diagnosis, thus developing an effective screening method for early diagnosis has been a long-term goal in lung cancer care. In the last decade, and based on the results of large clinical trials, lung cancer screening programs using low-dose computer tomography (LDCT) in high-risk individuals have been implemented in some clinical settings, however, this method has various limitations, especially a high false-positive rate which eventually results in a number of unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions among the screened subjects. By using complex algorithms and software, artificial intelligence (AI) is capable to emulate human cognition in the analysis, interpretation, and comprehension of complicated data and currently, it is being successfully applied in various healthcare settings. Taking advantage of the ability of AI to quantify information from images, and its superior capability in recognizing complex patterns in images compared to humans, AI has the potential to aid clinicians in the interpretation of LDCT images obtained in the setting of lung cancer screening. In the last decade, several AI models aimed to improve lung cancer detection have been reported. Some algorithms performed equal or even outperformed experienced radiologists in distinguishing benign from malign lung nodules and some of those models improved diagnostic accuracy and decreased the false-positive rate. Here, we discuss recent publications in which AI algorithms are utilized to assess chest computer tomography (CT) scans imaging obtaining in the setting of lung cancer screening.", "In the process of software development, regression testing is one of the major activities that is done after making modifications in the current system or whenever a software system evolves. But, the test suite size increases with the addition of new test cases and it becomes in-efficient because of the occurrence of redundant, broken, and obsolete test cases. For that reason, it results in additional time and budget to run all these test cases. Many researchers have proposed computational intelligence and conventional approaches for dealing with this problem and they have achieved an optimized test suite by selecting, minimizing or reducing, and prioritizing test cases. Currently, most of these optimization approaches are single objective and static in nature. But, it is mandatory to use multi-objective dynamic approaches for optimization due to the advancements in information technology and associated market challenges. Therefore, we have proposed three variants of self-tunable Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System i.e. TLBO-ANFIS, FA-ANFIS, and HS-ANFIS, for multi-objective regression test suites optimization. Two benchmark test suites are used for evaluating the proposed ANFIS variants. The performance of proposed ANFIS variants is measured using Standard Deviation and Root Mean Square Error. A comparison of experimental results is also done with six existing methods i.e. GA-ANFIS, PSO-ANFIS, MOGA, NSGA-II, MOPSO, and TOPSIS and it is concluded that the proposed method effectively reduces the size of regression test suite without a reduction in the fault detection rate.", "pH sensors with low-power and strong anti-interference are extremely important for industrial online real-time detection. Herein, a narrow channel pH sensor based on Al0.25Ga0.75N/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) with package integrated Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels is proposed. The fabricated device has shown potential advantages in improving stability and reducing power consumption in response to pH changes of the solution. The performance of the pH sensor was demonstrated where the preliminary results showed an ultra-low power (<5.0 \u03bcW) at VDS = 1.0 V. Meanwhile, the sensitivity was 0.06 \u03bcA/V\u00b7pH in the range of pH = 2 to pH = 10, and the resolution of the sensor was 0.1 pH. The improvement in performance of the proposed sensor can be related to the narrow channel and microchannel, which can be attributed to better surface GaxOy in a microchannel with larger H+ and HO- concentration on the sensing surface during the detection process. The low-power sensor with excellent stability can be widely used in various unattended or harsh environments, and it is more conducive to integration and intelligence, which lays the foundation for online monitoring in vivo.", "Understanding the emergence, co-evolution, and convergence of science and technology (S&T) areas offers competitive intelligence for researchers, managers, policy makers, and others. This paper presents new funding, publication, and scholarly network metrics and visualizations that were validated via expert surveys. The metrics and visualizations exemplify the emergence and convergence of three areas of strategic interest: artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and internet of things (IoT) over the last 20 years (1998-2017). For 32,716 publications and 4,497 NSF awards, we identify their topical coverage (using the UCSD map of science), evolving co-author networks, and increasing convergence. The results support data-driven decision making when setting proper research and development (R&D) priorities; developing future S&T investment strategies; or performing effective research program assessment.", "Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and disability worldwide. Nevertheless, the majority of patients do not know they have the disease and detection of glaucoma progression using standard technology remains a challenge in clinical practice. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an expanding field that offers the potential to improve diagnosis and screening for glaucoma with minimal reliance on human input. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have risen to the forefront of AI by providing nearly human-level performance, at times exceeding the performance of humans for detection of glaucoma on structural and functional tests. A succinct summary of present studies and challenges to be addressed in this field is needed. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of studies that applied DL methods for detection of glaucoma using color fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography (OCT), or standard automated perimetry (SAP). In this review article we describe recent advances in DL as applied to the diagnosis of glaucoma and glaucoma progression for application in screening and clinical settings, as well as the challenges that remain when applying this novel technique in glaucoma.", "COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV is no longer pandemic but rather endemic, with more than 651,247 people around world having lost their lives after contracting the disease. Currently, there is no specific treatment or cure for COVID-19, and thus living with the disease and its symptoms is inevitable. This reality has placed a massive burden on limited healthcare systems worldwide especially in the developing nations. Although neither an effective, clinically proven antiviral agents' strategy nor an approved vaccine exist to eradicate the COVID-19 pandemic, there are alternatives that may reduce the huge burden on not only limited healthcare systems but also the economic sector; the most promising include harnessing non-clinical techniques such as machine learning, data mining, deep learning and other artificial intelligence. These alternatives would facilitate diagnosis and prognosis for 2019-nCoV pandemic patients. Supervised machine learning models for COVID-19 infection were developed in this work with learning algorithms which include logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine, naive Bayes, and artificial neutral network using epidemiology labeled dataset for positive and negative COVID-19 cases of Mexico. The correlation coefficient analysis between various dependent and independent features was carried out to determine a strength relationship between each dependent feature and independent feature of the dataset prior to developing the models. The 80% of the training dataset were used for training the models while the remaining 20% were used for testing the models. The result of the performance evaluation of the models showed that decision tree model has the highest accuracy of 94.99% while the Support Vector Machine Model has the highest sensitivity of 93.34% and Na\u00efve Bayes Model has the highest specificity of 94.30%.", "The rise of novel artificial intelligence (AI) methods necessitates their benchmarking against classical machine learning for a typical drug-discovery project. Inhibition of the potassium ion channel, whose alpha subunit is encoded by the human ether-\u00e0-go-go-related gene (hERG), leads to a prolonged QT interval of the cardiac action potential and is a significant safety pharmacology target for the development of new medicines. Several computational approaches have been employed to develop prediction models for the assessment of hERG liabilities of small molecules including recent work using deep learning methods. Here, we perform a comprehensive comparison of hERG effect prediction models based on classical approaches (random forests and gradient boosting) and modern AI methods [deep neural networks (DNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)]. The training set (\u223c9000 compounds) was compiled by integrating the hERG bioactivity data from the ChEMBL database with experimental data generated from an in-house, high-throughput thallium flux assay. We utilized different molecular descriptors including the latent descriptors, which are real-value continuous vectors derived from chemical autoencoders trained on a large chemical space (>1.5 million compounds). The models were prospectively validated on \u223c840 in-house compounds screened in the same thallium flux assay. The best results were obtained with the XGBoost method and RDKit descriptors. The comparison of models based only on latent descriptors revealed that the DNNs performed significantly better than the classical methods. The RNNs that operate on SMILES provided the highest model sensitivity. The best models were merged into a consensus model that offered superior performance compared to reference models from academic and commercial domains. Furthermore, we shed light on the potential of AI methods to exploit the big data in chemistry and generate novel chemical representations useful in predictive modeling and tailoring a new chemical space.", "Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) diagnosis currently requires quite a long time span. A quicker and more efficient diagnostic tool in emergency departments could improve management during this global crisis. Our main goal was assessing the accuracy of artificial intelligence in predicting the results of RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2, using basic information at hand in all emergency departments.\nThis is a retrospective study carried out between February 22, 2020 and March 16, 2020 in one of the main hospitals in Milan, Italy. We screened for eligibility all patients admitted with influenza-like symptoms tested for SARS-COV-2. Patients under 12\u2009years old and patients in whom the leukocyte formula was not performed in the ED were excluded. Input data through artificial intelligence were made up of a combination of clinical, radiological and routine laboratory data upon hospital admission. Different Machine Learning algorithms available on WEKA data mining software and on Semeion Research Centre depository were trained using both the Training and Testing and the K-fold cross-validation protocol.\nAmong 199 patients subject to study (median [interquartile range] age 65 [46-78] years; 127 [63.8%] men), 124 [62.3%] resulted positive to SARS-COV-2. The best Machine Learning System reached an accuracy of 91.4% with 94.1% sensitivity and 88.7% specificity.\nOur study suggests that properly trained artificial intelligence algorithms may be able to predict correct results in RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2, using basic clinical data. If confirmed, on a larger-scale study, this approach could have important clinical and organizational implications.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) raises many expectations regarding its ability to profoundly transform health care delivery. There is an abundant literature on the technical performance of AI applications in many clinical fields (e.g. radiology, ophthalmology). This article aims to bring forward the importance of studying organizational readiness to integrate AI into health care delivery.\nThe reflection is based on our experience in digital health technologies, diffusion of innovations and healthcare organizations and systems. It provides insights into why and how organizational readiness should be carefully considered.\nAs an important step to ensure successful integration of AI and avoid unnecessary investments and costly failures, better consideration should be given to: (1) Needs and added-value assessment; (2) Workplace readiness: stakeholder acceptance and engagement; (3) Technology-organization alignment assessment and (4) Business plan: financing and investments. In summary, decision-makers and technology promoters should better address the complexity of AI and understand the systemic challenges raised by its implementation in healthcare organizations and systems.\nFew studies have focused on the organizational issues raised by the integration of AI into clinical routine. The current context is marked by a perplexing gap between the willingness of decision-makers and technology promoters to capitalize on AI applications to improve health care delivery and the reality on the ground, where it is difficult to initiate the changes needed to realize their full benefits while avoiding their negative impacts.", "Background: Severe maternal iodine deficiency during pregnancy leads to marked intellectual disability in the offspring. Although recent studies showed that even mild-to-moderate maternal iodine deficiency is associated with lower intelligence quotient and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in offspring, the underlying neurobiological mechanism of these associations remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of maternal iodine excretion during pregnancy with offspring brain morphology during pre-adolescence. Methods: This study was embedded within Generation R, a prospective population-based birth cohort in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We included 990 mother-child pairs with data on urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and creatinine during pregnancy. The UIC was assessed at <18 and/or 18-25 weeks of gestation and offspring brain imaging data were acquired with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at age 10 years. We used linear regression to study the association of the iodine-to-creatinine ratio (UI/Creat) with offspring brain MRI outcomes. Results: Maternal UI/Creat during pregnancy was not consistently associated with offspring brain morphology. A low UI/Creat (<150\u2009\u03bcg/g) during pregnancy was nominally associated with smaller total gray matter volume, but this did not survive correction for multiple testing. Also, we could not identify a linear association between continuous iodine excretion and offspring brain morphology. Instead, our results suggest a curvilinear association between UI/Creat and brain morphology. In sensitivity analyses using the World Health Organization categorization for UIC values, both low and high UI/Creat were associated with smaller total gray matter volume. Conclusions: The current study provides some but no conclusive evidence for an association of maternal iodine excretion during pregnancy with offspring brain morphology. Our results suggest that the exact definition of the reference group is important because of potential non-linear associations, which could be leveraged in future studies.", "Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a cancer associated with increasing incidence and poor survival. Early identification and effective treatment of BE-related neoplasia prior to the development of invasive adenocarcinoma are essential to limiting the morbidity and mortality associated with this cancer. In this review, we summarized the recent evidence guiding endoscopic eradication therapies (EET) for neoplastic BE.\nNew sampling technologies and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) systems have potential to revolutionize early neoplasia detection in BE. EET for BE are safe and effective in achieving complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) and reducing the progression to EAC, a practice endorsed by all GI society guidelines. EET should be considered in patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD), intramucosal carcinoma (IMC), and select cases with low-grade dysplasia (LGD). The increasing use of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in the West may allow EET of select cases with submucosal EAC. Post-EET surveillance strategies will continue to evolve as knowledge of specific risk factors and long-term neoplasia recurrence rates improve. In the last decade, major advancements in EET for neoplastic BE have been achieved. These now represent the standard of care in the management of BE-related dysplasia and intramucosal cancer.", "Developmental systems theory and life span development describe the role of individual-context interactions in individual development but have not directly addressed how individuals pursue achievement goals in institutional contexts. We developed a theory informed by these perspectives that explains how institutional contexts affect emerging adults' success in transitioning to and progressing through college. We theorize that institutional contexts increase individuals' probability of attaining specific goals when they provide stronger channels that offer more versus fewer structural supports for these goals. Moreover, we theorize, these institutional channels influence which individual differences, including belonging certainty, growth mindset of intelligence, and grit, will be useful in goal pursuit, above and beyond individuals' academic preparation and demographic factors. We examined postsecondary goal pursuit over a 6-year period among 1,850 students who attended one of four district high schools in Pennsylvania or Massachusetts. On average, they began the study at 17.91 years of age; 48% were male, 43% belonged to a historically marginalized ethnicity, and 56% had free or reduced lunch status. We found that channel strength and psychological factors interacted in ways predicted by our theory. Higher belonging certainty and growth mindset in Grade 12, which encourage a focus on process and progress, predicted better outcomes in weaker postsecondary channels, especially college enrollment and on-track progress. Higher grit, which encourages a commitment to goal attainment, predicted better outcomes in stronger postsecondary channels, especially on-time graduation. The study locates the importance of psychological factors in predicting goal attainment in different-strength institutional channels during emerging adulthood.

It is caused by variants in FAM111A (NM_001942519.1). In this review, we reported the first Chinese patients, a pair of monozygotic twins, with genetically confirmed KCS type 2 with over 20\u2009years follow-up. We summarized the clinical features of 14 previously reported and genetically confirmed KCS type 2 patients; our twin patients exhibited a unique spinal manifestation which could be an important age-dependent feature of KCS type 2. In this review, over 60% KCS type 2 patients had dental problem and over 80% suffered from refractive errors or structural eye abnormalities. Therefore, early dental, ophthalmological, and orthopedic assessments are warranted for KCS type 2 patients. Micro-orchidism, previously reported in KCS type 2 patients, was also detected in our patients. The possibility of subfertility should be considered in male KCS type 2 patients. A multidisciplinary management approach for this rare syndrome is recommended.", "Protein structure and function can be severely altered by even a single amino acid mutation. Predictions of mutational effects using extensive artificial intelligence (AI)-based models, although accurate, remain as enigmatic as the experimental observations in terms of improving intuitions about the contributions of various factors. Inspired by Lipinski's rules for drug-likeness, we devise simple thresholding criteria on five different descriptors such as conservation, which have so far been limited to qualitative interpretations such as high conservation implies high mutational effect. We analyze systematic deep mutational scanning data of all possible single amino acid substitutions on seven proteins (25153 mutations) to first define these thresholds and then to evaluate the scope and limits of the predictions. At this stage, the approach allows us to comment easily and with a low error rate on the subset of mutations classified as neutral or deleterious by all of the descriptors. We hope that complementary to the accurate AI predictions, these thresholding rules or their subsequent modifications will serve the purpose of codifying the knowledge about the effects of mutations.", "In the gait recognition problem, most studies are devoted to developing gait descriptors rather than introducing new classification methods. This paper proposes hybrid methods that combine regularized discriminant analysis (RDA) and swarm intelligence techniques for gait recognition. The purpose of this study is to develop strategies that will achieve better gait recognition results than those achieved by classical classification methods. In our approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) are used. These techniques tune the observation weights and hyperparameters of the RDA method to minimize the objective function. The experiments conducted on the GPJATK dataset proved the validity of the proposed concept.", "A 39-year-old man with a diffuse axonal injury self-presented to the cognitive function clinic of the Ashikaga Red Cross Hospital complaining of behavioral errors in his daily life, such as scooping hot rice into a glass instead of a bowl or forgetting to turn off the gas stove after cooking. This type of error has been referred to as an action slip-a form of unintentional behavioral error that occurs when an individual attempts to perform an automatic and/or familiar task. In this case, action slips occurred nine times a day on average and had a serious and long-term impact on the man's daily quality of life. To reduce the impact of action slips, we created a one-on-one cognitive intervention that used a combination of mnemonic strategies, such as verbalizing his actions as he carried them out, and external aids, including a waist pouch, a voice-controlled artificial intelligence (AI) speaker, and an AI key finder. After 3 years of intervention, the man reported some improvement in his daily activities and a reduction in the number of action slips. Thus, intervention strategies for individuals with a diffuse axonal injury may benefit from targeting action slips. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of action slips in an individual with a diffuse axonal injury.", "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) is a popular method of resolving complications such as endometriosis, poor egg quality, a genetic disease of mother or father, problems with ovulation, antibody problems that harm sperm or eggs, the inability of sperm to penetrate or survive in the cervical mucus and low sperm counts, resulting human infertility. Nevertheless, IVF does not guarantee success in the fertilization. Choosing IVF is burdensome for the reason of high cost and uncertainty in the result. As the complications and fertilization factors are numerous in the IVF process, it is a cumbersome task for fertility doctors to give an accurate prediction of a successful birth. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been employed in this study for predicting the live-birth occurrence. This work mainly focuses on making predictions of live-birth occurrence when an embryo forms from a couple and not a donor. Here, we compare various AI algorithms, including both classical Machine Learning, deep learning architecture, and an ensemble of algorithms on the publicly available dataset provided by Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Insights on data and metrics such as confusion matrices, F1-score, precision, recall, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are demonstrated in the subsequent sections. The training process has two settings Without feature selection and With feature selection to train classifier models. Machine Learning, Deep learning, ensemble models classification paradigms have been trained in both settings. The Random Forest model achieves the highest F1-score of 76.49% in without feature selection setting. For the same model, the precision, recall, and area under the ROC Curve (ROC AUC) scores are 77%, 76%, and 84.60%, respectively. The success of the pregnancy depends on both male and female traits and living conditions. This study predicts a successful pregnancy through the clinically relevant parameters in In-vitro fertilization. Thus artificial intelligence plays a promising role in decision making process to support the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment etc.", "This paper examined the effects of training in creative problem-solving on intelligence. We revisited Stankov's report on the outcomes of an experiment carried out by R. Kvashchev in former Yugoslavia that reported an IQ increase of seven points, on average, across 28 tests of intelligence. We argue that previous analyses were based on a conservative analytic approach and failed to take into account the reductions in the IQ test variances at the end of the three-years' training. When standard deviations of the initial test and 2nd retest were pooled in the calculation of the effect sizes, the experimental group's performance was 10 IQ points higher on average than that of the control group. Further, with the properly defined measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence, the experimental group showed a 15 IQ points higher increase than the control group. We concluded that prolonged intensive training in creative problem-solving can lead to substantial and positive effects on intelligence during late adolescence (ages 18-19).", "The need to forecast COVID-19 related variables continues to be pressing as the epidemic unfolds. Different efforts have been made, with compartmental models in epidemiology and statistical models such as AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or computing intelligence models. These efforts have proved useful in some instances by allowing decision makers to distinguish different scenarios during the emergency, but their accuracy has been disappointing, forecasts ignore uncertainties and less attention is given to local areas. In this study, we propose a simple Multiple Linear Regression model, optimised to use phone call data to forecast the number of daily confirmed cases. Moreover, we produce a probabilistic forecast that allows decision makers to better deal with risk. Our proposed approach outperforms ARIMA, ETS, Seasonal Naive, Prophet and a regression model without call data, evaluated by three point forecast error metrics, one prediction interval and two probabilistic forecast accuracy measures. The simplicity, interpretability and reliability of the model, obtained in a careful forecasting exercise, is a meaningful contribution to decision makers at local level who acutely need to organise resources in already strained health services. We hope that this model would serve as a building block of other forecasting efforts that on the one hand would help front-line personal and decision makers at local level, and on the other would facilitate the communication with other modelling efforts being made at the national level to improve the way we tackle this pandemic and other similar future challenges.", "According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Alzheimer's disease (AD) is identified as \"forgetfulness\" or \"dementia\", and it can be caused by spleen deficiency. Longan Aril (the aril of Dimocarpus longan Lour., LA) is a kind of Chinese medicine, and it can improve intelligence attributed to entering the spleen-meridian. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of LA on AD mice with spleen deficiency, and to understand anti-AD mechanism of LA.\nA mouse model of AD with spleen deficiency was established by D-gal (140\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) and AlCl3 (20\u00a0mg/kg, intragastrical administration) in combination with an irregular diet for 60 days, in which mice in LA group were daily given LA (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0\u00a0g/kg). The anti-AD effects of LA were evaluated by the Morris water maze, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Nissl, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. The anti-AD mechanism of LA was studied by using metabolomics, and the expressions of RAS/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by Western blotting.\nLA improved learning and memory abilities, superoxide dismutase (SOD) level, and form and number of Nissl bodies, while reduced the levels of A\u03b242, phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), histological injury, and apoptosis rate in AD group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 or P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The anti-AD mechanism of LA may be related to RAS/MEK/ERK and other signaling pathways, in which the expressions of RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathway-related proteins significantly reduced (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 or P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).\nLA could improve the cognitive ability and reduce the pathologic impairment in AD mice, which might be partly mediated via inhibition of RAS/MEK/ERK singling pathway.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to disrupt how we diagnose and treat patients. Previous work by our group has demonstrated that the majority of patients and their relatives feel comfortable with the application of AI to augment surgical care. The aim of this study was to similarly evaluate the attitudes of surgeons and the wider surgical team toward the role of AI in neurosurgery.\nIn a 2-stage cross sectional survey, an initial open-question qualitative survey was created to determine the perspective of the surgical team on AI in neurosurgery including surgeons, anesthetists, nurses, and operating room practitioners. Thematic analysis was performed to develop a second-stage quantitative survey that was distributed via social media. We assessed the extent to which they agreed and were comfortable with real-world AI implementation using a 5-point Likert scale.\nIn the first-stage survey, 33 participants responded. Six main themes were identified: imaging interpretation and preoperative diagnosis, coordination of the surgical team, operative planning, real-time alert of hazards and complications, autonomous surgery, and postoperative management and follow-up. In the second stage, 100 participants responded. Responders somewhat agreed or strongly agreed about AI being used for imaging interpretation (62%), operative planning (82%), coordination of the surgical team (70%), real-time alert of hazards and complications (85%), and autonomous surgery (66%). The role of AI within postoperative management and follow-up was less agreeable (49%).\nThis survey highlights that the majority of surgeons and the wider surgical team both agree and are comfortable with the application of AI within neurosurgery.", "The main objective of this research was to help clarify the relationship between ability emotional intelligence (AEI) and bullying in children. Bullying is a maladaptive behaviour that generates severe adverse consequences in the school environment and is a matter of growing concern in the educational community. To investigate the relationship between AEI and bullying, we administered two tests to a sample of 329 students (52.9% girls) aged between 8 and 12 years old (Mage = 9.3; SD = 1.2). AEI was assessed using a test based on the interpretation of cinema scenes (EMOCINE). EMOCINE was designed to measure two of the primary factors considered in Mayer and Salovey's ability model: emotional perception and emotional understanding. Furthermore, we administered a measure of bullying and school violence (AVE), which provides a global index of bullying, as well as a measure of its intensity, by considering eight scales or types of victimisation (harassment, intimidation, coercion, threats, social blocking, social exclusion, manipulation and aggression). The results show that age had a statistically significant effect on measures of bullying, while gender showed an interaction with victimisation types. A reduction in bullying behaviours was observed as the age of children increased, while gender-based analyses revealed different patterns in bullying behaviours. Regarding EI, it was observed that students with high AEI scores presented the lowest levels in both global bullying indexes and the victimisation types. Consequently, AEI seems to have important implications for bullying behaviours, and therefore, interventions aimed at the evaluation, training and development of AEI might offer the educational community the possibility of preventing or redirecting bullying situations.", "Visual question answering (VQA) is a multi-modal task involving natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), which requires models to understand of both visual information and textual information simultaneously to predict the correct answer for the input visual image and textual question, and has been widely used in smart and intelligent transport systems, smart city, and other fields. Today, advanced VQA approaches model dense interactions between image regions and question words by designing co-attention mechanisms to achieve better accuracy. However, modeling interactions between each image region and each question word will force the model to calculate irrelevant information, thus causing the model's attention to be distracted. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a novel model called Multi-modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks (MESAN), which concentrates the model's attention by explicitly selecting the parts of the input features that are the most relevant to answering the input question. We consider that this method based on top-k selection can reduce the interference caused by irrelevant information and ultimately help the model to achieve better performance. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset VQA v2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our best single model delivers 70.71% and 71.08% overall accuracy on the test-dev and test-std sets, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can obtain better attended features than other advanced models through attention visualization. Our work proves that the models with sparse attention mechanisms can also achieve competitive results on VQA datasets. We hope that it can promote the development of VQA models and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology related to VQA in various aspects.", "Slower and suboptimal decision making has been identified in adults with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Owing to the limited evidence on decision making in first-degree relatives, we aimed to investigate, whether alterations in decision making are present in young children at familial high risk of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.\nIn this population-based cohort study we assessed decision making in 197 children at familial high risk of schizophrenia (FHR-SZ), 115 children at familial high risk of bipolar disorder (FHR-BP), and 190 controls aged seven using the Cambridge Gambling Task. Potential associations to neurocognition, psychopathology, and the home environment were investigated.\nChildren at FHR-SZ or FHR-BP displayed intact decision making. Quality of decision making showed significant but weak cross-sectional associations to neurocognition and adequacy of the home environment. Associations to aspects of executive functions and the home environment differed across groups.\nDue to the cross-sectional nature of this study, the predictive value of efficient and inefficient decision making remains to be investigated in planned follow-up studies of this cohort.\nYoung children at FHR-SZ or FHR-BP do not differ from controls in decision making efficacy, which does not appear to be an early risk marker of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Decision making is weakly associated to neurocognition and the home environment, but not to general intelligence or psychopathology.", "To assess awareness and knowledge of Interventional Radiology (IR) in a large population of medical students in 2019.\nAn anonymous survey was distributed electronically to 9546 medical students from first to sixth year at three European medical schools. The survey contained 14 questions, including two general questions on diagnostic radiology (DR) and artificial intelligence (AI), and 11 on IR. Responses were analyzed for all students and compared between preclinical (PCs) (first to third year) and clinical phase (Cs) (fourth to sixth year) of medical school. Of 9546 students, 1459 students (15.3%) answered the survey.\nOn DR questions, 34.8% answered that AI is a threat for radiologists (PCs: 246/725 (33.9%); Cs: 248/734 (36%)) and 91.1% thought that radiology has a future (PCs: 668/725 (92.1%); Cs: 657/734 (89.5%)). On IR questions, 80.8% (1179/1459) students had already heard of IR; 75.7% (1104/1459) stated that their knowledge of IR wasn't as good as the other specialties and 80% would like more lectures on IR. Finally, 24.2% (353/1459) indicated an interest in a career in IR with a majority of women in preclinical phase, but this trend reverses in clinical phase.\nDevelopment of new technology supporting advances in artificial intelligence will likely continue to change the landscape of radiology; however, medical students remain confident in the need for specialty-trained human physicians in the future of radiology as a clinical practice. A large majority of medical students would like more information about IR in their medical curriculum; almost a quarter of students would be interested in a career in IR.", "Conditional survival (CS) provides dynamic prognostic estimates by considering the patients existing survival time. Since CS for endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is lacking, we aimed to assess the CS of endemic NPC and establish a web-based calculator to predict individualized, conditional site-specific recurrence risk.\nUsing an NPC-specific database with a big-data intelligence platform, 10,058 endemic patients with non-metastatic stage I-IVA NPC receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy between April 2009 and December 2015 were investigated. Crude CS estimates of conditional overall survival (COS), conditional disease-free survival (CDFS), conditional locoregional relapse-free survival (CLRRFS), conditional distant metastasis-free survival (CDMFS), and conditional NPC-specific survival (CNPC-SS) were calculated. Covariate-adjusted CS estimates were generated using inverse probability weighting. A prediction model was established using competing risk models and was externally validated with an independent, non-metastatic stage I-IVA NPC cohort undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (n = 601) at another institution.\nThe median follow-up of the primary cohort was 67.2 months. The 5-year COS, CDFS, CLRRFS, CDMFS, and CNPC-SS increased from 86.2%, 78.1%, 89.8%, 87.3%, and 87.6% at diagnosis to 87.3%, 87.7%, 94.4%, 96.0%, and 90.1%, respectively, for an existing survival time of 3 years since diagnosis. Differences in CS estimates between prognostic factor subgroups of each endpoint were noticeable at diagnosis but diminished with time, whereas an ever-increasing disparity in CS between different age subgroups was observed over time. Notably, the prognoses of patients that were poor at diagnosis improved greatly as patients survived longer. For individualized CS predictions, we developed a web-based model to estimate the conditional risk of local (C-index, 0.656), regional (0.667), bone (0.742), lung (0.681), and liver (0.711) recurrence, which significantly outperformed the current staging system (P < 0.001). The performance of this web-based model was further validated using an external validation cohort (median follow-up, 61.3 months), with C-indices of 0.672, 0.736, 0.754, 0.663, and 0.721, respectively.\nWe characterized the CS of endemic NPC in the largest cohort to date. Moreover, we established a web-based calculator to predict the CS of site-specific recurrence, which may help to tailor individualized, risk-based, time-adapted follow-up strategies.", "Fast learning designates the behavioral and neuronal mechanisms underlying the acquisition of a long-term memory trace after a unique and brief experience. As such it is opposed to incremental, slower reinforcement or procedural learning requiring repetitive training. This learning process, found in most animal species, exists in a large spectrum of natural behaviors, such as one-shot associative, spatial, or perceptual learning, and is a core principle of human episodic memory. We review here the neuronal and synaptic long-term changes associated with fast learning in mammals and discuss some hypotheses related to their underlying mechanisms. We first describe the variety of behavioral paradigms used to test fast learning memories: those preferentially involve a single and brief (from few hundred milliseconds to few minutes) exposures to salient stimuli, sufficient to trigger a long-lasting memory trace and new adaptive responses. We then focus on neuronal activity patterns observed during fast learning and the emergence of long-term selective responses, before documenting the physiological correlates of fast learning. In the search for the engrams of fast learning, a growing body of evidence highlights long-term changes in gene expression, structural, intrinsic, and synaptic plasticities. Finally, we discuss the potential role of the sparse and bursting nature of neuronal activity observed during the fast learning, especially in the induction plasticity mechanisms leading to the rapid establishment of long-term synaptic modifications. We conclude with more theoretical perspectives on network dynamics that could enable fast learning, with an overview of some theoretical approaches in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence.", "Different times call for different measures. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to search for alternative methods to provide an annual meeting which is equally interesting and has quality. For the Belgian Society of Radiology (BSR) 2020 Annual Meeting, the sections on Abdominal Imaging, Thoracic Imaging and the Young Radiologist Section (YRS) joined forces to organize a meeting which is quite different from the ones we have organised in the past. We have chosen to create a compact - approximately 5 hour - and entirely virtual meeting with the possibility of live interaction with the speakers during the question and answer sessions. The meeting kicks off with a message from the BSR president about radiology in 2020, followed by three abdominal talks. The second session combines an abdominal talk with COVID-related talks. We have chosen to include not only thoracic findings in COVID-19, but to take it further and discuss neurological patterns, long-term clinical findings and the progress in artificial intelligence in COVID-19. Lastly, the annual meeting closes off with a short movie about the (re)discovery of R\u00f6ntgens X-ray, presented to us by the Belgian Museum for Radiology, Military Hospital, Brussels.", "Race-based discrimination has been identified as a risk factor for psychotic-like experiences (PLE) among immigrant populations of color. Although ethnic identity is theorized to protect against the negative mental health impact of discrimination, empirical confirmation remains mixed. We posit mixed results are in part due to the omission of individual differences in trait emotional self-efficacy, which includes self-perceptions about emotional capabilities necessary to navigate in a multicultural world. Accordingly, this study assessed the interrelation between trait emotional self-efficacy, formally recognized as trait emotional intelligence or trait EI, ethnic identity, and racial discrimination in predicting PLE using a sample of racial and ethnic minority immigrant emerging adults (N = 456; Mage = 19.97). Hierarchical linear regressions indicated that discrimination and trait EI were associated with higher and lower PLE respectively, regardless of ethnic identity. Additionally, the association between ethnic identity and PLE, in the presence of discrimination, was negative and significant only among individuals with low trait EI as indicated by slope difference tests and the Johnson-Neyman method. We discuss the practical and theoretical implications of our findings.

After 1949 Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) underwent an independent and somatically oriented development. Although assumed that there was systematic injustice in inpatient facilities of child psychiatry in the GDR, no study from this period has been published to our knowledge up to now. The work presented here begins to close this gap by comparing data from 1960 with current data (2015) of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department at the Rostock Medical Center. Significant differences between results from 1960 and 2015 indicate a currently higher number of admissions, only half the length of stay, an alignment in the gender ratio, a trend towards adolescent patients, a shift away from the 1960 dominant intelligence impairment towards behavioural and emotional disorders, a higher proportion of children and adolescents treated with drugs, and more specialist follow-up treatments after the inpatient stay in 2015. We found no evidence of forced medication in 1960. The discussion also addresses the danger of a solitary development of child psychiatry away from a medical to a more social psychiatric, educational and therapeutic subject.\nZusammenfassung Die Kinderpsychiatrie unterliegt seit ihren Anf\u00e4ngen einem permanenten Wandel, der durch gesellschaftliche Ver\u00e4nderungen und damit unterschiedlichen Erwartungen an das Fach, Entwicklungen in der Diagnostik, Therapie sowie den jeweiligen Klassifikationssystemen bedingt ist. Dabei kam es insbesondere nach 1949 in der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik (DDR) zu einer eigenst\u00e4ndigen sehr somatisch gepr\u00e4gten Entwicklung. Auch wenn davon ausgegangen werden kann, dass es systematisches Unrecht in station\u00e4ren Einrichtungen der Kinderpsychiatrie der DDR gab, existiert bisher keine Studie aus dieser Zeit. Die vorgestellte Arbeit beginnt, diese Wissensl\u00fccke zu schlie\u00dfen, indem sie Daten aus dem Jahr 1960 mit aktuellen Versorgungsdaten (2015) der Rostocker universit\u00e4ren Kinderpsychiatrie vergleicht. Als signifikante Ergebnisse kristallisierten sich eine wesentlich h\u00f6here Aufnahmezahl, eine nur halb so lange Verweildauer, eine Angleichung im Verh\u00e4ltnis der Geschlechter, ein Trend hin zu jugendlichen Patienten, ein Shift weg von der 1960 dominierenden Intelligenzminderung hin zu Verhaltens- und emotionalen St\u00f6rungen, ein h\u00f6herer Anteil medikament\u00f6s behandelter Kinder und Jugendlicher sowie eine fachspezifische Weiterbehandlung nach dem station\u00e4ren Aufenthalt 2015 heraus. Anhaltspunkte f\u00fcr eine Zwangsmedikation 1960 fanden sich nicht. In der Diskussion wird auch auf die Gefahr einer solit\u00e4ren Entwicklung der Kinderpsychiatrie weg von einem medizinischen hin zu einem sozialpsychiatrisch, p\u00e4dagogisch- therapeutischem Fach eingegangen.", "There is little data on the long-term neurocognitive and educational outcomes among school-aged survivors of neonatal jaundice (NNJ) and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in Africa. This study investigates the long-term neurocognitive and educational outcomes and the correlates of these outcomes in school-aged survivors of NNJ or HIE in Kilifi, Kenya.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study on neurocognitive and educational outcomes among school-aged survivors (6-12\u2009years) of NNJ (n\u2009=\u2009134) and HIE (n\u2009=\u2009107) and compared them to a community comparison group (n\u2009=\u2009134). We assessed nonverbal intelligence, planning, working memory, attention, syntax, pragmatics, word-finding, memory, perceptual-motor, mathematical, and reading abilities. We also collected information on medical history, caregivers' mental health, and family environment.\nThe survivors of NNJ had lower mean total scores in word-finding [F (1, 250)\u2009=\u20093.89, p\u2009=\u20090.050] and memory [F (1, 248)\u2009=\u20096.74, p\u2009=\u20090.010] than the comparison group. The survivors of HIE had lower mean scores in pragmatics [F (1, 230)\u2009=\u20096.61, p\u2009=\u20090.011] and higher scores higher scores in non-verbal reasoning [F (1, 225) =4.10, p\u2009=\u20090.044] than the comparison group. Stunted growth was associated with almost all the outcomes in HIE.\nSurvivors of NNJ and HIE present with impairment in the multiple domains, which need to be taken into consideration in the planning of educational and rehabilitative services.", "Methyl mercury (MeHg) poisoning or Minamata disease (MD) from fish consumption is a public health concern throughout the world because all fish contain small amounts. The lowest exposure level needed to impair children's development is controversial. Actual poisoning with MeHg from fish consumption has been reliably reported only two times. It occurred in Minamata, Japan in the 1950s and then in Niigata, Japan in the 1960s. On each occasion, massive industrial pollution led to local fish having mercury levels as high as 40ppm. In Niigata the pollution was on the Agano River and there were over 2000 commercial fishermen active at that time. We studied adult subjects who had been exposed perinatally to MeHg from fish consumption during the Niigata poisoning to determine the long-term impact of exposure. We identified mothers with elevated levels of exposure during the epidemic and those diagnosed with MeHg poisoning. The subjects of the study were their adult children, born during the epidemic. The evaluation consisted of a questionnaire (administered by interview) focusing on development, symptoms, and current function and a standard medical and neurological examination. The subjects were divided into four groups based upon prenatal levels of mercury in maternal hair or the presence of MD. For Group A the hair mercury levels were 50ppm or more, for Group B the mercury levels were 25-49ppm, and for Group C 10-24ppm. The subjects in Group D were born to mothers diagnosed with MD, but their mercury levels were not measured. Exposure was predominantly prenatal, but some mothers also breast fed their infants. Group A included 13 subjects among whom two were diagnosed with congenital MeHg poisoning and in two others it was suspected. Group B included 10 subjects, of whom three had symptoms compatible with MeHg poisoning. Group C had nine subjects including one with intellectual deficit and another with hearing loss. Group D had eight subjects of whom four had symptoms compatible with MeHg exposure, but only one had abnormal neurological findings. Among the subjects thought to have congenital or childhood MeHg poisoning, intelligence did not appear to have declined over time. More children were affected by prenatal and postnatal MeHg exposure at Niigata than was previously reported.", "Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly being applied to the drug-design process as a result of the development of novel algorithms, growing access, the falling cost of computation and the development of novel technologies for generating chemically and biologically relevant data. There has been recent progress in fields such as molecular de novo generation, synthetic route prediction and, to some extent, property predictions. Despite this, most research in these fields has focused on improving the accuracy of the technologies, rather than on quantifying the uncertainty in the predictions. Uncertainty quantification will become a key component in autonomous decision making and will be crucial for integrating machine learning and chemistry automation to create an autonomous design-make-test-analyse cycle. This review covers the empirical, frequentist and Bayesian approaches to uncertainty quantification, and outlines how they can be used for drug design. We also outline the impact of uncertainty quantification on decision making.", "Objective:The etiology and pathophysiologic mechanism of sudden sensorineural hearing loss are undefined. We will use artificial intelligence and big data methods to explore the correlation between sudden sensorineural hearing loss and serum indices. Method:A total of 1218 patients with sudden deafness admitted to Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital were selected as the experimental group, 95 861 healthy subjects were randomly selected as the control group at the same period. Serum biochemical indexes in two groups were collected and analyzed by TreeNet and CART machine learning algorithms, to screen out highly correlated indicators with sudden sensorineural hearing loss and dig out a set of clinical features for people with high risk of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Result:It was found that high prevalence rate of sudden sensorineural hearing loss is related to eosinophils, reticulocyte and fibrinogen. The areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves\uff08ROC-AUC\uff09 were exploited to evaluate the prediction performance of TreeNet model. Overall the TreeNet model has provided high predictive ability by ROC curve, achieving AUC of 0.99, both recall and accuracy rate of 99.90%. Conclusion:There is significant difference between sudden deadness and normal people in serum biochemical indexes. Eosinophil is the first important indicator to distinguish sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Treenet model has important referenced significance for the screening and diagnosis of sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u8ba8\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u804b\u4e0e\u8840\u6e05\u751f\u5316\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9009\u53d6\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u804b\u60a3\u80051218\u4f8b\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ec4\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u540c\u671f\u63a5\u53d7\u5065\u5eb7\u4f53\u68c0\u800595 861\u4f8b\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e24\u7ec4\u76ee\u6807\u4eba\u7fa4\u8840\u6e05\u751f\u5316\u7b49\u68c0\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7TreeNet\u548cCART\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u4e0e\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u804b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6316\u6398\u51fa\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u804b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7279\u5f81\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7TreeNet\u3001CART\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u804b\u7684\u53d1\u75c5\u4e0e\u55dc\u9178\u7c92\u7ec6\u80de\u3001\u7f51\u7ec7\u7ea2\u7ec6\u80de\u548c\u7ea4\u7ef4\u86cb\u767d\u539f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7ecfROC\u66f2\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30TreeNet\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dAUC=0.99\uff0c\u67e5\u5168\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5747\u4e3a99.90%\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u804b\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8840\u6e05\u751f\u5316\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8ddf\u6b63\u5e38\u4eba\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u55dc\u9178\u7c92\u7ec6\u80de\u662f\u533a\u5206\u662f\u5426\u60a3\u6709\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u804b\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u6807\uff0cTreeNet\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7a81\u53d1\u6027\u804b\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u610f\u4e49\u3002.", "For the growing patient population with congenital heart disease (CHD), improving clinical workflow, accuracy of diagnosis, and efficiency of analyses are considered unmet clinical needs. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging offers non-invasive and non-ionizing assessment of CHD patients. However, although CMR data facilitates reliable analysis of cardiac function and anatomy, clinical workflow mostly relies on manual analysis of CMR images, which is time consuming. Thus, an automated and accurate segmentation platform exclusively dedicated to pediatric CMR images can significantly improve the clinical workflow, as the present work aims to establish.\nTraining artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for CMR analysis requires large annotated datasets, which are not readily available for pediatric subjects and particularly in CHD patients. To mitigate this issue, we devised a novel method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthetically augment the training dataset via generating synthetic CMR images and their corresponding chamber segmentations. In addition, we trained and validated a deep fully convolutional network (FCN) on a dataset, consisting of [Formula: see text] pediatric subjects with complex CHD, which we made publicly available. Dice metric, Jaccard index and Hausdorff distance as well as clinically-relevant volumetric indices are reported to assess and compare our platform with other algorithms including U-Net and cvi42, which is used in clinics.\nFor congenital CMR dataset, our FCN model yields an average Dice metric of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for LV at end-diastole and end-systole, respectively, and [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for RV at end-diastole and end-systole, respectively. Using the same dataset, the cvi42, resulted in [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for LV and RV at end-diastole and end-systole, and the U-Net architecture resulted in [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] for LV and RV at end-diastole and end-systole, respectively.\nThe chambers' segmentation results from our fully-automated method showed strong agreement with manual segmentation and no significant statistical difference was found by two independent statistical analyses. Whereas cvi42 and U-Net segmentation results failed to pass the t-test. Relying on these outcomes, it can be inferred that by taking advantage of GANs, our method is clinically relevant and can be used for pediatric and congenital CMR segmentation and analysis.", "A major obstacle for the effective treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is its molecular heterogeneity, reflected by the diverse clinical outcomes and responses to therapies that occur. The tumors of patients with PDAC must therefore be closely examined and classified before treatment initiation in order to predict the natural evolution of the disease and the response to therapy. To stratify patients, it is absolutely necessary to identify biological markers that are highly specific and reproducible, and easily measurable by inexpensive sensitive techniques. Several promising strategies to find biomarkers are already available or under development, such as the use of liquid biopsies to detect circulating tumor cells, circulating free DNA, methylated DNA, circulating RNA, and exosomes and extracellular vesicles, as well as immunological markers and molecular markers. Such biomarkers are capable of classifying patients with PDAC and predicting their therapeutic sensitivity. Interestingly, developing chemograms using primary cell lines or organoids and analyzing the resulting high-throughput data via artificial intelligence would be highly beneficial to patients. How can exploiting these biomarkers benefit patients with resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, and metastatic PDAC? In fact, the utility of these biomarkers depends on the patient's clinical situation. At the early stages of the disease, the clinician's priority lies in rapid diagnosis, so that the patient receives surgery without delay; at advanced disease stages, where therapeutic possibilities are severely limited, the priority is to determine the PDAC tumor subtype so as to estimate the clinical outcome and select a suitable effective treatment.", "The COVID-19 crisis and consequent confinement restrictions have caused significant psychosocial stress and reports of sleep complaints, which require early management, have increased during recent months. To help individuals concerned about their sleep, we developed a smartphone-based app called KANOPEE that allows users to interact with a virtual agent dedicated to autonomous screening and delivering digital behavioral interventions.\nOur objective was to assess the feasibility of this app, in terms of inclusion rate, follow-up rate, perceived trust and acceptance of the virtual agent, and effects of the intervention program, in the context of COVID-19 confinement in France.\nThe virtual agent is an artificial intelligence program using decision tree architecture and interacting through natural body motion and natural voice. A total of 2069 users aged 18 years and above downloaded the free app during the study period (April 22 to May 5, 2020). These users first completed a screening interview based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) conducted by the virtual agent. If the users were positive for insomnia complaints (ISI score >14), they were eligible to join the 2-stage intervention program: (1) complete an electronic sleep diary for 1 week and (2) follow personalized sleep recommendations for 10 days. We collected and analyzed the following measures: sociodemographic information, ISI scores and sleep/wake schedules, and acceptance and trust of the agent.\nApproximately 76% (1574/2069) of the app users completed the screening interview with the virtual agent. The virtual agent was well accepted by 27.4% (431/1574) of the users who answered the acceptance and trust questionnaires on its usability, satisfaction, benevolence, and credibility. Of the 773 screened users who reported sleep complaints (ISI score >14), 166 (21.5%) followed Step 1 of the intervention, and only 47 of those (28.3%) followed Step 2. Users who completed Step 1 found that their insomnia complaints (baseline mean ISI score 18.56, mean ISI score after Step 1 15.99; P<.001) and nocturnal sleep quality improved significantly after 1 week. Users who completed Step 2 also showed an improvement compared to the initial measures (baseline mean ISI score 18.87, mean ISI score after Step 2 14.68; P<.001). Users that were most severely affected (ISI score >21) did not respond to either intervention.\nThese preliminary results suggest that the KANOPEE app is a promising solution to screen populations for sleep complaints and that it provides acceptable and practical behavioral advice for individuals reporting moderately severe insomnia.", "Introduction: Although there is a need for rehabilitation treatment with the increase in the aging population, the shortage of skilled physicians frustrates this necessity. Robotic technology has been advocated as one of the most viable methods with the potential to replace humans in providing physical rehabilitation of patients with neurological impairment. However, because the pioneering robot devices suffer several reservations such as safety and comfort concerns in clinical practice, there is an urgent need to provide upgraded replacements. The rapid development of intelligent computing has attracted the attention of researchers concerning the utilization of computational intelligence algorithms for robots in rehabilitation. Areas covered: This article reviews the state of the art and advances of robotic neurorehabilitation with computational intelligence. We classified advances into two categories: mechanical structures and control methods. Prospective outlooks of rehabilitation robots also have been discussed. Expert opinion: The aggravation of global aging has promoted the application of robotic technology in neurorehabilitation. However, this approach is not mature enough to guarantee the safety of patients. Our critical review summarizes multiple computation algorithms which have been proved to be valuable for better robotic use in clinical settings and guide the possible future advances in this industry.", "The situation of an off-center casing under non-uniform ground stress can occur in the process of drilling a salt-gypsum formation, and the related casing stress calculation has not yet been solved analytically. In addition, the experimental equipment in many cases cannot meet the actual conditions and the experimental cost is very high. These comprehensive factors cause the existing casing design to not meet the actual conditions and cause casing deformation, affecting the drilling operation in Tarim oil field. The finite element method is the only effective method to solve this problem at present, but the re-modelling process is time-consuming because of the changes in the parameters, such as the cement properties, casing centrality, and the casing size. In this article, an artificial intelligence method based on support vector machine (SVM) to predict the maximum stress of an off-center casing under non-uniform ground stress has been proposed. After a program based on a radial basis function (RBF)-support vector regression (SVR) (\u03b5-SVR) model was established and validated, we constructed a data sample with a capacity of 120 by using the finite element method, which could meet the demand of the nine-factor \u03b5-SVR model to predict the maximum stress of the casing. The results showed that the artificial intelligence prediction method proposed in this manuscript had satisfactory prediction accuracy and could be effectively used to predict the maximum stress of an off-center casing under complex downhole conditions.\nSupplementary material is available for this article at 10.1007/s11431-019-1694-4 and is accessible for authorized users.", "To what extent do characteristics of germline genome editing (GGE) determine whether the general public supports permitting the clinical use of GGE?\nThe risk that GGE would cause congenital abnormalities had the largest effect on support for allowing GGE, followed by effectiveness of GGE, while costs, the type of application (disease or enhancement) and the effect on child well-being had moderate effects.\nScientific progress on GGE has increased the urgency of resolving whether and when clinical application of GGE may be ethically acceptable. Various expert bodies have suggested that the treatment characteristics will be key in determining whether GGE is acceptable. For example, GGE with substantial risks (e.g. 15% chance of a major congenital abnormality) may be acceptable to prevent a severe disease but not to enhance non-medical characteristics or traits of an otherwise healthy embryo (e.g. eye colour or perhaps in the future more complex traits, such as intelligence). While experts have called for public engagement, it is unclear whether and how much the public acceptability of GGE is affected by the treatment characteristics proposed by experts.\nThe vignette-based survey was disseminated in 2018 among 1857 members of the Dutch general public. An online research panel was used to recruit a sample representing the adult Dutch general public.\nA literature review identified the key treatment characteristics of GGE: the effect on the well-being of the future child, use for disease or enhancement, risks for the future child, effectiveness (here defined as the chance of a live birth, assuming that if the GGE was not successful, the embryo would not be transferred), cost and availability of alternative treatments/procedures to prevent the genetic disease or provide enhancement (i.e. preimplantation genetic testing (PGT)), respectively. For each treatment characteristic, 2-3 levels were defined to realistically represent GGE and its current alternatives, donor gametes and ICSI with PGT. Twelve vignettes were created by fractional factorial design. A multinominal logit model assessed how much each treatment characteristic affected participants' choices.\nThe 1136 respondents (response rate 61%) were representative of the Dutch adult population in several demographics. Respondents were between 18 and 89 years of age. When no alternative treatment/procedure is available, the risk that GGE would cause (other) congenital abnormalities had the largest effect on whether the Dutch public supported allowing GGE (coefficient = -3.07), followed by effectiveness (coefficient\u2009=\u20092.03). Costs (covered by national insurance, coefficient = -1.14), the type of application (disease or enhancement; coefficient = -1.07), and the effect on child well-being (coefficient\u2009=\u20090.97) had similar effects on whether GGE should be allowed. If an alternative treatment/procedure (e.g. PGT) was available, participants were not categorically opposed to GGE, however, they were strongly opposed to using GGE for enhancement (coefficient = -3.37). The general acceptability of GGE was higher than participants' willingness to personally use it (P\u2009<\u20090.001). When participants considered whether they would personally use GGE, the type of application (disease or enhancement) was more important, whereas effectiveness and costs (covered by national insurance) were less important than when they considered whether GGE should be allowed. Participants who were male, younger and had lower incomes were more likely to allow GGE when no alternative treatment/procedure is available.\nSome (e.g. ethnic, religious) minorities were not well represented. To limit complexity, not all characteristics of GGE could be included (e.g. out-of-pocket costs), therefore, the views gathered from the vignettes reflect only the choices presented to the respondents. The non-included characteristics could be connected to and alter the importance of the studied characteristics. This would affect how closely the reported coefficients reflect 'real-life' importance.\nThis study is the first to quantify the substantial impact of GGE's effectiveness, costs (covered by national insurance), and effect on child well-being on whether the public considered GGE acceptable. In general, the participants were strikingly risk-averse, in that they weighed the risks of GGE more heavily than its benefits. Furthermore, although only a single study in one country, the results suggests that-if sufficiently safe and effective-the public may approve of using GGE (presumably combined with PGT) instead of solely PGT to prevent passing on a disease. The reported public views can serve as input for future consideration of the ethics and governance of GGE.\nYoung Academy of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences (UPS/RB/745), Alliance Grant of the Amsterdam Reproduction and Development Research Institute (2017-170116) and National Institutes of Health Intramural Research Programme.

New software with a decision support system was developed for manual labeling of the dataset. A total of 26 points were marked on each radiograph. The CVM stages were saved on the basis of the final decision of the observer. Fifty-four image features were saved in text format. A new subset of 72 radiographs was created according to the classification result, and these 72 radiographs were visually evaluated by 4 observers. Weighted kappa (w\u03ba) and Cohen's kappa (c\u03ba) coefficients and percentage agreement were calculated to evaluate the compatibility of the results.\nIntraobserver agreement ranges were as follows: w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.92-0.98, c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.65-0.85, and 70.8%-87.5%. Interobserver agreement ranges were as follows: w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.76-0.92, c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.4-0.65, and 50%-72.2%. Agreement between the ANN model and observers 1, 2, 3, and 4 were as follows: w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.85 (c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 59.7%), w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.8 (c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.4, 50%), w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.87 (c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 62.5%), and w\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.91 (c\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.53, 61.1%), respectively (P\u00a0<0.001). An average of 58.3% agreement was observed between the ANN model and the human observers.\nThis\u00a0study demonstrated that the developed ANN model performed close to, if not better than, human observers in CVM analysis. By generating new algorithms, automatic classification of CVM with artificial intelligence may replace conventional evaluation methods used in the future.", "The increasing demand for new therapies and other clinical interventions has made researchers conduct many clinical trials. The high level of evidence generated by clinical trials makes them the main approach to evaluating new clinical interventions. The increasing amounts of data to be considered in the planning and conducting of clinical trials has led to higher costs and increased timelines of clinical trials, with low productivity. Advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and the internet of things offer an opportunity to improve the efficiency and productivity of clinical trials at various stages. Although researchers have done some tangible work regarding the application of advanced technologies in clinical trials, the studies are yet to be mapped to give a general picture of the current state of research. This systematic mapping study was conducted to identify and analyze studies published on the role of advanced technologies in clinical trials. A search restricted to the period between 2010 and 2020 yielded a total of 443 articles. The analysis revealed a trend of increasing research interests in the area over the years. Recruitment and eligibility aspects were the main focus of the studies. The main research types were validation and evaluation studies. Most studies contributed methods and theories, hence there exists a gap for architecture, process, and metric contributions. In the future, more empirical studies are expected given the increasing interest to implement the AI, ML, DL, and IoT in clinical trials.", "Medicine is at a disciplinary crossroads. With the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare field the future care of our patients will depend on the decisions we make now. Demographic healthcare inequalities continue to persist worldwide and the impact of medical biases on different patient groups is still being uncovered by the research community. At a time when clinical AI systems are scaled up in response to the Covid19 pandemic, the role of AI in exacerbating health disparities must be critically reviewed. For AI to account for the past and build a better future, we must first unpack the present and create a new baseline on which to develop these tools. The means by which we move forwards will determine whether we project existing inequity into the future, or whether we reflect on what we hold to be true and challenge ourselves to be better. AI is an opportunity and a mirror for all disciplines to improve their impact on society and for medicine the stakes could not be higher.", "3M syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by severe growth retardation, dysmorphic facial features, skeletal dysplasia, and normal intelligence. Variants in CUL7, OBSL1, and CCDC8 genes have been reported to be responsible for this syndrome. In this study, the clinical and molecular findings of four 3M syndrome cases from three families are presented. All cases had growth retardation, relative macrocephaly, and typical dysmorphic facial features. Their neurological developments were normal. Sequencing of CUL7, OBSL1, and CCDC8 genes revealed two different novel homozygous variants in CUL7 in Families 1 and 3 and a previously reported homozygous pathogenic variant in OBSL1 in Family 2. In conclusion, a comprehensive dysmorphological evaluation should be obtained in individuals presenting with short stature and in such individuals with typical facial and skeletal findings, 3M syndrome should be considered. Our report expands the genotype of 3M syndrome and emphasizes the importance of thorough physical and dysmorphological examination.", "Objective: Mechanical retrieval of thrombotic material from acute ischemic stroke patients provides a unique entry point for translational research investigations. Here, we resolved the proteomes of cardioembolic and atherothrombotic cerebrovascular human thrombi and applied an artificial intelligence routine to examine protein signatures between the two selected groups. Methods: We specifically used n = 32 cardioembolic and n = 28 atherothrombotic diagnosed thrombi from patients suffering from acute stroke and treated by mechanical thrombectomy. Thrombi proteins were successfully separated by gel-electrophoresis. For each thrombi, peptide samples were analyzed by nano-flow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS) to obtain specific proteomes. Relative protein quantification was performed using a label-free LFQ algorithm and all dataset were analyzed using a support-vector-machine (SVM) learning method. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD020398. Clinical data were also analyzed using SVM, alone or in combination with the proteomes. Results: A total of 2,455 proteins were identified by nano-LC-MS/MS in the samples analyzed, with 438 proteins constantly detected in all samples. SVM analysis of LFQ proteomic data delivered combinations of three proteins achieving a maximum of 88.3% for correct classification of the cardioembolic and atherothrombotic samples in our cohort. The coagulation factor XIII appeared in all of the SVM protein trios, associating with cardioembolic thrombi. A combined SVM analysis of the LFQ proteome and clinical data did not deliver a better discriminatory score as compared to the proteome only. Conclusion: Our results advance the portrayal of the human cerebrovascular thrombi proteome. The exploratory SVM analysis outlined sets of proteins for a proof-of-principle characterization of our cohort cardioembolic and atherothrombotic samples. The integrated analysis proposed herein could be further developed and retested on a larger patients population to better understand stroke origin and the associated cerebrovascular pathophysiology.", "Timely detection and diagnosis are essentially needed to guide outbreak measures and infection control. It is vital to improve healthcare quality in public places, markets, schools and airports and provide useful insights into the technological environment and help researchers acknowledge the choices and gaps available in this field. In this narrative review, the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) technologies is summarized and discussed with a comparison between them from several aspects to arrive at an accurate decision on the feasibility of applying the best of these techniques in the biosensors that operate using laser detection technology. The collection of data in this analysis was done by using six reliable academic databases, namely, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and PubMed. This review includes an analysis review of three highlights: evaluating the hazard of pandemic COVID-19 transmission styles and comparing them with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) to identify the main causes of the virus spreading, a critical analysis to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on artificial intelligence using CT scans and CXR images and types of biosensors. Finally, we select the best methods that can potentially stop the propagation of the coronavirus pandemic.", "Technology has been integrated into every facet of human life, and whether it is completely advantageous remains unknown, but one thing is for sure; we are dependent on technology. Medical advances from the integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and augmented realities are widespread and have helped countless patients. Much of the advanced technology utilized by medical providers today has been borrowed and extrapolated from other industries. There remains no great collaboration between providers and engineers, which may be why medicine is only in its infancy of innovation with regards to advanced technologic integration. The purpose of this narrative review is to highlight the different technologies currently being utilized in a variety of medical specialties. Furthermore, we hope that by bringing attention to one shortcoming of the medical community, we may inspire future innovators to seek collaboration outside of the purely medical community for the betterment of all patients seeking care.", "The accumulation of methylmercury (MeHg) in rice is an important MeHg exposure pathway in humans in several mercury (Hg)-contaminated areas. In this study, the effects of low-dose biochar (BC) amendment (0.3%, w/w) on MeHg mobility/phytoavailability in different Hg-contaminated paddy soils, MeHg accumulation in rice plants and the health risks associated with MeHg-laden rice consumption were investigated. Soils amended with different doses of bamboo-derived BC (0.3, 0.5, and 1%, w/w) were incubated under anoxic conditions in microcosm experiments. In addition, pot experiments were conducted involving rice cultivation with a low BC application rate (0.3%, w/w). We observed that (1) the fraction of extractable MeHg in soils decreased with BC addition in both the microcosm and pot experiments; (2) MeHg concentrations in the rice grains (brown rice) significantly decreased by 56-88% in response to BC amendment, which may be attributed mainly to decreases in MeHg mobility/phytoavailability in the soil; and (3) the hazard quotient (HQ) values for adults and children and fetal intelligence quotient (IQ) decrements associated with MeHg-laden rice consumption were significantly alleviated under BC amendment. Taken together, our findings suggest that a low dose of BC (0.3%, w/w) could have great potential for mitigating the health risks of dietary MeHg exposure from the consumption of rice grown in mercury (Hg)-contaminated areas.", "The DRG-\u00d6RG IRP (Deutsche R\u00f6ntgengesellschaft-\u00d6sterreichische R\u00f6ntgengesellschaft international radiomics platform) represents a web-/cloud-based radiomics platform based on a public-private partnership.\u200aIt offers the possibility of data sharing, annotation, validation and certification in the field of artificial intelligence, radiomics analysis, and integrated diagnostics. In a first proof-of-concept study, automated myocardial segmentation and automated myocardial late gadolinum enhancement (LGE) detection using radiomic image features will be evaluated for myocarditis data sets.\nThe DRG-\u00d6RP IRP can be used to create quality-assured, structured image data in combination with clinical data and subsequent integrated data analysis and is characterized by the following performance criteria: Possibility of using multicentric networked data, automatically calculated quality parameters, processing of annotation tasks, contour recognition using conventional and artificial intelligence methods and the possibility of targeted integration of algorithms. In a first study, a neural network pre-trained using cardiac CINE data sets was evaluated for segmentation of PSIR data sets. In a second step, radiomic features were applied for segmental detection of LGE of the same data sets, which were provided multicenter via the IRP.\nFirst results show the advantages (data transparency, reliability, broad involvement of all members, continuous evolution as well as validation and certification) of this platform-based approach. In the proof-of-concept study, the neural network demonstrated a Dice coefficient of 0.813 compared to the expert's segmentation of the myocardium. In the segment-based myocardial LGE detection, the AUC was 0.73 and 0.79 after exclusion of segments with uncertain annotation.The evaluation and provision of the data takes place at the IRP, taking into account the FAT (fairness, accountability, transparency) and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) criteria.\nIt could be shown that the DRG-\u00d6RP IRP can be used as a crystallization point for the generation of further individual and joint projects. The execution of quantitative analyses with artificial intelligence methods is greatly facilitated by the platform approach of the DRG-\u00d6RP IRP, since pre-trained neural networks can be integrated and scientific groups can be networked.In a first proof-of-concept study on automated segmentation of the myocardium and automated myocardial LGE detection, these advantages were successfully applied.Our study shows that with the DRG-\u00d6RP IRP, strategic goals can be implemented in an interdisciplinary way, that concrete proof-of-concept examples can be demonstrated, and that a large number of individual and joint projects can be realized in a participatory way involving all groups.\n\u00b7 The DRG-\u00d6RG IRP is a web/cloud-based radiomics platform based on a public-private partnership.. \u00b7 The DRG-\u00d6RG IRP can be used for the creation of quality-assured, structured image data in combination with clinical data and subsequent integrated data analysis.. \u00b7 First results show the applicability of left ventricular myocardial segmentation using a neural network and segment-based LGE detection using radiomic image features.. \u00b7 The DRG-\u00d6RG IRP offers the possibility of integrating pre-trained neural networks and networking of scientific groups..\n\u00b7 Overhoff D, Kohlmann P, Frydrychowicz A et\u200aal.

AI is capable of completing a spectrum of mundane to complex medically oriented tasks previously performed only by boarded physicians, most recently assisting with the detection of cancers difficult to find on histopathology slides. Although computers will likely not replace pathologists any time soon, properly designed AI-based tools hold great potential for increasing workflow efficiency and diagnostic accuracy in pathology. Recent trends, such as data augmentation, crowdsourcing for generating annotated data sets, and unsupervised learning with molecular and/or clinical outcomes versus human diagnoses as a source of ground truth, are eliminating the direct role of pathologists in algorithm development. Proper integration of AI-based systems into anatomic-pathology practice will necessarily require fully digital imaging platforms, an overhaul of legacy information-technology infrastructures, modification of laboratory/pathologist workflows, appropriate reimbursement/cost-offsetting models, and ultimately, the active participation of pathologists to encourage buy-in and oversight. Regulations tailored to the nature and limitations of AI are currently in development and, when instituted, are expected to promote safe and effective use. This review addresses the challenges in AI development, deployment, and regulation to be overcome prior to its widespread adoption in anatomic pathology.", "Growth faltering in early childhood is associated with poor human capital attainment, but associations of linear growth in childhood with executive and socioemotional functioning in adulthood are understudied.\nIn a Guatemalan cohort, we identified distinct trajectories of linear growth in early childhood, assessed their predictors, and examined associations between growth trajectories and neurodevelopmental outcomes in adulthood. We also assessed the mediating role of schooling on the association of growth trajectories with adult cognitive outcomes.\nIn 2017-2019, we prospectively followed 1499 Guatemalan adults who participated in a food supplementation trial in early childhood (1969-1977). We derived height-for-age sex-specific growth trajectories from birth to 84 mo using latent class growth analysis.\nWe identified 3 growth trajectories (low, intermediate, high) with parallel slopes and intercepts already differentiated at birth in both sexes. Children of taller mothers were more likely to belong to the high and intermediate trajectories [relative risk ratio (RRR): 1.21; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.26, and RRR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.15, per 1-cm increase in height, respectively] compared with the low trajectory. Children in the wealthiest compared with the poorest socioeconomic tertile were more likely to belong to the high trajectory compared with the low trajectory (RRR: 2.24; 95% CI: 1.29, 3.88). In males, membership in the high compared with low trajectory was positively associated with nonverbal fluid intelligence, working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility at ages 40-57 y. Sex-adjusted results showed that membership in the high compared with low trajectory was positively associated with meaning and purpose scores at ages 40-57 y. Associations of intermediate compared with low growth trajectories with study outcomes were also positive but of lesser magnitude. Schooling partially mediated the associations between high and intermediate growth trajectories and measures of cognitive ability in adulthood.\nModifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors predicted growth throughout childhood. Membership in the high and intermediate growth trajectories was positively associated with adult cognitive and socioemotional functioning.", "Parkinson's disease (PD) management requires the involvement of movement disorders experts, other medical specialists, and allied health professionals. Traditionally, multispecialty care has been implemented in the form of a multidisciplinary center, with an inconsistent clinical benefit and health economic impact. With the current capabilities of digital technologies, multispecialty care can be reshaped to reach a broader community of people with PD in their home and community. Digital technologies have the potential to connect patients with the care team beyond the traditional sparse clinical visit, fostering care continuity and accessibility. For example, video conferencing systems can enable the remote delivery of multispecialty care. With big data analyses, wearable and non-wearable technologies using artificial intelligence can enable the remote assessment of patients' conditions in their natural home environment, promoting a more comprehensive clinical evaluation and empowering patients to monitor their disease. These advances have been defined as technology-enabled care (TEC). We present examples of TEC under development and describe the potential challenges to achieve a full integration of technology to address complex care needs in PD.", "Autistic individuals often experience difficulties in social settings. Although autistic individuals may not intuitively know the \"typical\" way to behave in social settings, many autistic individuals have a desire to fit in so they develop techniques to \"camouflage\" their autistic traits. Although camouflaging may help individuals to navigate social environments, camouflaging has also been shown to produce negative psychological outcomes. This study aims to explore whether this \"camouflaging\" strategy is associated with poor social competence, an aspect of the autism diagnosis.\nIn this study, 247 nonautistic adults completed the Multidimensional Social Competence Scale (MSCS) to assess their social competence, and the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) to assess the extent to which they used strategies to compensate or mask behaviors characteristic of autism in social settings.\nWe found that over and above IQ, gender, and executive functioning scores, social competence (MSCS) scores reliably predicted the extent to which nonautistic individuals camouflaged, accounting for 25% of the variance in CAT-Q scores. Importantly, even when autistic traits were controlled for, social competence was still able to account for additional variance in CAT-Q scores.\nThese results suggest that low social competency in nonautistic adults predicts camouflaging as a strategy in social situations. Given these camouflaging behaviors are being performed in an attempt to comply with an environmental demand to behave in a particular manner, these results also highlight the importance of conceptualizing the social challenges that autistic and nonautistic individuals face in a bidirectional manner, where the onus is not solely on the individual to comply with social conventions but also on society to accommodate diverse behavioral traits.\nWhy was this study done?: Some autistic individuals try to hide their autistic traits to \"fit in\" with others, referred to as \"camouflaging.\" Nonautistic adults also report camouflaging, but it is unclear whether this camouflaging is related to social difficulties that are not specific to autism. No research has been conducted to examine the relationship between social competence and camouflaging in nonautistic adults.What was the purpose of this study?: To further understand the factors that are related to camouflaging behaviors. More specifically, whether social abilities, and/or autism characteristics, are related to whether nonautistic adults camouflage.What did the researchers do?: We had 257 nonautistic adults complete various questionnaires, including ones that asked them about their camouflaging behaviors and social abilities. We examined the relationships between the scores from these questionnaires and the influence of other factors such as gender, intelligence, and executive functioning.What were the results of the study?: We found that both social abilities and autistic traits were related to camouflaging behaviors. Indeed, nonautistic adults who had poor social skills, and more autistic traits, engaged in more camouflaging. Social skills were associated with camouflaging even after we considered factors such as gender, intelligence, and executive functioning.What do these findings add to what was already known?: These findings help us understand camouflaging by demonstrating that it may be a common response to social difficulties in nonautistic, as well as autistic, adults. These results also indicate that camouflaging is related to low social competency, not just autism characteristics.What are the potential weaknesses in the study?: The participants in our study completed questionnaires through which they were required to pick from set answers, rather than describe their experiences. We may be missing important qualitative differences in the way nonautistic adults camouflage compared with autistic adults.How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future?: By comparing what is shared and what is unique with nonautistic people who share traits with autistic people, a more precise definition and study of camouflaging behavior are possible. Rather than see camouflaging as a phenomenon that occurs exclusively in autistic people because of their disability, it may be that both autistic and nonautistic people use camouflaging when they perceive themselves to lack the necessary social competencies that are expected within their social contexts. Because both autistic traits and social competency are related to camouflaging behavior, we can begin to think about how to tease apart which characteristics are more likely to evoke camouflaging in autistic individuals and how this may be similar or different in nonautistic individuals. This knowledge will ultimately contribute to the development of more tailored approaches to prevent and/or reduce the negative impact of camouflaging behaviors for autistic adults.", "In severe stroke patients, considerable concern should be given to toileting activity in rehabilitative support. Recently, the application of artificial intelligence, including machine learning (ML), has expanded into the stroke medical field, which could clarify the factors affecting toileting independence in severe stroke patients. This study aimed to identify the factors affecting toileting independence in severe stroke patients using ML.\nWe used the Japan Rehabilitation Database from 2005 to 2015 to investigate data from 2292 severe stroke patients. We performed the chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) algorithm with various explanatory variables.\nThe CHAID model identified modified Rankin scale (mRS) score as the first discriminator. Among those with an mRS score \u22644, the next discriminator was age (score \u226472, 73-80, or >80). Among those with an mRS score > 4, the next discriminator was also age (score \u226457, 58-72, 73-80, or >80). Interestingly, some patients achieved toileting independence, although this study focused on severe stroke patients. In branches based on age, the percentage of the patients who achieved toileting independence at discharge decreased progressively with age.\nWe identified the influential factors, including reference values, for achieving toileting independence in convalescent severe stroke patients.", "How do we scale biological science to the demand of next generation biology and medicine to keep track of the facts, predictions, and hypotheses? These days, enormous amounts of DNA sequence and other omics data are generated. Since these data contain the blueprint for life, it is imperative that we interpret it accurately. The abundance of DNA is only one part of the challenge. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and network methods routinely build on large screens, single cell technologies, proteomics, and other modalities to infer or predict biological functions and phenotypes associated with proteins, pathways, and organisms. As a first step, how do we systematically trace the provenance of knowledge from experimental ground truth to gene function predictions and annotations? Here, we review the main challenges in tracking the evolution of biological knowledge and propose several specific solutions to provenance and computational tracing of evidence in functional linkage networks.", "Objective: To establish an artificial intelligence burn depth recognition model based on convolutional neural network, and to test its effectiveness. Methods: In this evaluation study on diagnostic test, 484 wound photos of 221 burn patients in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (hereinafter referred to as the author's unit) from January 2010 to December 2019 taken within 48 hours after injury which met the inclusion criteria were collected and numbered randomly. The target wounds were delineated by image viewing software, and the burn depth was judged by 3 attending doctors with more than 5-year professional experience in Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery of the author's unit. After marking the superficial partial-thickness burn, deep partial-thickness burn, or full-thickness burn in different colors, the burn wounds were cut according to 224\u00d7224 pixels to obtain 5 637 complete wound images. The image data generator was used to expand images of each burn depth to 10 000 images, after which, images of each burn depth were divided into training set, verification set, and test set according to the ratio of 7.0\u22361.5\u22361.5. Under Keras 2.2.4 Python 2.8.0 version, the residual network ResNet-50 of convolutional neural network was used to establish the artificial intelligence burn depth recognition model. The training set was input for training, and the verification set was used to adjust and optimize the model. The judging accuracy rate of various burn depths by the established model was tested by the test set, and precision, recall, and F1_score were calculated. The test results were visualized to generate two-dimensional tSNE cloud chart through the dimensionality reduction tool tSNE, and the distribution of various burn depths was observed. According to the sensitivity and specificity of the model for the recognition of 3 kinds of burn depths, the corresponding receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve was drawn, and the area under the ROC curve was calculated. Results: (1) After the testing of the test set, the precisions of the artificial intelligence burn depth recognition model for the recognition of superficial partial-thickness burn, deep partial-thickness burn, or full-thickness burn were 84% (1 095/1 301), 81% (1 215/1 499) and 82% (1 395/1 700) respectively, the recall were 73% (1 095/1 500), 81% (1 215/1 500) and 93% (1 395/1 500) respectively, and the F1_scores were 0.78, 0.81, and 0.87 respectively. (2) tSNE cloud chart showed that there was small overlapping among different burn depths in the test results for the test set of artificial intelligence burn depth recognition model, among which the overlapping between superficial partial-thickness burn and deep partial-thickness burn and that between deep partial-thickness burn and full-thickness burn were relatively more, while the overlapping between superficial partial-thickness burn and full-thickness burn was relatively less. (3) The area under the ROC curve for 3 kinds of burn depths recognized by the artificial intelligence burn depth recognition model was \u22650.94. Conclusions: The artificial intelligence burn depth recognition model established by ResNet-50 network can rather accurately identify the burn depth in the early wound photos of burn patients, especially superficial partial-thickness burn and full-thickness burn. It is expected to be used clinically to assist the diagnosis of burn depth and improve the diagnostic accuracy.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u5728\u672c\u8bca\u65ad\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u4e2d\u5357\u5927\u5b66\u6e58\u96c5\u533b\u9662(\u4e0b\u79f0\u7b14\u8005\u5355\u4f4d)2010\u5e741\u6708\u20142019\u5e7412\u6708\u6536\u6cbb\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u5165\u9009\u6807\u51c6\u7684221\u4f8b\u70e7\u4f24\u60a3\u8005\u4f24\u540e48 h\u5185\u521b\u9762\u7167\u7247484\u5f20\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6570\u5b57\u7f16\u53f7\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u67e5\u770b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5708\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u521b\u9762\uff0c\u7531\u7b14\u8005\u5355\u4f4d\u70e7\u4f24\u6574\u5f62\u79d13\u540d\u5177\u67095\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e13\u79d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u4e3b\u6cbb\u533b\u5e08\u5224\u65ad\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u989c\u8272\u6807\u8bb0\u6d45\u2161\u5ea6\u3001\u6df1\u2161\u5ea6\u6216\u2162\u5ea6\u70e7\u4f24\u540e\uff0c\u6309224\u00d7224\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5207\u5272\u5f97\u5230\u5b8c\u6574\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u57575 637\u5f20\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u7247\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5c063\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u70e7\u4f24\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5747\u6269\u5145\u81f310 000\u5f20\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u79cd\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u63097.0\u22361.5\u22361.5\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5206\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3002\u5728Keras 2.2.4 Python 2.8.0\u7248\u672c\u4e0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f51\u7edcResNet-50\u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u5404\u7c7b\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u53caF1\u6307\u6570\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u7ef4\u5de5\u5177tSNE\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u964d\u7ef4\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e8c\u7ef4tSNE\u4e91\u56fe\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5404\u7c7b\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u5bf93\u79cd\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u53ca\u7279\u5f02\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed8\u5236\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5de5\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81(ROC)\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97ROC\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a (1)\u7ecf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u6d45\u2161\u5ea6\u3001\u6df1\u2161\u5ea6\u3001\u2162\u5ea6\u70e7\u4f24\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a84%(1 095/1 301)\u300181%(1 215/1 499)\u300182%(1 395/1 700)\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a73%(1 095/1 500)\u300181%(1 215/1 500)\u300193%(1 395/1 500)\uff0cF1\u6307\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.78\u30010.81\u30010.87\u3002(2)tSNE\u4e91\u56fe\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u603b\u4f53\u91cd\u53e0\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6d45\u2161\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6df1\u2161\u5ea6\u3001\u6df1\u2161\u5ea6\u4e0e\u2162\u5ea6\u70e7\u4f24\u4e4b\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u591a\uff0c\u800c\u6d45\u2161\u5ea6\u4e0e\u2162\u5ea6\u70e7\u4f24\u4e4b\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u3002(3)\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b3\u79cd\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684ROC\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\u5747\u22650.94\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u91c7\u7528ResNet-50\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8f83\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u70e7\u4f24\u60a3\u8005\u65e9\u671f\u521b\u9762\u7167\u7247\u4e2d\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6d45\u2161\u5ea6\u4e0e\u2162\u5ea6\u70e7\u4f24\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u70e7\u4f24\u6df1\u5ea6\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002.", "We propose a dataset to investigate the relationship between the fill level of bottles and tiny machine learning algorithms. Tiny machine learning is represented by any Artificial Intelligence algorithm (spanning from conventional decision tree classifiers to artificial neural networks) that can be deployed into a resource constrained micro controller unit (MCU). The data presented has been originally collected for a joint research project by STMicroelectronics and Sesovera.ai. This article describes the recorded image data of bottles with 4 levels of filling. The bottles contain sodium chloride sterile liquid for intravenous administration. One subject of investigation using this dataset could be the classification of the liquid fill level, for example, to ease continuous human visual monitoring which may represent an onerous time-consuming task. Automating the task can help to increase the human work productivity thus saving time. Under normal circumstances, human visual monitoring of the saline level in the bottle is required from time to time. When the saline liquid in the bottle is fully consumed, and the bottle is not replaced or the infusion process stopped immediately, the difference between the patient's blood pressure and the empty saline bottle could cause an outward rush of blood into the saline.", "Gestational weight gain has been associated with some adverse perinatal outcomes, but few studies have examined the association between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognition and their conclusions are inconsistent. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding the association between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills.\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO number, CRD42017073266), we systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library for studies examining association between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills, without restriction in study design or language. Two reviewers extracted in an independent way the data. The Quality of Reporting of Observational Longitudinal Research scale was used to assess the quality of included studies. Effect size (ES) for adjusted models and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for (i) intelligence quotient, (ii) language related skills and (iii) mathematic related skills comparing offspring's cognitive skills when gestational weight gain was within recommendations (as reference) with those from mothers whose gestational weight gain was above or below the recommendations.\nThirteen studies were included. There was a positive trend that associated gestational weight gain above recommendations with better offspring's intelligence quotient, although not statistically significant (ES 0.02, 95% CI -0.00, 0.05; I2\u2009=\u20090.00%).\nThere is a not significant positive association between gestational weight gain above recommendations and intelligence quotient and some studies reported associations between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills. Our analyses confirm a wide variability in the results of studies published so far and highlights the need for conducting studies including specific samples of pregnant women by pre-pregnancy body mass index and trimester of pregnancy.", "In three recent studies, Maul demonstrated that sets of nonsense items can acquire excellent psychometric properties. Our aim was to find out why responses to nonsense items acquire a well-defined structure and high internal consistency.\nWe designed two studies. In the first study, 610 participants responded to eight items where the central term (intelligence) was replaced by the term \"gavagai\". In the second study, 548 participants responded to seven items whose content was totally invented. We asked the participants if they gave any meaning to \"gavagai\", and conducted analyses aimed at uncovering the most suitable structure for modeling responses to meaningless items.\nIn the first study, 81.3% of the sample gave \"gavagai\" meaning, while 18.7% showed they had given it no interpretation. The factorial structures of the two groups were very different from each other. In the second study, the factorial model fitted almost perfectly. However, further analysis revealed that the structure of the data was not continuous but categorical with three unordered classes very similar to midpoint, disacquiescent, and random response styles.\nApparently good psychometric properties on meaningless scales may be due to (a) respondents actually giving an interpretation to the item and responding according to that interpretation, or (b) a false positive because the statistical fit of the factorial model is not sensitive to cases where the actual structure of the data does not come from a common factor. In conclusion, the problem is not in factor analysis, but in the ability of the researcher to elaborate substantive hypotheses about the structure of the data, to employ analytical procedures congruent with those hypotheses, and to understand that a good fit in factor analysis does not have a univocal interpretation and is not sufficient evidence of either validity nor good psychometric properties.", "Violent behavior, police brutality, and racial discrimination are currently at the forefront of society's attention, and they should be. We investigated whether mild sleep loss-as typical for many adults throughout the work week-could aggravate the socio-emotional-cognitive processes contributing to violence and discrimination. In a sample of 40 healthy young adults, we either experimentally restricted participants' sleep for four nights (6.2\u00a0h/night) or let participants obtain normal sleep (7.7\u00a0h/night)-and then had them complete the Police Officer's Dilemma Task. In this computerized task, the participant must rapidly decide to shoot or not shoot at White and Black men who either are or are not holding a gun. Results showed significant racial biases, including more and quicker shooting of Black targets compared to White targets. Furthermore, signal detection analyses demonstrated that mild sleep restriction changed participants' decision criterion, increasing the tendency to shoot, even when controlling for psychomotor vigilance, fluid intelligence, and self-reported desirability to behave in a socially acceptable manner. The increased tendency to shoot was also observed in participants who reported believing that they had adapted to the sleep loss. Future experimental research using trained police officers will help establish the generalizability of these laboratory effects. Importantly, sleep loss is modifiable via organization-level changes (e.g., shift scheduling, light entrainment) and individual-level interventions (e.g., sleep hygiene education, incentives for behavioral change), suggesting that if sleep loss is corrected, it could save lives-including Black lives.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a path-breaking advancement for many industries, including the health care sector. The expeditious development of information technology and data processing has led to the formation of recent tools known as artificial intelligence. Radiology has been a portal for medical technological advancements, and AI will likely be no dissimilar. Radiology is the platform for many technological advances in the medical field; AI can undoubtedly impact every step of a radiologist's workflow. AI can simplify every activity like ordering and scheduling, protocoling and acquisition, image interpretation, reporting, communication, and billing. AI has eminent potential to augment efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also possesses inherent drawbacks and biases. We collected studies that were published in the past five years using PubMed as our database. We chose studies that were relevant to artificial intelligence in radiology. We mainly focused on the overview of AI in radiology, components included in the functioning of AI, AI assisting in the radiologists' workflow, ethical aspects of AI, challenges, and biases that AI experiencing together with some clinical applications of AI. Of all 33 studies, we found 15 articles discussed the overview and components of AI, five articles about AI affecting radiologist's workflow, five articles related to challenges and biases in AI, two articles discussed ethical aspects of AI, and six articles about practical implications of AI. We found out that the application of AI could make time-dependent tasks that can be performed effortlessly, permitting radiologists more time and opportunities to engage in patient care via increased time for consultation and development in imaging and extracting useful data from those images. AI could only be an aid to radiologists but will not\u00a0replace a radiologist. Radiologists who use AI to their benefit, rather than to avoid it out of fear, might supersede those radiologists who do not.\u00a0Substantial research should be done regarding the practical implications of AI algorithms for residents curriculum and the benefits of AI in radiology.", "Despite the pivotal role of radiotherapy in oncology, the provision of radiation treatments remains inadequate in many areas of the world. The present report is an assessment conducted among Radiation Oncology centers of Veneto region with the aim to collect information concerning radiotherapy assets and technological equipment availability.\nData concerning Veneto Radiation Oncology departments about radiotherapy activities, number of treatments, techniques used and radiotherapy machines available were collected. The reference time period was 2018. Reimbursement system databases and business intelligence systems were used. Extra-regional attraction and migration were evaluated. When available, data were compared to previous years.\nVeneto in 2018 was endowed with 1 megavolt unit for about 153,000 inhabitants. The number of megavolt machines per million inhabitants resulted to be 6.72. In 51% of radiotherapy treatments, intensity-modulated techniques were performed. Six percent of treatments were administered to extra-regional patients.\nRadiotherapy assets and equipment in Veneto seem to be appropriate to standard requests in terms of availability and technology.", "Recently, there has been great interest in developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled computer-aided diagnostics solutions for the diagnosis of skin cancer. With the increasing incidence of skin cancers, low awareness among a growing population, and a lack of adequate clinical expertise and services, there is an immediate need for AI systems to assist clinicians in this domain. A large number of skin lesion datasets are available publicly, and researchers have developed AI solutions, particularly deep learning algorithms, to distinguish malignant skin lesions from benign lesions in different image modalities such as dermoscopic, clinical, and histopathology images. Despite the various claims of AI systems achieving higher accuracy than dermatologists in the classification of different skin lesions, these AI systems are still in the very early stages of clinical application in terms of being ready to aid clinicians in the diagnosis of skin cancers. In this review, we discuss advancements in the digital image-based AI solutions for the diagnosis of skin cancer, along with some challenges and future opportunities to improve these AI systems to support dermatologists and enhance their ability to diagnose skin cancer.", "Stem cells are primitive and precursor cells with the potential to reproduce into diverse mature and functional cell types in the body throughout the developmental stages of life. Their remarkable potential has led to numerous medical discoveries and breakthroughs in science. As a result, stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a new subspecialty in medicine. One promising stem cell being investigated is the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC), which is obtained by genetically reprogramming mature cells to convert them into embryonic-like stem cells. These iPSCs are used to study the onset of disease, drug development, and medical therapies. However, functional studies on iPSCs involve the analysis of iPSC-derived colonies through manual identification, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and training-dependent. Thus, an automated instrument for the analysis of iPSC colonies is needed. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a novel technology to tackle this challenge. In particular, deep learning, a subfield of AI, offers an automated platform for analyzing iPSC colonies and other colony-forming stem cells. Deep learning rectifies data features using a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of multi-layered neural network that can play an innovative role in image recognition. CNNs are able to distinguish cells with high accuracy based on morphologic and textural changes. Therefore, CNNs have the potential to create a future field of deep learning tasks aimed at solving various challenges in stem cell studies. This review discusses the progress and future of CNNs in stem cell imaging for therapy and research.", "Safety and efficacy of a novel automated ray tracing optimization in customization of excimer ablation in myopic LASIK.\nIn a consecutive case series, 25 patients (50 eyes) undergoing femtosecond-laser-assisted myopic LASIK were evaluated. The novel, artificial-intelligence platform initially calculates the ablation profile based on a model eye for each case, based on interferometry axial length data. Low- and high-order aberration calculation is performed by raytracing based on wavefront and Scheimpflug tomography measurements, all from a single diagnostic device. Visual acuity, refractive error, keratometry, topography, high-order aberrations and contrast sensitivity were evaluated, over six months follow-up.\nChange from pre- to 6 months post-operative: mean refractive error improved from -5.06 \u00b1 2.54 diopters (D) (range -8.0 to -0.50 D) to -0.11 \u00b1 0.09 D (range -0.25 to + 0.25); refractive astigmatism from -1.07 \u00b1 0.91 D (range -4.25 to 0 D) to -0.15 \u00b1 0.04 D (range -0.25 to 0); and topographic astigmatism from -1.65 \u00b1 0.85 D to -0.26 \u00b1 0.11 D (range -0.60 to 0). About 65% of eyes gained one line of vision and 38% 2 lines. Pre- to post-operative high-order aberration average: RMSh changed from 0.25 um to 0.35 um. Contrast sensitivity improved post-operatively.\nWe report safe and effective preliminary outcomes with a novel excimer laser customization by ray tracing optimization, for myopic LASIK treatments, employing several independent up-till-now diagnostics and a customized eye model reference for each case. It bears the potential advantage through total eye aberration data and ray tracing refraction calculation to offer improved and more predictable visual outcomes.", "Advances in deep learning and neural networking have allowed clinicians to understand the impact that artificial intelligence (AI) could have on improving clinical outcomes and resources expenditures. In the realm of genitourinary (GU) cancers, AI has had particular success in improving the diagnosis and treatment of prostate, renal, and bladder cancers. Numerous studies have developed methods to utilize neural networks to automate prognosis prediction, treatment plan optimization, and patient education. Furthermore, many groups have explored other techniques, including digital pathology and expert 3D modeling systems. Compared to established methods, nearly all the studies showed some level of improvement and there is evidence that AI pipelines can reduce the subjectivity in the diagnosis and management of GU malignancies. However, despite the many potential benefits of utilizing AI in urologic oncology, there are some notable limitations of AI when combating real-world data sets. Thus, it is vital that more prospective studies be conducted that will allow for a better understanding of the benefits of AI to both cancer patients and urologists.", "A new artificial intelligence-based predictive modeling framework called DrugCell could accurately predict effective drugs and treatment combinations based on tumor genotype, according to a proof-of-concept analysis.", "Overcoming the impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on primary schools is an emerging need and priority in the current social welfare system. Accordingly, this study presents an empirical learning package to support teachers, who perform frontline work in schools, in coping with stress, preventing burnout, improving their information and communications technology (ICT) competency, and introducing the principles of emotional intelligence (EI) in the classroom. The participants included 141 primary school teachers (M = 38.4 years, SD = 6.84; 54.6% women). They were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental group participated in the 14-week teacher training program, whereas the control group did not participate in the program or receive any other training during the intervention. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (time x group) was performed to identify the effects of the teacher training program. Teachers who participated in the training program evaluated it positively and showed significant differences compared to the control group in their abilities to cope with stress and avoid burnout, their ICT competency, and their introduction of EI in the classroom. Implications for supporting teachers are discussed.", "The purpose of this study was to analyze the contribution of specific executive function (EF) components to different number knowledge skills. A sample of 143 children attending the last year of preschool educational services (Mage\u00a0=\u00a065.01\u00a0months, SD\u00a0=\u00a03.57) were tested on five number knowledge tasks from the Numerical Intelligence Battery and four EF tasks assessing working memory (WM) and inhibition. First, we examined the interrelationship between different number skills; the results suggested that the relationship between basic informal skills (set comparison and number sequence) and formal skills (seriation of Arabic numerals and number comparison) was mediated by the ability to link sets to numerals. Next, we explored the contribution of WM and inhibition to different number knowledge skills. The structural equation model showed that WM and inhibition were differentially related to specific number knowledge skills. Specifically, WM predicted most components of number knowledge, including the two basic informal skills and the number comparison, whereas inhibition contributed to the seriation of Arabic numerals. The ability to link sets to numerals was predicted only by number sequence, not by EF components.", "Whether exposure to a single general anaesthetic (GA) in early childhood causes long-term neurodevelopmental problems remains unclear.\nPubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to October 2019. Studies evaluating neurodevelopmental outcomes and prospectively enrolling children exposed to a single GA procedure compared with unexposed children were identified. Outcomes common to at least three studies were evaluated using random-effects meta-analyses.\nFull-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ); the parentally reported Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) total, externalising, and internalising problems scores; and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) scores were assessed. Of 1644 children identified, 841 who had a single exposure to GA were evaluated. The CBCL problem scores were significantly higher (i.e. worse) in exposed children: mean score difference (CBCL total: 2.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.0-3.7], P=0.001; CBCL externalising: 1.9 [95% CI: 0.7-3.1], P=0.003; and CBCL internalising problems: 2.2 [95% CI: 0.9-3.5], P=0.001). Differences in BRIEF were not significant after multiple comparison adjustment. Full-scale intelligence quotient was not affected by GA exposure. Secondary analyses evaluating the risk of these scores exceeding predetermined clinical thresholds found that GA exposure was associated with increased risk of CBCL internalising behavioural deficit (risk ratio [RR]: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.08-2.02; P=0.016) and impaired BRIEF executive function (RR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.23-2.30; P=0.001).\nCombining results of studies utilising prospectively collected outcomes showed that a single GA exposure was associated with statistically significant increases in parent reports of behavioural problems with no difference in general intelligence.", "As of May 5, 2020, the number of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases has been more than 3.5 million with 243,540 deaths. We aimed to determine the associations between ageing population, median age, life expectancy at birth and COVID-19 mortality. The numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the European region were obtained from the World Health Organization database. The data on percentage of the population aged 65 and over, median age and life expectancy at birth were extracted from the World Factbook of Central Intelligence Agency. A total of 56 countries/areas in the Europe reported COVID-19 cases and deaths (1,121,853 cases and 100,938 deaths) on April 20, 2020. The results showed significant positive associations between COVID-19 mortality and ageing population (r =0.274; P =0.021), median age (r =0.255; P=0.029), male median age (r =0.284; P =0.017), female median age (r =0.224; P=0.049), life expectancy at birth (r =0.336; P=0.006), male life expectancy at birth (r =0.342; P=0.005), female life expectancy at birth (r =0.312; P=0.01) in the 56 European countries/areas. This study illustrated that COVID-19 mortality was positively associated with ageing population, median age, and life expectancy at birth.", "Background There are characteristic findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on chest images. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs might be useful for triage or infection control within a hospital setting, but prior reports have been limited by small data sets, poor data quality, or both. Purpose To present DeepCOVID-XR, a deep learning AI algorithm to detect COVID-19 on chest radiographs, that was trained and tested on a large clinical data set. Materials and Methods DeepCOVID-XR is an ensemble of convolutional neural networks developed to detect COVID-19 on frontal chest radiographs, with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test results as the reference standard. The algorithm was trained and validated on 14\u2009788 images (4253 positive for COVID-19) from sites across the Northwestern Memorial Health Care System from February 2020 to April 2020 and was then tested on 2214 images (1192 positive for COVID-19) from a single hold-out institution. Performance of the algorithm was compared with interpretations from five experienced thoracic radiologists on 300 random test images using the McNemar test for sensitivity and specificity and the DeLong test for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results A total of 5853 patients (mean age, 58 years \u00b1 19 [standard deviation]; 3101 women) were evaluated across data sets. For the entire test set, accuracy of DeepCOVID-XR was 83%, with an AUC of 0.90. For 300 random test images (134 positive for COVID-19), accuracy of DeepCOVID-XR was 82%, compared with that of individual radiologists (range, 76%-81%) and the consensus of all five radiologists (81%). DeepCOVID-XR had a significantly higher sensitivity (71%) than one radiologist (60%, P < .001) and significantly higher specificity (92%) than two radiologists (75%, P < .001; 84%, P = .009). AUC of DeepCOVID-XR was 0.88 compared with the consensus AUC of 0.85 (P = .13 for comparison). With consensus interpretation as the reference standard, the AUC of DeepCOVID-XR was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.98). Conclusion DeepCOVID-XR, an artificial intelligence algorithm, detected coronavirus disease 2019 on chest radiographs with a performance similar to that of experienced thoracic radiologists in consensus. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Despite high prevalence and severity, the neurochemical basis of FASD remains largely unexplored. The present study evaluated the pharmacological effects of agmatine in cognitive deficits associated with FAS in rat's offsprings prenatally exposed to alcohol. Pregnant rats received ethanol in liquid modified diet during the entire gestational period of 21 days. Offsprings were treated with agmatine (20-80 mg/Kg, i.p.) during early postnatal days (PND: 21-35) and subsequently evaluated for anxiety in elevated plus maze (EPM), depression in forced swim test (FST) and learning and memory in Morris's water maze (MWM) during post adolescent phase. Hippocampal agmatine, BDNF, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels were also analyzed in prenatally ethanol exposed pups. Offsprings prenatally exposed to ethanol demonstrated delayed righting reflex, reduced exploratory behavior along with anxiety, depression-like behavior and impaired memory. These behavioral abnormalities were correlated with a significant reduction in hippocampal agmatine and BDNF levels and elevation in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 immunocontent. Chronic agmatine (40 and 80 mg/Kg, i.p.) administration for 15 days (PND: 21-35), improved entries and time spent in open arm of EPM, decreased immobility time in FST. It also reduced latency to reach the platform location; increased the number of entries, time spent in platform quadrant and also number of crossing over platform quadrant when subjected to MWM test in prenatally ethanol exposed offsprings. This study provides functional evidences for the therapeutic potential of agmatine in cognitive impairment and other neurological complications associated with FASD.", "Polymers are uniquely suited for drug delivery and biomaterial applications due to tunable structural parameters such as length, composition, architecture, and valency. To facilitate designs, researchers may explore combinatorial libraries in a high throughput fashion to correlate structure to function. However, traditional polymerization reactions including controlled living radical polymerization (CLRP) and ring-opening polymerization (ROP) require inert reaction conditions and extensive expertise to implement. With the advent of air-tolerance and automation, several polymerization techniques are now compatible with well plates and can be carried out at the benchtop, making high throughput synthesis and high throughput screening (HTS) possible. To avoid HTS pitfalls often described as \"fishing expeditions,\" it is crucial to employ intelligent and big data approaches to maximize experimental efficiency. This is where the disruptive technologies of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) will likely play a role. In fact, ML and AI are already impacting small molecule drug discovery and showing signs of emerging in drug delivery. In this review, we present state-of-the-art research in drug delivery, gene delivery, antimicrobial polymers, and bioactive polymers alongside data-driven developments in drug design and organic synthesis. From this insight, important lessons are revealed for the polymer therapeutics community including the value of a closed loop design-build-test-learn workflow. This is an exciting time as researchers will gain the ability to fully explore the polymer structural landscape and establish quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) with biological significance.", "Studies on the structure of intelligence refer to two main theoretical models: the first one considers intelligence as a unitary construct, the second one assumes the involvement of a plurality of factors. Studies using Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) tasks have often highlighted the involvement of different cognitive abilities and brain structures, but in the clinical setting, RCPM measurement continues to be used as a single score. The current study aimed to analyse the RCPM performance following qualitative clustering, in order to provide an interpretation of the intelligence assessment through a factorial criterion. The RCPM have been administered to a large group of typically developing children between 6 and 11 years of age. The sample was divided into twelve age groups, and the performance of each age group was shown. Three qualitative item clusters were identified through a factorial criterion. Data showed that performance on RCPM may arise from different cognitive abilities, starting from basic attentional skills up to the more complex ones that require perceptual or analogical reasoning. The qualitative parameters could provide more effective diagnostic and treatment suggestions than a single total score in the clinical setting, and may be crucial for focusing on strength and weakness in the intellectual functionality evaluation of children.", "The combination of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) is having an increasing impact on the field of electrophysiology. Algorithms are created to improve the automated diagnosis of clinical ECGs or ambulatory rhythm devices. Furthermore, the use of AI during invasive electrophysiological studies or combining several diagnostic modalities into AI algorithms to aid diagnostics are being investigated. However, the clinical performance and applicability of created algorithms are yet unknown. In this narrative review, opportunities and threats of AI in the field of electrophysiology are described, mainly focusing on ECGs. Current opportunities are discussed with their potential clinical benefits as well as the challenges. Challenges in data acquisition, model performance, (external) validity, clinical implementation, algorithm interpretation as well as the ethical aspects of AI research are discussed. This article aims to guide clinicians in the evaluation of new AI applications for electrophysiology before their clinical implementation.", "The aims of this study are to compare serum ubiquinone levels in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with healthy controls and to investigate the correlation between ubiquinone levels of children with ADHD and their ADHD symptoms. Twenty-seven children who are 6-12\u00a0years old age with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder having clinically normal intelligence and 23 children with clinically normal intelligence and no psychiatric disorder of similar age and sex who referred to Ankara University School of Medicine Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry were included in this study. All children were diagnosed by same researcher using the Semi-Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Scale for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Interview for School Children-Now and for the Life-Long Version (K-SADS-PL). Parents and teachers of the children completed the Conners Parent Rating Scale Revised Long Form (CPRS-LF) and Conners Teacher Rating Scale Revised Long Form (CTRS-LF). There were no statistically significant differences regarding the age, gender, and sociodemographic data of the groups. Serum ubiquinone levels of the ADHD group were significantly lower than the control group. We did not find any correlation between ubiquinone levels and clinical values. Since ubiquinone levels are lower in children with ADHD compared with controls, we suggest that decreased antioxidant levels may play a role in ADHD pathogenesis by disrupting oxidative balance.", "Despite intelligence research being among the most replicable bodies of empirical findings-a Rosetta stone across the social sciences-the communication of intelligence research with non-intelligence researchers and the public remains a challenge, especially given ongoing public controversies throughout the history of the field. Hunt argued that \"we have a communication problem.\" This article is a call for intelligence researchers to consider communication at multiple levels-communication with other intelligence researchers, communication with non-intelligence researchers, and communication with the public, defined here as policymakers, practitioners, students, and general readers. It discusses ongoing tensions between academic freedom and social responsibility and provides suggestions for thinking about communication and effective research translation and implementation of intelligence research from the frameworks of science and policy research communication. It concludes with some recommendations for effective communication and stresses the importance of incentivizing more scholars to responsibly seek to educate and engage with multiple publics about the science of intelligence.", "Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disease, where HFE C282Y homozygosity accounts for 80-85% of clinical cases among the Caucasian population. HH is characterised by the accumulation of iron, which, if untreated, can lead to the development of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Since iron overload is preventable and treatable if diagnosed early, high-risk individuals can be identified through effective screening employing artificial intelligence-based approaches. However, such tools expose novel challenges associated with the handling and integration of large heterogeneous datasets. We have developed an efficient computational model to screen individuals for HH using the family study data of the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) cohort. This dataset, consisting of 254 cases and 701 controls, contains variables extracted from questionnaires and laboratory blood tests. The final model was trained on an extreme gradient boosting classifier using the most relevant risk factors: HFE C282Y homozygosity, age, mean corpuscular volume, iron level, serum ferritin level, transferrin saturation, and unsaturated iron-binding capacity. Hyperparameter optimisation was carried out with multiple runs, resulting in 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) for tenfold stratified cross-validation, demonstrating its outperformance when compared to the iron overload screening (IRON) tool.", "Infants born very preterm (<32\u00a0weeks of gestation) show distinct cognitive and motor problems throughout childhood. This study aims 1) to investigate differences in the structural connectome between very preterm born children and term born controls at school-age, and 2) to examine the relationship of the structural connectome with cognitive and motor problems. This study included 29 very preterm (12 males, mean age 8.6\u00a0years) and 52 term born peers (25 males, mean age 8.7\u00a0years). Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and Movement Assessment Battery for Children were used. Brain network measures of smallworldness, clustering coefficient and shortest path length based on fiber density of white matter tracts were determined from Diffusion Tensor Imaging data using probabilistic tractography. Smallworldness (F(1,79)\u00a0=\u00a0-2.09, p\u00a0=\u00a0.04, d\u00a0=\u00a00.52) and clustering coefficient (F(1,79)\u00a0=\u00a0-2.63, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01, d\u00a0=\u00a00.64) were significantly higher for very preterm children as compared to term peers. For Total Motor Impairment score and Manual Dexterity, there was a significant interaction between group and smallworldness (Beta\u00a0=\u00a0-10.81, p\u00a0=\u00a0.03 and Beta\u00a0=\u00a0-2.99, p\u00a0=\u00a0.004, respectively). Greater Total Motor Impairment and poorer Manual Dexterity were only significantly related to higher smallworldness in term controls (r\u00a0=\u00a00.35, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01 and r\u00a0=\u00a00.27, p =\u00a0.04, respectively). Poorer Ball Skills were significantly related to higher smallworldness in both groups (Beta\u00a0=\u00a0-0.30, p\u00a0=\u00a0.03). This study clearly shows a more segregated network organization in very preterm children as compared to term peers. Importantly, motor problems go together with altered organization of the structural connectome in term born children, whereas this potential compensational process is only found for Ball Skills for very preterm children.", "Anterior mediastinal cysts (AMC) are often misdiagnosed as thymomas and undergo surgical resection, which caused unnecessary treatment and medical resource waste. The purpose of this study is to explore potential possibility of computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics for the diagnosis of AMC and type B1 and B2 thymomas.\nA group of 188 patients with pathologically confirmed AMC (106 cases misdiagnosed as thymomas in CT) and thymomas (82 cases) and underwent routine chest CT from January 2010 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. The lesions were manually delineated using ITK-SNAP software, and radiomics features were performed using the artificial intelligence kit (AK) software. A total of 180 tumour texture features were extracted from enhanced CT and unenhanced CT, respectively. The general test, correlation analysis, and LASSO were used to features selection and then the radiomics signature (radscore) was obtained. The combined model including radscore and independent clinical factors was developed. The model performances were evaluated on discrimination, calibration curve.\nTwo radscore models were constructed from the unenhanced and enhanced phases based on the selected four and three features, respectively. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the enhanced radscore model were 0.928, 89.3%, and 83.8% in the training dataset and 0.899, 84.6%, and 87.5% in the test dataset (higher than the unenhanced radscore model). The combined model of enhanced CT including radiomics features and independent clinical factors yielded an AUC, sensitivity and specificity of 0.941, 82.1%, and 94.6% in the training dataset and 0.938, 92.3%, and 87.5% in the test dataset (higher than the unenhanced combined model and enhanced radscore model).\nThe study suggested the possibility that the combined model in enhanced CT provided a potential tool to facilitate the differential diagnosis of AMC and type B1 and B2 thymomas.", "Deep learning is one of the most popular artificial intelligence techniques used in the medical field. Although it is at an early stage compared to deep learning analyses of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, studies applying deep learning to ultrasound imaging have been actively conducted. This review analyzes recent studies that applied deep learning to ultrasound imaging of various abdominal organs and explains the challenges encountered in these applications.", "To develop and verify a digital twin model of critically ill patient using the causal artificial intelligence approach to predict the response to specific treatment during the first 24 hours of sepsis.\nDirected acyclic graphs were used to define explicitly the causal relationship among organ systems and specific treatments used. A hybrid approach of agent-based modeling, discrete-event simulation, and Bayesian network was used to simulate treatment effect across multiple stages and interactions of major organ systems (cardiovascular, neurologic, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, inflammatory, and hematology). Organ systems were visualized using relevant clinical markers. The application was iteratively revised and debugged by clinical experts and engineers. Agreement statistics was used to test the performance of the model by comparing the observed patient response versus the expected response (primary and secondary) predicted by digital twin.\nMedical ICU of a large quaternary- care academic medical center in the United States.\nAdult (> 18 year yr old), medical ICU patients were included in the study.\nNo additional interventions were made beyond the standard of care for this study.\nDuring the verification phase, model performance was prospectively tested on 145 observations in a convenience sample of 29 patients. Median age was 60 years (54-66 d) with a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 9.5 (interquartile range, 5.0-14.0). The most common source of sepsis was pneumonia, followed by hepatobiliary. The observations were made during the first 24 hours of the ICU admission with one-step interventions, comparing the output in the digital twin with the real patient response. The agreement between the observed versus and the expected response ranged from fair (kappa coefficient of 0.41) for primary response to good (kappa coefficient of 0.65) for secondary response to the intervention. The most common error detected was coding error in 50 observations (35%), followed by expert rule error in 29 observations (20%) and timing error in seven observations (5%).\nWe confirmed the feasibility of development and prospective testing of causal artificial intelligence model to predict the response to treatment in early stages of critical illness. The availability of qualitative and quantitative data and a relatively short turnaround time makes the ICU an ideal environment for development and testing of digital twin patient models. An accurate digital twin model will allow the effect of an intervention to be tested in a virtual environment prior to use on real patients.", "With recent transformations in medical education, the integration of technology to improve medical students' abilities has become feasible. Artificial intelligence (AI) has impacted several aspects of healthcare. However, few studies have focused on medical education. We performed an AI-assisted education study and confirmed that AI can accelerate trainees' medical image learning.\nWe developed an AI-based medical image learning system to highlight hip fracture on a plain pelvic film. Thirty medical students were divided into a conventional (CL) group and an AI-assisted learning (AIL) group. In the CL group, the participants received a prelearning test and a postlearning test. In the AIL group, the participants received another test with AI-assisted education before the postlearning test. Then, we analyzed changes in diagnostic accuracy.\nThe prelearning performance was comparable in both groups. In the CL group, postlearning accuracy (78.66\u2009\u00b1\u200914.53) was higher than prelearning accuracy (75.86\u2009\u00b1\u200911.36) with no significant difference (p\u2009=\u2009.264). The AIL group showed remarkable improvement. The WithAI score (88.87\u2009\u00b1\u20095.51) was significantly higher than the prelearning score (75.73\u2009\u00b1\u200910.58, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Moreover, the postlearning score (84.93\u2009\u00b1\u200914.53) was better than the prelearning score (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The increase in accuracy was significantly higher in the AIL group than in the CL group.\nThe study demonstrated the viability of AI for augmenting medical education. Integrating AI into medical education requires dynamic collaboration from research, clinical, and educational perspectives.", "Thermoresponsive hydrogel-based actuators are highly important for fundamental research and industrial applications, while the preparation of temperature-driven bilayer hydrogel actuators with rapid response to bend and recover properties remains a challenge. To date, most temperature-driven bilayer hydrogel actuators are based on polymers only with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) or with an upper critical solution temperature (UCST), which need more time to bend and recover just in a small range of bending angle. Herein, we propose a new strategy to design and synthesize a fully temperature-driven bilayer hydrogel actuator, which consists of a poly(N-acryloyl glycinamide) (NAGA) layer with a UCST-type volume phase change and a poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (NIPAM)-Laponite nanocomposite layer with an LCST-type volume phase change. Due to the complementary UCST and LCST behavior of the two selected polymers, both layers have opposite thermoresponsive swelling and shrinkage properties at low and high temperatures; this imbues the hydrogel actuator with rapid thermoresponsive bending and recovery ability, as well as a large bending angle. In addition, the incorporation of Laponite nanosheets in PNIPAM layer not only improves the mechanical property of actuators but also provides the excellent bonding ability of the two-layer interface, which prevents delamination caused by excessive local stress on the interface during the bending process. Thanks to high-performance behavior, the actuator can act as an effective and sensitive actuator, such as a gripper to capture, transport, and release an object, or as an electrical circuit switch to turn on and off a light-emitting diode (LED). Overall, such hydrogel actuator may provide new insights for the design and fabrication of artificial intelligence materials.", "In the last decade, artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have been more and more established for the screening and detection of diseases and pathologies, as well as for describing interactions between measures where classical methods are too complex or fail. The purpose of this paper is to model the measured postoperative position of an intraocular lens implant after cataract surgery, based on preoperatively assessed biometric effect sizes using techniques of machine learning.\nIn this study, we enrolled 249 eyes of patients who underwent elective cataract surgery at Augenklinik Castrop-Rauxel. Eyes were measured preoperatively with the IOLMaster 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec), as well as preoperatively and postoperatively with the Casia 2 OCT (Tomey). Based on preoperative effect sizes axial length, corneal thickness, internal anterior chamber depth, thickness of the crystalline lens, mean corneal radius and corneal diameter a selection of 17 machine learning algorithms were tested for prediction performance for calculation of internal anterior chamber depth (AQD_post) and axial position of equatorial plane of the lens in the pseudophakic eye (LEQ_post).\nThe 17 machine learning algorithms (out of 4 families) varied in root mean squared/mean absolute prediction error between 0.187/0.139\u2009mm and 0.255/0.204\u2009mm (AQD_post) and 0.183/0.135\u2009mm and 0.253/0.206\u2009mm (LEQ_post), using 5-fold cross validation techniques. The Gaussian Process Regression Model using an exponential kernel showed the best performance in terms of root mean squared error for prediction of AQDpost and LEQpost. If the entire dataset is used (without splitting for training and validation data), comparison of a simple multivariate linear regression model vs. the algorithm with the best performance showed a root mean squared prediction error for AQD_post/LEQ_post with 0.188/0.187\u2009mm vs. the best performance Gaussian Process Regression Model with 0.166/0.159\u2009mm.\nIn this paper we wanted to show the principles of supervised machine learning applied to prediction of the measured physical postoperative axial position of the intraocular lenses. Based on our limited data pool and the algorithms used in our setting, the benefit of machine learning algorithms seems to be limited compared to a standard multivariate regression model.\nIn den vergangenen Jahren wurden zunehmend Systeme der k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz in der Medizin etabliert, die Pathologien oder Erkrankungen erkennen und schwer zu erfassende Zusammenh\u00e4nge zwischen Eingangsgr\u00f6\u00dfen beschreiben sollen. Ziel der Studie ist es, anhand von biometrischen Messgr\u00f6\u00dfen vor der Kataraktoperation die physikalische Position der Intraokularlinse nach der Operation mit Verfahren des maschinellen Lernens vorherzusagen.\n249 Augen von Patienten, die sich zur elektiven Kataraktoperation an der Augenklinik Castrop-Rauxel vorstellten, wurden mit dem IOLMaster 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec) und vor sowie nach der Operation mit dem Casia 2 (Tomey) untersucht. Aus den Effektgr\u00f6\u00dfen Augenl\u00e4nge, Hornhautdicke, interne Vorderkammertiefe, Linsendicke, mittlerer Hornhautradius und Hornhautdurchmesser wurde eine Auswahl von 17 Algorithmen des Maschinenlernens auf ihre Vorhersagequalit\u00e4t hin getestet f\u00fcr die Bestimmung der postoperativen internen Vorderkammertiefe (AQD_post) und der Lage des Linsen\u00e4quators relativ zum Hornhautscheitel (LEQ_post).\nDie 17 Modelle (4 Algorithmusfamilien) variierten im mittleren quadratischen/mittleren absoluten Vorhersagefehler zwischen 0,187/0,139\u2009mm und 0,255/0,204\u2009mm (AQD_post) und 0,183/0,135\u2009mm und 0,253/0,206\u2009mm (LEQ_post) bei einer Kreuzvalidierung (5-fold cross validation). Der Algorithmus mit der besten Performance war bei beiden Vorhersagen ein Gaussian Process Regression Model mit einem exponentiellen Kernel. Pr\u00fcft man am gesamten Datensatz (ohne Aufteilung in Trainings- und Validierungsdaten) ein einfaches multiples lineares Regressionsmodell gegen den Algorithmus mit der besten Performance, so ergibt sich bei der Vorhersage von AQD_post/LEQ_post ein mittlerer quadratischer Vorhersagefehler von 0,188/0,187\u2009mm gegen\u00fcber dem Gaussian Process Regression Model mit 0,166/0,159\u2009mm.\nIn der Arbeit soll das Prinzip des \u00fcberwachten Maschinenlernens in der Anwendung auf die Nachbildung der physikalisch gemessenen postoperativen axialen Position von Intraokularlinsen gezeigt werden.

Progress in the last two decades has been marked by advances in every modality used to image the heart, including echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, cardiac CT and nuclear cardiology. There has also been a dramatic increase in hybrid and fusion modalities that leverage the unique capabilities of two imaging techniques simultaneously, as well as the incorporation of artificial intelligence and machine learning into the clinical workflow. These advances in non-invasive cardiac imaging have guided patient management and improved clinical outcomes. The technological developments of the past 20 years have also given rise to new imaging subspecialities and increased the demand for dedicated cardiac imagers who are cross-trained in multiple modalities. This state-of-the-art review summarizes the evolution of multimodality cardiac imaging in the 21st century and highlights opportunities for future innovation.", "Anomalous self-experiences (ASEs) are prevalent in schizophrenia, but its underpinnings are not completely understood. Given the likely complex substrate of the experience of the self, neurocognitive functions requiring coordinate cerebral activity may relate to ASEs. Moreover, cognitive deficits functioning may be involved in the link between self-experience disturbances and some aspects of social dysfunction in schizophrenia. We have assessed ASEs in 41 schizophrenia patients (11 first episodes) using the Inventory of Psychotic-Like Anomalous Self-Experiences (IPASE), and the general cognition using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). Besides, social cognition was assessed using two complementary tools Meyer, Salovey and Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) and GEOPTE (Grupo Espa\u00f1ol para la Optimizaci\u00f3n del Tratamiento de la Esquizofrenia). The results revealed that Self-awareness/presence and Somatization IPASE scores were inversely explained by motor speed in the BACS; Consciousness IPASE scores were inversely explained by problem solving performance in the BACS. These data reveal a significant relationship between certain domains of general cognition and anomalous self-experiences, that may be useful in further investigation on the substrates of ASEs.", "Dietary habits represent the main determinant of health. Although extensive research has been conducted to modify unhealthy dietary behaviors across the lifespan, obesity and obesity-associated comorbidities are increasingly observed worldwide. Individually tailored interventions are nowadays considered a promising frontier for nutritional research. In this narrative review, the technologies of importance in a pediatric clinical setting are discussed. The first determinant of the dietary balance is represented by energy intakes matching individual needs. Most emerging studies highlight the opportunity to reconsider the widely used prediction equations of resting energy expenditure. Artificial Neural Network approaches may help to disentangle the role of single contributors to energy expenditure. Artificial intelligence is also useful in the prediction of the glycemic response, based on the individual microbiome. Other factors further concurring to define individually tailored nutritional needs are metabolomics and nutrigenomic. Since most available data come from studies in adult groups, new efforts should now be addressed to integrate all these aspects to develop comprehensive and-above all-effective interventions for children. IMPACT: Personalized dietary advice, specific to individuals, should be more effective in the prevention of chronic diseases than general recommendations about diet. Artificial Neural Networks algorithms are technologies of importance in a pediatric setting that may help practitioners to provide personalized nutrition. Other approaches to personalized nutrition, while promising in adults and for basic research, are still far from practical application in pediatrics.", "In the path underway towards Precision Medicine, two areas are in rapid development: genetics and artificial intelligence. In the genetic area, there are two current problems, both of the highest social importance. The first concerns the project, emerging in some countries, of systematic sequencing of the genome in the whole population. The problem is that reading the genome is very complex, requires specific knowledge, and the medical class is now unprepared. The second problem concerns the now achieved ability to modify the genome, which might be applied in the treatment of genetic diseases previously considered incurable. The techniques that can be used today are extremely delicate and expose to high risks. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of neuroscience ('computational neuroscience') and advanced computer science which aims to apply the operational models of the human mind with the mnemonic and calculating power of advanced cybernetics. It is applied by conventional smartphone 'apps' to the most advanced computers used in various areas of diagnostic and prognostic medicine, image reading, big data management, setting of new pharmacological molecules, up to completely different applications, such as spoken language, automatic driving of vehicles, insurance plans, financial strategies, etc. Of course, with enormously different degrees of complexity. Will the doctors' role survive?", "The neural substrate of high intelligence performances remains not well understood. Based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) which provides microstructural information of white matter fibers, we proposed in this work to investigate the relationship between structural brain connectivity and intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. Fifty-seven children (8-12 y.o.) underwent a MRI examination, including conventional T1-weighted and DTI sequences, and neuropsychological testing using the fourth edition of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), providing an estimation of the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) based on four subscales: verbal comprehension index (VCI), perceptual reasoning index (PRI), working memory index (WMI), and processing speed index (PSI). Correlations between the IQ scores and both graphs and diffusivity metrics were explored. First, we found significant correlations between the increased integrity of WM fiber-bundles and high intelligence scores. Second, the graph theory analysis showed that integration and segregation graph metrics were positively and negatively correlated with WISC-IV scores, respectively. These results were mainly driven by significant correlations between FSIQ, VCI, and PRI and graph metrics in the temporal and parietal lobes. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that intelligence performances are related to the integrity of WM fiber-bundles as well as the density and homogeneity of WM brain networks.", "The information technologies have been increasing exponentially following Moore's law over the past decades. This has fundamentally changed the ways of work and life. However, further improving data process efficiency is facing great challenges because of physical and architectural limitations. More powerful computational methodologies are crucial to fulfill the technology gap in the post-Moore's law period. The memristor exhibits promising prospects in information storage, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence. Since the memristor was theoretically predicted by L. O. Chua in 1971 and experimentally confirmed by HP Laboratories in 2008, it has attracted great attention from worldwide researchers. The intrinsic properties of memristors, such as simple structure, low power consumption, compatibility with the complementary metal oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, and dual functionalities of the data storage and computation, demonstrate great prospects in many applications. In this review, we cover the memristor-relevant computing technologies, from basic materials to in-memory computing and future prospects. First, the materials and mechanisms in the memristor are discussed. Then, we present the development of the memristor in the domains of the synapse simulating, in-memory logic computing, deep neural networks (DNNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Finally, the existent technology challenges and outlook of the state-of-art applications are proposed.", "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of acute pancreatitis (AP) that is associated with increased mortality. Conventional assessment of AKI is based on changes in serum creatinine concentration and urinary output. However, these examinations have limited accuracy and sensitivity for the diagnosis of early-stage AKI. This review summarizes current evidence on the use of advanced imaging approaches and artificial intelligence (AI) for the early prediction and diagnosis of AKI in patients with AP. CT scores, CT post-processing technology, Doppler ultrasound, and AI technology provide increasingly valuable information for the diagnosis of AP-induced AKI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also has potential for the evaluation of AP-induced AKI. For the accurate diagnosis of early-stage AP-induced AKI, more studies are needed that use these new techniques and that use AI in combination with advanced imaging technologies.", "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease. Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) and predominant parkinsonism (PSP-P) are characterized by wide range of cognitive and behavioural disturbances, but these variants show similar cognitive pattern of alterations, leading difficult differential diagnosis. For this reason, we explored with an Artificial Intelligence approach, whether cognitive impairment could differentiate the phenotypes. Forty Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, 25 PSP-P, 40 PSP-RS, and 34 controls were enrolled following the consensus criteria diagnosis. Participants were evaluated with neuropsychological battery for cognitive domains. Random Forest models were used for exploring the discriminant power of the cognitive tests in distinguishing among the four groups. The classifiers for distinguishing diseases from controls reached high accuracies (86% for PD, 95% for PSP-P, 99% for PSP-RS). Regarding the differential diagnosis, PD was discriminated from PSP-P with 91% (important variables: HAMA, MMSE, JLO, RAVLT_I, BDI-II) and from PSP-RS with 92% (important variables: COWAT, JLO, FAB). PSP-P was distinguished from PSP-RS with 84% (important variables: JLO, WCFST, RAVLT_I, Digit span_F). This study revealed that PSP-P, PSP-RS and PD had peculiar cognitive deficits compared with healthy subjects, from which they were discriminated with optimal accuracies. Moreover, high accuracies were reached also in differential diagnosis. Most importantly, Machine Learning resulted to be useful to the clinical neuropsychologist in choosing the most appropriate neuropsychological tests for the cognitive evaluation of PSP patients.", "Background: The ability to differentiate emotions in social contexts is important for dealing with challenging social situations. Suicide attempters show some difficulties in emotion recognition that may result in hypersensitivity to social stress. However, other studies on the recognition of social complex emotions found that suicide attempters have similar performances as depressed non-attempters. Objectives: To investigate differences in social emotion recognition in patients with current Major Depressive Episode (MDE) with and without history of suicide attempt. Methods: Two hundred and ten patients with MDE were recruited among whom 115 had lifetime history of suicide attempt (suicide attempters, SA) and 95 did not (affective controls, AC). Recognition of complex social emotions was assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Emotions were separated in three valence categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) and attention were measured with the National Adult Reading Task (NART) and the d2 test, respectively. Results: Mixed logistic regression models adjusted for sex, lifetime bipolar disorder, verbal IQ and attention showed that the RMET performance for neutral emotions was worse in the SA than AC group (OR = 0.87 [0.75, 0.99]). Furthermore, when violent/serious SA were compared to non-violent/non-serious SA and AC, the RMET neutral valence category showed a trend for group factor (p < 0.059) and RMET scores were lower in the violent/serious SA than AC group (OR = 0.79 [0.64, 0.96]). Conclusion: Recognition of neutral emotions is poor in SA and this may complicate their daily life. Interventions to improve the understanding of complex emotions may be helpful to prevent suicidal risk in patients with depression.", "In contrast to the commonly present UV light-stimulated synaptic oxide thin-film transistors, this study demonstrates a violet light (wavelength of 405 nm) stimulated zinc-tin oxide (ZTO) photoelectric transistor for potential application in optical neuromorphic computation. Owing to the light-induced oxygen vacancy ionization and persistent photoconductivity effect in ZTO, this device well imitates prominent synaptic functions, including photonic potentiation, electric depression, and short-term memory (STM) to long-term memory (LTM) transition. A highly linear and broad dynamic range of photonic potentiation can be achieved by modulating the light power density, while electric depression is realized by gate voltage pulsing. In addition, the brain-like re-learning experience with extended forgetting time (200 s) is well mimicked by the ZTO photoelectric transistor. As a result, the ZTO photoelectric transistor provides excessive synaptic function with multi-series of synaptic weight levels (90 levels for each given light power density), which makes it prevalent in the neuromorphic computation of massive data as well as in learning-driven artificial intelligence computation.", "Patients desire facelifting procedures to look younger, refreshed, and attractive. Unfortunately, there are few objective studies assessing the success of types of facelift procedures and ancillary techniques.\nThe authors sought to utilize convolutional neural network algorithms alongside patient-reported FACE-Q outcomes to evaluate perceived age reduction and patient satisfaction following various facelift techniques.\nStandardized preoperative and postoperative (1-year) images of patients who underwent facelift procedures were analyzed by 4 neural networks to estimate age reduction after surgery (n = 105). FACE-Q surveys were employed to measure patient-reported facial aesthetic outcome. We compared (1) facelift procedure type: skin-only vs superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS)-plication, vs SMAS-ectomy; and (2) ancillary techniques: fat grafting (malar) vs no fat grafting. Outcomes were based on complications, estimated age-reduction, and patient satisfaction.\nThe neural network preoperative age accuracy score demonstrated that all neural networks were accurate in identifying our patients' ages (mean score = 100.4). SMAS-ectomy and SMAS-plication had significantly greater age-reduction (5.85 and 5.35 years, respectively) compared with skin-only (2.95 years, P < 0.05). Fat grafting compared to no fat grafting demonstrated 2.1 more years of age reduction. Facelift procedure type did not affect FACE-Q scores; however, patients who underwent fat grafting had a higher satisfaction with outcome (78.1 \u00b1 8 vs 69 \u00b1 6, P < 0.05) and decision to have the procedure (83.0 \u00b1 6 vs 72 \u00b1 9, P < 0.05).\nArtificial intelligence algorithms can reliably estimate the reduction in apparent age after facelift surgery. Facelift technique, like SMAS-ectomy or SMAS-plication, and specific technique, like fat grafting, were found to enhance facelifting outcomes and patient satisfaction.", "Robotic surgery was introduced into general surgery more than 20\u00a0years ago. Shortly afterwards, Horgan performed the first robotic-assisted esophagectomy in 2003 in Chicago. The aim of this manuscript is to elucidate new developments and training methods in robotic surgery with a\u00a0cost-benefit analysis for robotic-assisted Ivor Lewis esophagectomy.\nSystematic literature search regarding new technology and training methods for robotic surgery and cost analysis of intraoperative materials for hybrid and robotic-assisted Ivor Lewis esophagectomy.\nRobotic-assisted esophageal surgery is complex and involves an extensive learning curve, which can be shortened with modern teaching methods. New robotic systems aim at the use of image-guided surgery and artificial intelligence. Robotic-assisted surgery of esophageal cancer is significantly more expensive that surgery without this technology.\nOncological short-term and long-term benefits need to be further evaluated to support the higher cost of robotic esophageal cancer surgery.\nEINLEITUNG: Robotische Systeme wurden vor \u00fcber 20\u00a0Jahren zum ersten Mal in die Viszeralchirurgie eingef\u00fchrt, kurz darauf f\u00fchrte Horgan in Chicago 2003 die erste roboterassistierte \u00d6sophagusresektion durch. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die Darstellung neuer Techniken und Trainingsmethoden f\u00fcr die roboterassistierte Chirurgie mit Kosten-Nutzen-Bewertung am Beispiel der Ivor-Lewis-\u00d6sophagektomie METHODEN: Es erfolgte eine systematische Literaturrecherche zu neuen Technologien im Bereich der roboterassistierten Chirurgie und Kostenanalyse der intraoperativen Verbrauchsmaterialien f\u00fcr die Hybrid-Ivor-Lewis-\u00d6sophagektomie sowie die roboterassistierte Ivor-Lewis-\u00d6sophagektomie.\nRoboterassistierte \u00d6sophaguschirurgie ist komplex und erfordert eine aufwendige Lernphase.

However, it is unclear whether this has affected radiology residency applications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate recent trends in the Canadian radiology residency match.\nCanadian Resident Matching Service annual data reports from 2010-2020 were collected. Statistics were extracted for Canadian medical graduates applying to radiology in the R-1 main residency match and analyzed using linear regression.\nThe number of available radiology residency positions decreased (P = .01); declining from 84 in 2010 to 81 in 2020 (mean = 83.1). The overall number of applicants did not change (P = .08, mean = 131.8). The proportion of applicants with radiology as their first choice decreased (P = .001); declining from 4.5% in 2010 to 3.1% in 2020 (mean = 3.4%). The number of applicants applying exclusively to radiology also decreased (P = .02); declining from 39 in 2010 to 16 in 2020 (mean = 23). Positions per applicant (P = 0.24, mean = 0.64), and positions per applicant with radiology as their first choice did not change (P = 0.07, mean = 0.91).\nWhile the overall number of students applying to radiology did not change, the number of applicants ranking radiology as their first or only choice decreased sharply. This analysis corroborates recent reports of increased workload, burnout, and declining reimbursement as well as uncertainty about the future of radiology due to advances in AI.", "Geriatric clinical care is a multidisciplinary assessment designed to evaluate older patients' (age 65 years and above) functional ability, physical health, and cognitive well-being. The majority of these patients suffer from multiple chronic conditions and require special attention. Recently, hospitals utilize various artificial intelligence (AI) systems to improve care for elderly patients. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to understand the current use of AI systems, particularly machine learning (ML), in geriatric clinical care for chronic diseases.\nWe restricted our search to eight databases, namely PubMed, WorldCat, MEDLINE, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Wiley, and ERIC, to analyze research articles published in English between January 2010 and June 2019. We focused on studies that used ML algorithms in the care of geriatrics patients with chronic conditions.\nWe identified 35 eligible studies and classified in three groups: psychological disorder (n\u2009=\u200922), eye diseases (n\u2009=\u20096), and others (n\u2009=\u20097). This review identified the lack of standardized ML evaluation metrics and the need for data governance specific to health care applications.\nMore studies and ML standardization tailored to health care applications are required to confirm whether ML could aid in improving geriatric clinical care.", "Chest X-ray data have been found to be very promising for assessing COVID-19 patients, especially for resolving emergency-department and urgent-care-center overcapacity. Deep-learning (DL) methods in artificial intelligence (AI) play a dominant role as high-performance classifiers in the detection of the disease using chest X-rays. Given many new DL models have been being developed for this purpose, the objective of this study is to investigate the fine tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. If fine-tuned pre-trained CNNs can provide equivalent or better classification results than other more sophisticated CNNs, then the deployment of AI-based tools for detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray data can be more rapid and cost-effective.\nThree pretrained CNNs, which are AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet, were selected and fine-tuned without data augmentation to carry out 2-class and 3-class classification tasks using 3 public chest X-ray databases.\nIn comparison with other recently developed DL models, the 3 pretrained CNNs achieved very high classification results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F 1  score, and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve.\nAlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet require the least training time among pretrained DL models, but with suitable selection of training parameters, excellent classification results can be achieved without data augmentation by these networks. The findings contribute to the urgent need for harnessing the pandemic by facilitating the deployment of AI tools that are fully automated and readily available in the public domain for rapid implementation.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) can extract complex information from visual data. Histopathology images of gastrointestinal (GI) and liver cancer contain a very high amount of information which human observers can only partially make sense of. Complementing human observers, AI allows an in-depth analysis of digitised histological slides of GI and liver cancer and offers a wide range of clinically relevant applications. First, AI can automatically detect tumour tissue, easing the exponentially increasing workload on pathologists. In addition, and possibly exceeding pathologist's capacities, AI can capture prognostically relevant tissue features and thus predict clinical outcome across GI and liver cancer types. Finally, AI has demonstrated its capacity to infer molecular and genetic alterations of cancer tissues from histological digital slides. These are likely only the first of many AI applications that will have important clinical implications. Thus, pathologists and clinicians alike should be aware of the principles of AI-based pathology and its ability to solve clinically relevant problems, along with its limitations and biases.", "The models used to estimate disease transmission, susceptibility and severity determine what epidemiology can (and cannot tell) us about COVID-19. These include: 'model organisms' chosen for their phylogenetic/aetiological similarities; multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of (potentially causal) relationships between variables (through 'causal inference'), and the (past/future) value of unmeasured variables (through 'classification/prediction'); and a range of modelling techniques to predict beyond the available data (through 'extrapolation'), compare different hypothetical scenarios (through 'simulation'), and estimate key features of dynamic processes (through 'projection'). Each of these models: address different questions using different techniques; involve assumptions that require careful assessment; and are vulnerable to generic and specific biases that can undermine the validity and interpretation of their findings. It is therefore necessary that the models used: can actually address the questions posed; and have been competently applied. In this regard, it is important to stress that extrapolation, simulation and projection cannot offer accurate predictions of future events when the underlying mechanisms (and the contexts involved) are poorly understood and subject to change. Given the importance of understanding such mechanisms/contexts, and the limited opportunity for experimentation during outbreaks of novel diseases, the use of multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of potentially causal relationships between two variables (and the biases incurred through their misapplication/misinterpretation) warrant particular attention. Such models must be carefully designed to address: 'selection-collider bias', 'unadjusted confounding bias' and 'inferential mediator adjustment bias' - all of which can introduce effects capable of enhancing, masking or reversing the estimated (true) causal relationship between the two variables examined.1 Selection-collider bias occurs when these two variables independently cause a third (the 'collider'), and when this collider determines/reflects the basis for selection in the analysis. It is likely to affect all incompletely representative samples, although its effects will be most pronounced wherever selection is constrained (e.g. analyses focusing on infected/hospitalised individuals). Unadjusted confounding bias disrupts the estimated (true) causal relationship between two variables when: these share one (or more) common cause(s); and when the effects of these causes have not been adjusted for in the analyses (e.g. whenever confounders are unknown/unmeasured). Inferentially similar biases can occur when: one (or more) variable(s) (or 'mediators') fall on the causal path between the two variables examined (i.e. when such mediators are caused by one of the variables and are causes of the other); and when these mediators are adjusted for in the analysis. Such adjustment is commonplace when: mediators are mistaken for confounders; prediction models are mistakenly repurposed for causal inference; or mediator adjustment is used to estimate direct and indirect causal relationships (in a mistaken attempt at 'mediation analysis'). These three biases are central to ongoing and unresolved epistemological tensions within epidemiology. All have substantive implications for our understanding of COVID-19, and the future application of artificial intelligence to 'data-driven' modelling of similar phenomena. Nonetheless, competently applied and carefully interpreted, multivariable statistical models may yet provide sufficient insight into mechanisms and contexts to permit more accurate projections of future disease outbreaks.", "We investigated the relationship between electroencephalographic (EEG) functional connectivity and executive function in children with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE).\nWe enrolled 24 children with FLE (mean age, 11.0\u202fyears; 13 boys) and 22 sex-, age-, and intelligence-matched typically developing children (TDC) to undergo 19-channel EEG during light sleep. We estimated functional connectivity using the phase lag index (PLI) that captures the synchronization of EEG. We also performed continuous performance tests (CPTs) on the children and obtained questionnaire responses on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD).\nThe average gamma PLI was lower in the FLE group than in the TDC group, especially between long-distance frontoparietal pairs, between interhemispheric frontal pairs, and between interhemispheric parietotemporal pairs. Gamma PLIs with long-distance frontoparietal and interhemispheric frontal pairs were positively associated with inattention, ODD scores, omission error, and reaction time in the FLE group but not in the TDC group. Conversely, they were negatively associated with age, hyperactivity score, and commission error.\nA lack of functional connectivity of the frontal brain regions in children with FLE was associated with poor response inhibition.", "Emerging wearable and implantable biodevices have been significantly revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of disease. However, the geometrical mismatch between tissues and biodevices remains a great challenge for achieving optimal performances and functionalities for biodevices. Shape-adaptable biodevices enabling active compliance with human body tissues offer promising opportunities for addressing the challenge through programming their geometries on demand. This article reviews the design principles and control strategies for shape-adaptable biodevices with programmable shapes and actively compliant capabilities, which have offered innovative diagnostic/therapeutic tools and facilitated a variety of wearable and implantable applications. The state-of-the-art progress in applications of shape-adaptable biodevices in the fields of smart textiles, wound care, healthcare monitoring, drug and cell delivery, tissue repair and regeneration, nerve stimulation and recording, and biopsy and surgery, is highlighted. Despite the remarkable advances already made, shape-adaptable biodevices still confront many challenges on the road toward the clinic, such as enhanced intelligence for actively sensing and operating in response to physiological environments. Next-generation paradigms will shed light on future directions for extending the breadth and performance of shape-adaptable biodevices for wearable and implantable applications.", "During the evacuation process in an emergency, the route conditions usually change instantaneously, which makes routing selection a challenging work. To describe dynamic changes in the evacuation environment, this work proposes a real-time evacuation strategy based on a comprehensive route constraint in the framework of a cell-inspired simulation model, intelligence decision P system (IDPS). In our model, the comprehensive route constraint is formed to describe more complex road condition information including the total distance, congestion state, and unreliability of the route. Meanwhile, the IDPS model has been further improved in both the knowledge base description and the decision-making ability. Experiments are conducted to simulate five different scenarios in a fire evacuation. The results show that the evacuation strategy with a comprehensive route constraint has a significant improvement in the evacuation efficiency and has higher robustness. Which kind of route condition should be emphasized more in different evacuation scenarios is also analyzed.", "Bone metastasis is among the most frequent in diseases to patients suffering from metastatic cancer, such as breast or prostate cancer. A popular diagnostic method is bone scintigraphy where the whole body of the patient is scanned. However, hot spots that are presented in the scanned image can be misleading, making the accurate and reliable diagnosis of bone metastasis a challenge. Artificial intelligence can play a crucial role as a decision support tool to alleviate the burden of generating manual annotations on images and therefore prevent oversights by medical experts. So far, several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been employed to address bone metastasis diagnosis as a binary or multiclass classification problem achieving adequate accuracy (higher than 90%). However, due to their increased complexity (number of layers and free parameters), these networks are severely dependent on the number of available training images that are typically limited within the medical domain. Our study was dedicated to the use of a new deep learning architecture that overcomes the computational burden by using a convolutional neural network with a significantly lower number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and free parameters. The proposed lightweight look-behind fully convolutional neural network was implemented and compared with several well-known powerful CNNs, such as ResNet50, VGG16, Inception V3, Xception, and MobileNet on an imaging dataset of moderate size (778 images from male subjects with prostate cancer). The results prove the superiority of the proposed methodology over the current state-of-the-art on identifying bone metastasis. The proposed methodology demonstrates a unique potential to revolutionize image-based diagnostics enabling new possibilities for enhanced cancer metastasis monitoring and treatment.", "Wireless connectivity is no longer limited to facilitating communications between individuals, but is also required to support diverse and heterogeneous applications, services and infrastructures. Internet of things (IoT) systems will dominate future technologies, allowing any and all devices to create, share and process data. If artificial intelligence resembles the brain of IoT, then high-speed connectivity forms the nervous system that connects the devices. For IoT to safely operate autonomously, it requires highly secure and reliable wireless links. In this article, we shed light on the potential of optical wireless communications to provide high-speed secure and reliable ubiquitous access as an enabler for fifth generation and beyond wireless networks.", "It is unknown how abundant extraterrestrial life is, or whether such life might be complex or intelligent. On Earth, the emergence of complex intelligent life required a preceding series of evolutionary transitions such as abiogenesis, eukaryogenesis, and the evolution of sexual reproduction, multicellularity, and intelligence itself. Some of these transitions could have been extraordinarily improbable, even in conducive environments. The emergence of intelligent life late in Earth's lifetime is thought to be evidence for a handful of rare evolutionary transitions, but the timing of other evolutionary transitions in the fossil record is yet to be analyzed in a similar framework. Using a simplified Bayesian model that combines uninformative priors and the timing of evolutionary transitions, we demonstrate that expected evolutionary transition times likely exceed the lifetime of Earth, perhaps by many orders of magnitude. Our results corroborate the original argument suggested by Brandon Carter that intelligent life in the Universe is exceptionally rare, assuming that intelligent life elsewhere requires analogous evolutionary transitions. Arriving at the opposite conclusion would require exceptionally conservative priors, evidence for much earlier transitions, multiple instances of transitions, or an alternative model that can explain why evolutionary transitions took hundreds of millions of years without appealing to rare chance events. Although the model is simple, it provides an initial basis for evaluating how varying biological assumptions and fossil record data impact the probability of evolving intelligent life, and also provides a number of testable predictions, such as that some biological paradoxes will remain unresolved and that planets orbiting M dwarf stars are uninhabitable.", "The emergence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in early December 2019 has caused immense damage to health and global well-being. Currently, there are approximately five million confirmed cases and the novel virus is still spreading rapidly all over the world. Many hospitals across the globe are not yet equipped with an adequate amount of testing kits and the manual Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test is time-consuming and troublesome. It is hence very important to design an automated and early diagnosis system which can provide fast decision and greatly reduce the diagnosis error. The chest X-ray images along with emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies, in particular Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have recently become a worthy choice for early COVID-19 screening. This paper proposes a DL assisted automated method using X-ray images for early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. We evaluate the effectiveness of eight pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such as AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet, MobileNet-V2, SqueezeNet, ResNet-34, ResNet-50 and Inception-V3 for classification of COVID-19 from normal cases. Also, comparative analyses have been made among these models by considering several important factors such as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, and type of optimizers with an aim to find the best suited model. The models have been validated on publicly available chest X-ray images and the best performance is obtained by ResNet-34 with an accuracy of 98.33%. This study will be useful for researchers to think for the design of more effective CNN based models for early COVID-19 detection.", "Deep learning (DL) is a component or subset of artificial intelligence. DL has contributed significant change in feature extraction and image classification. Various algorithmic models are used in DL such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network, restricted Boltzmann machine, deep belief network and autoencoders. Of these, CNN is the most commonly used algorithm in the field of pathology for feature extraction and building neural network models. DL may be useful for tumour diagnosis, classification of the tumour and grading of the tumour in cytology. In this brief review, the basic concept of the DL and CNN are described. The application, prospects and challenges of the DL in the cytology are also discussed.", "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo worldwide. This review considers recent advances in the diagnosis and management of BPPV including the use of web-based technology and artificial intelligence as well as the evidence supporting the use of vitamin D supplements for patients with BPPV and subnormal serum vitamin D.", "To investigate quantitative differences in fluid volumes between subretinal fluid (SRF)-tolerant and SRF-intolerant treat-and-extend regimens for neovascular age-related macular degeneration and analyze the association with best-corrected visual acuity.\nMacular fluid (SRF and intraretinal fluid) was quantified on optical coherence tomography volumetric scans using a trained and validated deep learning algorithm. Fluid volumes and complete resolution was automatically assessed throughout the study. The impact of fluid location and volumes on best-corrected visual acuity was computed using mixed-effects regression models.\nBaseline fluid quantifications for 348 eyes from 348 patients were balanced (all P > 0.05). No quantitative differences in SRF/intraretinal fluid between the treatment arms was found at any study-specific time point (all P > 0.05). Compared with qualitative assessment, the proportion of eyes without SRF/intraretinal fluid did not differ between the groups at any time point (all P > 0.05). Intraretinal fluid in the central 1 mm and SRF in the 1-mm to 6-mm macular area were negatively associated with best-corrected visual acuity (-2.8 letters/100 nL intraretinal fluid, P = 0.007 and -0.20 letters/100 nL SRF, P = 0.005, respectively).\nAutomated fluid quantification using artificial intelligence allows objective and precise assessment of macular fluid volume and location. Precise determination of fluid parameters will help improve therapeutic efficacy of treatment in neovascular age-related macular degeneration.", "Increased scrutiny of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare highlights the need for real-world evaluations for effectiveness and unintended consequences. The complexity of healthcare, compounded by the user- and context-dependent nature of AI applications, calls for a multifaceted approach beyond traditional in silico evaluation of AI. We propose an interdisciplinary, phased research framework for evaluation of AI implementations in healthcare. We draw analogies to and highlight differences from the clinical trial phases for drugs and medical devices, and we present study design and methodological guidance for each stage.", "Electronically excited states of molecules are at the heart of photochemistry, photophysics, as well as photobiology and also play a role in material science. Their theoretical description requires highly accurate quantum chemical calculations, which are computationally expensive. In this review, we focus on not only how machine learning is employed to speed up such excited-state simulations but also how this branch of artificial intelligence can be used to advance this exciting research field in all its aspects. Discussed applications of machine learning for excited states include excited-state dynamics simulations, static calculations of absorption spectra, as well as many others. In order to put these studies into context, we discuss the promises and pitfalls of the involved machine learning techniques. Since the latter are mostly based on quantum chemistry calculations, we also provide a short introduction into excited-state electronic structure methods and approaches for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and describe tricks and problems when using them in machine learning for excited states of molecules.", "In metal forming, the plastic behavior of metallic alloys is directly related to their formability, and it has been traditionally characterized by simplified models of the flow curves, especially in the analysis by finite element simulation and analytical methods. Tools based on artificial neural networks have shown high potential for predicting the behavior and properties of industrial components. Aluminum alloys are among the most broadly used materials in challenging industries such as aerospace, automotive, or food packaging. In this study, a computer-aided tool is developed to predict two of the most useful mechanical properties of metallic materials to characterize the plastic behavior, yield strength and ultimate tensile strength. These prognostics are based on the alloy chemical composition, tempers, and Brinell hardness. In this study, a material database is employed to train an artificial neural network that is able to make predictions with a confidence greater than 95%. It is also shown that this methodology achieves a performance similar to that of empirical equations developed expressly for a specific material, but it provides greater generality since it can approximate the properties of any aluminum alloy. The methodology is based on the usage of artificial neural networks supported by a big data collection about the properties of thousands of commercial materials. Thus, the input data go above 2000 entries. When the relevant information has been collected and organized, an artificial neural network is defined, and after the training, the artificial intelligence is able to make predictions about the material properties with an average confidence greater than 95%.", "The lockdown measures of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have disengaged patients with cancer from formal health care settings, leading to an increased use of social media platforms to address unmet needs and expectations. Although remote health technologies have addressed some of the medical needs, the emotional and mental well-being of these patients remain underexplored and underreported. We used a validated artificial intelligence framework to conduct a comprehensive real-time analysis of two data sets of 2,469,822 tweets and 21,800 discussions by patients with cancer during this pandemic. Lung and breast cancer are most prominently discussed, and the most concerns were expressed regarding delayed diagnosis, cancellations, missed treatments, and weakened immunity. All patients expressed significant negative sentiment, with fear being the predominant emotion. Even as some lockdown measures ease, it is crucial that patients with cancer are engaged using social media platforms for real-time identification of issues and the provision of informational and emotional support.", "The people with Down syndrome who are now adolescents can face a self-report questionnaire with guarantees of being answered with validity to evaluate areas of development that traditionally have not been able to be evaluated. This is the case of emotional intelligence, measured in this research with the Emotional Quotient Inventory: Youth Version-EQ-i:YV.\nTo validate and analyse the scale's psychometric properties in adolescents with Down syndrome.\nA two-stage cross-sectional investigation was conducted. The inventory consists of 60 items that measure 5 dimensions. The test was administered to 644 adolescents with Down syndrome. We carried out exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.\nThe 5-factor structure of the test was confirmed. The internal consistency of four dimensions and the EQ-i:YV's total calculated score yielded high values.\nThis new version of the EQ-i:YV represents a valid and reliable tool to assess emotional intelligence in Spanish adolescents with Down syndrome.", "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects an estimated 463 million people worldwide. Aiming to improve the treatment of people with diabetes, digital health has been widely adopted in recent years and generated a huge amount of data that could be used for further management of this chronic disease. Taking advantage of this, approaches that use artificial intelligence and specifically deep learning, an emerging type of machine learning, have been widely adopted with promising results. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the applications of deep learning within the field of diabetes. We conducted a systematic literature search and identified three main areas that use this approach: diagnosis of diabetes, glucose management, and diagnosis of diabetes-related complications. The search resulted in the selection of 40 original research articles, of which we have summarized the key information about the employed learning models, development process, main outcomes, and baseline methods for performance evaluation. Among the analyzed literature, it is to be noted that various deep learning techniques and frameworks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many diabetes-related tasks by outperforming conventional machine learning approaches. Meanwhile, we identify some limitations in the current literature, such as a lack of data availability and model interpretability. The rapid developments in deep learning and the increase in available data offer the possibility to meet these challenges in the near future and allow the widespread deployment of this technology in clinical settings.", "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been found to be useful to physicians in the field of image recognition due to three elements: deep learning (that is, CNN, convolutional neural network), a high-performance computer, and a large amount of digitized data. In the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy, Japanese endoscopists have produced the world's first achievements of CNN-based AI system for detecting gastric and esophageal cancers. This study reviews papers on CNN-based AI for gastrointestinal cancers, and discusses the future of this technology in clinical practice. Employing AI-based endoscopes would enable early cancer detection. The better diagnostic abilities of AI technology may be beneficial in early gastrointestinal cancers in which endoscopists have variable diagnostic abilities and accuracy. AI coupled with the expertise of endoscopists would increase the accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis.", "Risk calculators are an underused tool for surgeons and trainees when determining and communicating surgical risk. We summarize some of the more common risk calculators and discuss their evolution and limitations. We also describe artificial intelligence models, which have the potential to help clinicians better understand and use risk assessment.", "Capsule endoscopy is ideally suited to artificial intelligence-based interpretation given its reliance on pattern recognition in still images. Time saving viewing modes and lesion detection features currently available rely on machine learning algorithms, a form of artificial intelligence. Current software necessitates close human supervision given poor sensitivity relative to an expert reader. However, with the advent of deep learning, artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly reliable and will be increasingly relied upon. We review the major advances in artificial intelligence for capsule endoscopy in recent publications and briefly review artificial intelligence development for historical understanding. Importantly, recent advancements in artificial intelligence have not yet been incorporated into practice and it is immature to judge the potential of this technology based on current platforms. Remaining regulatory and standardization hurdles are being overcome and artificial intelligence-based clinical applications are likely to proliferate rapidly.", "Any first step in organisational adaptation starts with individuals' responses and willingness (or otherwise) to change an aspect of themselves given the transcontextual settings in which they are operating (Bateson in Small arcs of larger circles: framing through other patterns, Triarchy Press, Axminster, 2018). This research explores the implications for organisational adaptation strategies when Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being embedded into the ecology of the organisation, and when employees have a dominant fixed or growth mindset (Dweck in Mindset: changing the way you think to fulfil your potential. Robinson, London, 2017). Research participants were supplied with a single scenario based in 2030, where-as a result of Artificial Intelligence technology implementation-employees were going to be displaced. Using Torbert's (Organizational wisdom and executive courage, New Lexington Press, San Francisco, 1998) 'first, second and third person' research theory, participants were asked to independently review their thoughts, sense, and image of the future from a fixed mindset position (considered to be the worst case), then from a growth mindset perspective (best case), and then do the same collectively. Five key findings are outlined which support the principle that having a growth mindset is a key component of adaptive capacity and futures literacy. The five key findings conclude that AI adaptation processes need to include compassion and authenticity, embodiment, fundamental needs and motivations, mutual learning and considering what lies beyond the edges of the organisation (Bateson in Small arcs of larger circles: framing through other patterns, Triarchy Press, Axminster, 2018).", "The aim of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence tool to assess echocardiographic image quality objectively.\nLeft ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) has recently been used to monitor cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) but image quality limits its reliability.\nA DenseNet-121 convolutional neural network was developed for view identification from an athlete's echocardiographic dataset. To prove the concept that classification confidence (CC) can serve as a quality marker, values of longitudinal strain derived from feature tracking of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and strain analysis of echocardiography were compared. The CC was then applied to patients with breast cancer free from CTRCD to investigate the effects of image quality on the reliability of strain analysis.\nCC of the apical 4-chamber view (A4C) was significantly correlated with the endocardial border delineation index. CC of A4C >900 significantly predicted a\u00a0<15% relative difference in longitudinal strain between CMR feature tracking and automated echocardiographic analysis. Echocardiographic studies (n =752) of 102 patients with breast cancer without CTRCD were investigated. The strain analysis showed higher parallel forms, inter-rater, and test-retest reliabilities in patients with CC of A4C >900. During sequential comparisons of automated LVGLS in individual patients, those with CC of A4C >900 had a lower false positive detection rate of CTRCD.\nCC of A4C was associated with the reliability of automated LVGLS and could also potentially be used as a filter to select comparable images from sequential echocardiographic studies in individual patients and reduce the false\u00a0positive detection rate of CTRCD.", "Depression has become a growing health issue in the world and is projected to become a leading cause of global burden. However, there is little scientific research on the factors associated with depression in people with disabilities in China. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to explore the prevalence and related factors of depression among people with disabilities in communities in mainland China.Participants with disability certificates were recruited via face-to-face interviews to complete questionnaires. Contents include participants' demographic characteristics, the Modified Barthel Index (MBI), chronic medical history, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).A total of 1815 participants (M age\u200a=\u200a60.35\u200a\u00b1\u200a13.66) whose questionnaires are eligible were finally included. Among them the incidence rate of depressive symptoms was up to 39.9%. Multifactor regression analysis showed that grade I disability (odds ratio (OR)\u200a=\u200a1.37, P\u200a<\u200a.05), impairment activities of daily living (OR\u200a=\u200a3.23, P\u200a<\u200a.001), diabetes (OR\u200a=\u200a1.43, P\u200a<\u200a.05), and hyperlipidemia (OR\u200a=\u200a1.59, P\u200a<\u200a.001) were associated with depression in the disabled. However, intelligence disability is a protective factor of depression (OR\u200a=\u200a0.69, P\u200a<\u200a.05).The data demonstrates that the depression of the disabled should arouse the attention of our society. Furthermore, the interventions to disability degree, impairment activities of daily living, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia may help to improve the mental health of the disabled people.", "Introduction: The practice of medicine is characterized by decision making in which digital techniques can provide good support. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important. The challenge for physicians, however, is to maintain an overview of the potential applications and usefulness of AI in order to be able to apply it efficiently and safely in their work. Therefore, appropriate skills must be imparted during the course of medical studies so that future practitioners can meet this requirement. Project description: The interdisciplinary research-related teaching and learning project \"(Natural) Science and Technology in Medicine - NWTmed\" brings together students at the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (JLU) from the fields of medicine and other (natural) scientific disciplines in structured courses with the aim of thinking, learning, and working in an interdisciplinary and research-oriented manner already during their medical education. With the involvement of local researchers, a \"multi-disciplinary\" seminar on the basic premises, methods, and applications of AI was established. Results: The participants of the course came from a wide variety of fields of study, which promoted an interdisciplinary exchange and animated discussions. A gain in knowledge and an increase in interest in the topic of AI was noted in the evaluations, and a willingness on the part of the students to pursue further independent study was also expressed. Discussion and conclusion: The topic of AI and its relevance to the field of medicine is not yet sufficiently represented in medical education. It will require integration in the curriculum and performance evaluations as well as interdisciplinary and research-related teaching formats.\nEinleitung: Die \u00e4rztliche Arbeit ist gepr\u00e4gt vom Treffen von Entscheidungen, bei welchen digitale Techniken eine gute Unterst\u00fctzung bieten k\u00f6nnen.

AI-based screening triage may help identify normal examinations and AI-based computer-aided detection (AI-CAD) may increase cancer detection and reduce false positives. Risk assessment, quality assurance, and other workflow tasks may also be streamlined. AI adoption will depend on robust evidence of improved quality, increased efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Reliance on AI will likely proceed through stages and will involve careful attention to its limitations to prevent overconfidence in its application.", "This addendum expands upon the arguments made in the author's 2020 essay, \"Legal Personhood for Artificial Intelligence: Citizenship as the Exception to the Rule\", in an effort to display the significance human augmentation technologies will have on (feasibly) inadvertently providing legal protections to artificial intelligence systems (AIS)-a topic only briefly addressed in that work. It will also further discuss the impacts popular media have on imprinting notions of computerised behaviour and its subsequent consequences on the attribution of legal protections to AIS and on speculative technological advancement that would aid the sophistication of AIS.", "The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) requires the exclusion of other diseases using various methods. However, it is difficult to differentiate these diseases based only on clinical symptoms, and information regarding responses to drugs and several imaging examinations are often needed for a diagnosis. In recent years, various neurological signs and symptoms have been reported that are particularly useful in neurological examinations for differentiating PD, progressive supranuclear palsy, and multiple system atrophy. Currently, diagnosis using imaging techniques and artificial intelligence are being developed, but systematic neurological examinations will continue to be important in diagnosing these diseases.", "Estimating premorbid cognitive ability is an essential part of assessment as well as being an important consideration in research. The most widely used approach to premorbid assessment, The National Adult Reading Test (NART), relies on word reading ability. However, this can be problematic in patients where communication is impaired. This research assessed the effectiveness of a receptive vocabulary test, the British Picture Vocabulary Scale II (BPVS) as an alternative. Correlations were found between the BPVS, NART and the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) in 87 healthy participants. Regression equations were calculated relating NART and BPVS raw scores to IQ scores in the healthy sample. WASI, NART and BPVS scores were also obtained in 19 patients with varying neurological etiology as part of their routine assessment. Results showed that 18 out of 19 patients obtained BPVS derived IQ scores similar to or higher than their WASI IQ. Whereas mean BPVS derived IQ did not differ significantly between the standardization and clinical samples, WASI IQ scores were lower in the patient group. The findings suggest that the BPVS II 'holds' after acquired cognitive impairment and is a promising alternative method for estimating premorbid IQ in patients who have difficulties reading or verbalizing.", "Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a sight-threatening condition that needs regular examinations and remedies. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most common used examination to evaluate the structure and thickness of the macula, but the software in the OCT machine does not tell the clinicians whether DME exists directly. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to aid in diagnosis generation and therapy selection. We thus develop a smartphone-based offline AI system that provides diagnostic suggestions and medical strategies through analyzing OCT images from diabetic patients at the risk of developing DME.\nDME patients receiving treatments in 2017 at Taipei Veterans General Hospital were included in this study. We retrospectively collected the OCT images of these patients from January 2008 to July 2018. We established the AI model based on MobileNet architecture to classify the OCT images conditions. The confusion matrix has been applied to present the performance of the trained AI model.\nBased on the convolutional neural network with the MobileNet model, our AI system achieved a high DME diagnostic accuracy of 90.02%, which is comparable to other AI systems such as InceptionV3 and VGG16. We further developed a mobile-application based on this AI model available at https://aicl.ddns.net/DME.apk.\nWe successful integrated an AI model into the mobile device to provide an offline method to provide the diagnosis for quickly screening the risk of developing DME. With the offline property, our model could help those nonophthalmological healthcare providers in offshore islands or underdeveloped countries.", "The aim is to evaluate whether smart worklist prioritization by artificial intelligence (AI) can optimize the radiology workflow and reduce report turnaround times (RTATs) for critical findings in chest radiographs (CXRs). Furthermore, we investigate a method to counteract the effect of false negative predictions by AI-resulting in an extremely and dangerously long RTAT, as CXRs are sorted to the end of the worklist.\nWe developed a simulation framework that models the current workflow at a university hospital by incorporating hospital-specific CXR generation rates and reporting rates and pathology distribution. Using this, we simulated the standard worklist processing \"first-in, first-out\" (FIFO) and compared it with a worklist prioritization based on urgency. Examination prioritization was performed by the AI, classifying eight different pathological findings ranked in descending order of urgency: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, infiltrate, congestion, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, mass, and foreign object. Furthermore, we introduced an upper limit for the maximum waiting time, after which the highest urgency is assigned to the examination.\nThe average RTAT for all critical findings was significantly reduced in all prioritization simulations compared to the FIFO simulation (e.g., pneumothorax: 35.6\u00a0min vs. 80.1\u00a0min; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), while the maximum RTAT for most findings increased at the same time (e.g., pneumothorax: 1293\u00a0min vs 890\u00a0min; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Our \"upper limit\" substantially reduced the maximum RTAT in all classes (e.g., pneumothorax: 979\u00a0min vs. 1293\u00a0min/1178\u00a0min; p\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nOur simulations demonstrate that smart worklist prioritization by AI can reduce the average RTAT for critical findings in CXRs while maintaining a small maximum RTAT as FIFO.\n\u2022 Development of a realistic clinical workflow simulator based on empirical data from a hospital allowed precise assessment of smart worklist prioritization using artificial intelligence. \u2022 Employing a smart worklist prioritization without a threshold for maximum waiting time runs the risk of false negative predictions of the artificial intelligence greatly increasing the report turnaround time. \u2022 Use of a state-of-the-art convolution neural network can reduce the average report turnaround time almost to the upper limit of a perfect classification algorithm (e.g., pneumothorax: 35.6\u00a0min vs. 30.4\u00a0min).", "Many spectra have a polynomial-like baseline. Iterative polynomial fitting is one of the most popular methods for baseline correction of these spectra. However, the baseline estimated by iterative polynomial fitting may have a substantial error when the spectrum contains significantly strong peaks or have strong peaks located at the endpoints. First, iterative polynomial fitting uses temporary baseline estimated from the current spectrum to identify peak data points. If the current spectrum contains strong peaks, then the temporary baseline substantially deviates from the true baseline. Some good baseline data points of the spectrum might be mistakenly identified as peak data points and are artificially re-assigned with a low value. Second, if a strong peak is located at the endpoint of the spectrum, then the endpoint region of the estimated baseline might have a significant error due to overfitting. This study proposes a search algorithm-based baseline correction method (SA) that aims to compress sample the raw spectrum to a dataset with small number of data points and then convert the peak removal process into solving a search problem in artificial intelligence to minimize an objective function by deleting peak data points. First, the raw spectrum is smoothened out by the moving average method to reduce noise and then divided into dozens of unequally spaced sections on the basis of Chebyshev nodes. Finally, the minimal points of each section are collected to form a dataset for peak removal through search algorithm. SA selects the mean absolute error as the objective function because of its sensitivity to overfitting and rapid calculation. The baseline correction performance of SA is compared with those of three baseline correction methods, the Lieber and Mahadevan-Jansen method, adaptive iteratively reweighted penalized least squares method, and improved asymmetric least squares method. Simulated and real Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectra with polynomial-like baselines are employed in the experiments. Results show that for these spectra the baseline estimated by SA has fewer error than those by the three other methods.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful set of tools for engineering innovative materials. However, the AI-aided design of materials textures has not yet been researched in depth. In order to explore the potentials of AI for discovering innovative biointerfaces and engineering materials surfaces, especially for biomedical applications, this study focuses on the control of wettability through design-controlled hierarchical surfaces, whose design is supported and its performance predicted thanks to adequately structured and trained artificial neural networks (ANN). The authors explain the creation of a comprehensive library of microtextured surfaces with well-known wettability properties. Such a library is processed and employed for the generation and training of artificial neural networks, which can predict the actual wetting performance of new design biointerfaces. The present research demonstrates that AI can importantly support the engineering of innovative hierarchical or multiscale surfaces when complex-to-model properties and phenomena, such as wettability and wetting, are involved.", "Epigenetics is a field of biological sciences focused on the study of reversible, heritable changes in gene function, not due to modifications of the genomic sequence. These changes are the result of a complex cross-talk between several molecular mechanisms that is in turn orchestrated by genetic and environmental factors. The epigenetic profile captures the unique regulatory landscape and the exposure to environmental stimuli of an individual. It thus constitutes a valuable reservoir of information for personalized medicine, which is aimed at customizing health-care interventions based on the unique characteristics of each individual. Nowadays, the complex milieu of epigenomic marks can be studied at the genome-wide level thanks to massive, high-throughput technologies. This new experimental approach is opening up new and interesting knowledge perspectives. However, the analysis of these complex omic data requires to face important analytic issues. Artificial Intelligence, and in particular Machine Learning, are emerging as powerful resources to decipher epigenomic data. In this review, we will first describe the most used ML approaches in epigenomics. We then will recapitulate some of the recent applications of ML to epigenomic analysis. Finally, we will provide some examples of how the ML approach to epigenetic data can be useful for personalized medicine.", "To assess the relationship of smoking (cigarettes or waterpipe), alcohol drinking, alexithymia, self-esteem, anxiety, depression, stress, social phobia, emotional intelligence, impulsivity, insomnia, physical health, and loneliness with problematic social media use (PSMU) in a sample of Lebanese citizens.\nThis cross-sectional study enrolled 466 participants (January-May 2019).\nHigher anxiety, alcohol use disorder, and social phobia were correlated with elevated PSMU, while older age was associated with lower PSMU. Emotional intelligence partially mediated the association between alexithymia and PSMU by 4.55%.\nSince these manifestations are preventable, spreading awareness through our schools, educational programs, and even healthcare professionals would considerably reduce the pace at which young adults are transforming into anxious and distorted individuals.", "Cognitive impairment is an important\u00a0comorbidity\u00a0of refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We aimed to explore the impact of (i) specific lesions, such as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET), dysplasia, or hippocampal sclerosis, (ii) focus localization (medial versus lateral) and (iii) focus lateralization (right versus left) on the neuropsychological profile of refractory TLE adult patients.\nWe examined the neuropsychological characteristics of 312 adults with refractory TLE: 100 patients without hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and 212 with HS. Scores on tests of intelligence (Global IQ, Verbal IQ and Performance IQ), working memory, episodic memory (verbal and visual learning and forgetting), executive functions and language abilities were analyzed.\nThree main factors influenced the neuropsychological profile of refractory TLE patients: (i) the lesion, patients with HS obtaining poorer cognitive performances than patients without HS and specifically DNET patients performing better than patients with HS, (ii) the focus side, that seems only relevant for verbal memory abilities which are affected in left but not right TLE patients and (iii) the localization of seizure focus, patients with medial TLE exhibiting lower memory performances than patients with lateral TLE.\nLesion, localization and lateralization are major contributors of the cognitive impairment depicted in TLE. Hippocampal sclerosis appears as the main contributor.", "Early detection strategies and improvements in cancer treatment have dramatically reduced the cancer mortality rate in the United States (US). However, cardiovascular (CV) side effects of cancer therapy are frequent among the 17 million cancer survivors in the US today, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer survivors. Circulating biomarkers are ideal for detecting and monitoring CV side effects of cancer therapy. Here, we summarize the current state of clinical studies on conventional serum and plasma CVD biomarkers to detect and prevent cardiac injury during cancer treatment. We also review how novel exploratory tools such as genetic testing, human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, Omics technologies, and artificial intelligence can elucidate underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms of CV injury and to improve predicting cancer therapy-related cardiotoxicity (CTRC). Current regulatory requirements for biomarker qualifications are also addressed. We present generally applicable lessons learned from published studies, particularly on how to improve reproducibility. The combination of conventional circulating biomarkers and novel exploratory tools will pave the way for precision medicine and improve the clinical practice of prediction, detection, and management of CTRC.", "The dataset presented in this article pertains to records of shield tunneling-induced ground settlements in Guangzhou Metro Line No. 9. Field monitoring results obtained from both the two tunnel lines are put on display. In total, 17 principal variables affecting ground settlements are tabulated, which can be divided into two categories: geological condition parameters and shield operation parameters. Shield operation parameters are specifically provided in time series. Another value of the dataset is the consideration of karst encountered in the shield tunnel area including the karst cave height, the distance between karst cave and tunnel invert, and the karst cave treatment scheme. The dataset can be used to enrich the database of settlement caused by shield tunneling as well as to train artificial intelligence-based ground settlement prediction models. The dataset presented herein were used for the article titled \"Evolutionary hybrid neural network approach to predict shield tunneling-induced ground settlements\" (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020).", "Describe an augmented intelligence approach to facilitate the update of evidence for associations in knowledge graphs.\nNew publications are filtered through multiple machine learning study classifiers, and filtered publications are combined with articles already included as evidence in the knowledge graph. The corpus is then subjected to named entity recognition, semantic dictionary mapping, term vector space modeling, pairwise similarity, and focal entity match to identify highly related publications. Subject matter experts review recommended articles to assess inclusion in the knowledge graph; discrepancies are resolved by consensus.\nStudy classifiers achieved F-scores from 0.88 to 0.94, and similarity thresholds for each study type were determined by experimentation. Our approach reduces human literature review load by 99%, and over the past 12 months, 41% of recommendations were accepted to update the knowledge graph.\nIntegrated search and recommendation exploiting current evidence in a knowledge graph is useful for reducing human cognition load.", "This study investigated the outcomes of multiple mini interviews and personal interview on personality traits, emotional intelligence, perceived educational environment, and stressors.\nThis is a comparative cross-sectional study on two cohorts of pre-clinical medical students who were selected by multiple mini interviews and personal interview, respectively. Their personality traits, emotional intelligence, perceived educational environment, and perceived stressors were measured using different measurement tools.\nMultiple mini interviews and personal interview demonstrated a similar ability to recruit medical students with a high level of emotional intelligence. The main advantage of personal interviews over multiple mini interviews in terms of personality traits is that it recruited candidates who had a higher level of conscientiousness trait. The main advantage of multiple mini interviews over personal interview on the educational environment is that medical students chosen by multiple mini interviews had a higher level of satisfaction with social aspects of medical training. Regardless of admission processes, the medical students were equally vulnerable to psychological distress due to various stressful events throughout medical training particularly related to academic loads.\nThis study provided evidence to support the outcomes that multiple mini interviews and personal interview have on medical students' emotional intelligence, personality traits, perceived educational environment, and perceived stressors during the pre-clinical medical training. Interestingly, personal interview had a better outcome on conscientiousness while multiple mini interviews had a better outcome on the social aspect.", "Nowadays, COVID-19 is spreading at a rapid rate in almost all the continents of the world. It has already affected many people who are further spreading it day by day. Hence, it is the most essential to alert nearby people to be aware of it due to its communicable behavior. Till May 2020, no vaccine is available for the treatment of this COVID-19, but the existing technologies can be used to minimize its effect. Cloud/fog computing could be used to monitor and control this rapidly spreading infection in a cost-effective and time-saving manner. To strengthen COVID-19 patient prediction, Artificial Intelligence(AI) can be integrated with cloud/fog computing for practical solutions. In this paper, fog assisted the internet of things based quality of service framework is presented to prevent and protect from COVID-19. It provides real-time processing of users' health data to predict the COVID-19 infection by observing their symptoms and immediately generates an emergency alert, medical reports, and significant precautions to the user, their guardian as well as doctors/experts. It collects sensitive information from the hospitals/quarantine shelters through the patient IoT devices for taking necessary actions/decisions. Further, it generates an alert message to the government health agencies for controlling the outbreak of chronic illness and for tanking quick and timely actions.", "Driven by the global increase in the size and median age of the world population, sight loss is becoming a major public health challenge. Furthermore, the increased survival of premature neonates in low- and middle-income countries is causing an increase in developmental paediatric ophthalmic disease. Finally, there is an ongoing change in health-seeking behaviour worldwide, with consequent demand for increased access to healthcare, including ophthalmology. There is therefore the need to maximise the reach of resource-limited ophthalmology expertise in the context of increasing demand. Yet, ophthalmic diagnostics critically relies on visualisation, through optical imaging, of the front and of the back of the eye, and teleophthalmology, the remote visualisation of diagnostic images, shows promise to offer a viable solution.In this chapter, we first explore the strategies at the core of teleophthalmology and, in particular, real-time vs store-and-forward remote visualisation techniques, including considerations on suitability for different tasks and environments. We then introduce the key technologies suitable for teleophthalmology: anterior segment imaging, posterior segment imaging (retinal imaging) and, briefly, radiographic/tomographic techniques. We highlight enabling factors, such as high-resolution handheld imaging, high data rate mobile transmission, cloud storage and computing, 3D printing and other rapid fabrication technologies and patient and healthcare system acceptance of remote consultations. We then briefly discuss four canonical implementation settings, namely, national service provision integration, field and community screening, optometric decision support and virtual clinics, giving representative examples. We conclude with considerations on the outlook of the field, in particular, on artificial intelligence and on robotic actuation of the patient end point as a complement to televisualisation.", "Ultramarathons are becoming an increasingly popular endurance sport. Year after year, the demands on athletes' skills and endurance increase. Ultramarathons are particularly taxing on athletes' psychological functioning. This study assessed the relationships between taking part in a nighttime ultramarathon and changes in mood and cognitive functioning. The study included 20 experienced runners aged 26-57 (M = 37.29; SD = 7.94) who had M = 7.08, SD = 5.41 (range 3-44) years of experience running. There were 18 men and 2 women. The mood states were measured twice, just before the start of the run and shortly after crossing the finish line, using the Polish version of the UMACL UWIST Mood Adjective Checklist by Mathews, Chamberlain, and Jones. To assess cognitive functioning, the Stroop Color and Word Test and \"Forward digit span\" subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale were used. We observed statistically significant changes in the mood of the runners: tense arousal, associated with the experienced stress, was significantly higher before the run than immediately after the finish. Moreover, we observed an improvement in cognitive functioning after finishing the 100 km run on both of the trials on the Stroop color word test and on the forward digit span test.", "The concept of emotional intelligence has gained great popularity in the last few decades. With significant rise in stress and other emotional disturbances among students, it becomes necessary to determine whether high emotional intelligence could help manage perceived stress better. This study aims to assess emotional intelligence and perceived stress among undergraduate students of Arts and Science colleges, to determine the association of emotional intelligence with perceived stress, academic performance, and selected socio-demographic factors.\nUsing multistage sampling, 720 students aged 18 years and above were selected from four colleges in Puducherry. Emotional intelligence and perceived stress were assessed using standard self-administered questionnaires \"The Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SEIT)\" and \"Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14),\" respectively.\nThe median (IQR) Emotional Intelligence score and Perceived Stress score were 127 (114-137) and 43 (39-47), respectively. The study was not able to establish a significant association between emotional intelligence and perceived stress. A weak significant correlation existed between emotional intelligence and academic performance. Multiple variable analysis revealed gender, year of study, volunteering with youth organizations, and mother's occupation to be significantly associated with emotional intelligence (p < 0.05).\nWomen, final year students and those who volunteered with youth organizations had higher emotional intelligence. Children of mothers who were employed in knowledge-intensive occupations were more emotionally intelligent. Academic performance had a weak positive significant correlation with emotional intelligence.", "This study examined the factorial structure of the Polish version of the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA-PL) and its relation with other variables, previously shown to be antecedents or outcomes of parental burnout. The PBA-PL was administered to a total sample of 2,130 parents along with other instruments depending on the study. Factorial analyses of the PBA-PL supported both the original four-factor model of parental burnout (exhaustion related to parenting, feelings of being fed up with parenting, emotional distancing from one's children, and contrast with previous parental self) and a second-order model with a global parental burnout underlying the four first-order factors. Both subscale and global scores were reliable. Significant correlations were found between PBA-PL and neuroticism, emotional intelligence, maladaptive perfectionism, perceived social support, depressive symptoms, marital satisfaction, and life satisfaction. PBA-PL also predicted both parental neglect and parental violence beyond socio-demographic factors, depression, and job burnout.", "Long-term sequelae of cancer and its treatment render childhood cancer (CC) survivors vulnerable to cognitive and behavioural difficulties and likely affect their quality of life (QoL). Our aim was to compare levels of cognition, psychosocial functioning, and health-related QoL of CC survivors to healthy controls and examine the associations between these three domains. Seventy-eight CC survivors (age range\u2009=\u20097-16 years,\u2009\u2265\u2009one year since cancer treatment) and 56 healthy controls were included. Cognition (i.e., fluid intelligence, executive functions, memory, processing speed, and selective attention), psychosocial functioning, and health-related QoL were assessed using standardized tests and questionnaires. The cognitive performance, parent-reported psychosocial behaviour, and health-related QoL of the CC survivors were within the normative range. However, working memory was significantly poorer in survivors than controls, and visuospatial working memory below the normative range was more commonly observed among survivors than among controls. Processing speed significantly predicted survivors' performance in executive functions. Among survivors, greater peer problems were significantly associated with poorer cognitive functions and health-related QoL. Despite the evidence for good intellectual functioning, which might point towards adequate reserves, in some survivors, domain-specific difficulties may emerge years after cancer relating to psychosocial development and QoL.", "Histology, the branch of anatomy also known as microscopic anatomy, is the study of the structure and function of the body's tissues. To gain an understanding of the tissues of the body is to learn the foundational underpinnings of anatomy and achieve a deeper, more intimate insight into how the body is constructed, functions, and undergoes pathological change. Histology, therefore, is an integral element of basic science education within today's medical curricula. Its development as a discipline is inextricably linked to the evolution of the technology that allows us to visualize it. This chapter takes us on the journey through the past, present, and future of histology and its education; from technologies grounded in ancient understanding and control of the properties of light, to the ingenuity of crafting glass lenses that led to the construction of the first microscopes; traversing the second revolution in histology through the development of modern histological techniques and methods of digital and virtual microscopy, which allows learners to visualize histology anywhere, at any time; to the future of histology that allows flexible self-directed learning through social media, live-streaming, and virtual reality as a result of the powerful smart technologies we all carry around in our pockets. But, is our continuous pursuit of technological advancement projecting us towards a dystopian world where machines with artificial intelligence learn how to read histological slides and diagnose the diseases in the very humans that built them?", "The surge of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine stands on a lengthy, and frequently reticent, buildout [...].", "With the advent of electronic medical records and digitalization of health care over the past 2\u00a0decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as an enabling tool to manage complex datasets and deliver streamlined data-driven patient care. AI algorithms have the ability to extract meaningful signal from complex datasets through an iterative process akin to human learning. Through advancements over the past decade in deep learning, AI-driven innovations have accelerated applications in health care. Herein, the authors explore the development of these emerging AI technologies, focusing on the application of AI to endourology and robotic surgery.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in pattern recognition and positioning. In most of the geological exploration applications, it needs to locate and identify underground objects according to electromagnetic wave characteristics from the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images. Currently, a few robust AI approach can detect targets by real-time with high precision or automation for GPR images recognition. This paper proposes an approach that can be used to identify parabolic targets with different sizes and underground soil or concrete structure voids based on you only look once (YOLO) v3. With the TensorFlow 1.13.0 developed by Google, we construct YOLO v3 neural network to realize real-time pattern recognition of GPR images. We propose the specific coding method for the GPR image samples in Yolo V3 to improve the prediction accuracy of bounding boxes. At the same time, K-means algorithm is also applied to select anchor boxes to improve the accuracy of positioning hyperbolic vertex. For some instances electromagnetic-vacillated signals may occur, which refers to multiple parabolic electromagnetic waves formed by strong conductive objects among soils or overlapping waveforms. This paper deals with the vacillating signal similarity intersection over union (IoU) (V-IoU) methods. Experimental result shows that the V-IoU combined with non-maximum suppression (NMS) can accurately frame targets in GPR image and reduce the misidentified boxes as well. Compared with the single shot multi-box detector (SSD), YOLO v2, and Faster-RCNN, the V-IoU YOLO v3 shows its superior performance even when implemented by CPU. It can meet the real-time output requirements by an average 12 fps detected speed. In summary, this paper proposes a simple and high-precision real-time pattern recognition method for GPR imagery, and promoted the application of artificial intelligence or deep learning in the field of the geophysical science.", "Digital pathology is on the verge of becoming a mainstream option for routine diagnostics. Faster whole slide image scanning has paved the way for this development, but implementation on a large scale is challenging on technical, logistical, and financial levels. Comparative studies have published reassuring data on safety and feasibility, but implementation experiences highlight the need for training and the knowledge of pitfalls. Up to half of the pathologists are reluctant to sign out reports on only digital slides and are concerned about reporting without the tool that has represented their profession since its beginning. Guidelines by international pathology organizations aim to safeguard histology in the digital realm, from image acquisition over the setup of work-stations to long-term image archiving, but must be considered a starting point only. Cost-efficiency analyses and occupational health issues need to be addressed comprehensively. Image analysis is blended into the traditional work-flow, and the approval of artificial intelligence for routine diagnostics starts to challenge human evaluation as the gold standard. Here we discuss experiences from past digital pathology implementations, future possibilities through the addition of artificial intelligence, technical and occupational health challenges, and possible changes to the pathologist's profession.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology has improved diagnostic performance and shortened reading times of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients' studies.\nThe objectives pf the study were to analyze the performance of a chest computed tomography (CT) AI quantitative algorithm for determining the risk of mortality/mechanical ventilation (MV) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and explore a prognostic multivariate model in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City.\nChest CT images of 166 COVID-19 patients hospitalized from April 1 to 20, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed using AI algorithm software. Data were collected from their medical records. We analyzed the diagnostic yield of the relevant CT variables using the area under the ROC curve (area under the curve [AUC]). Optimal thresholds were obtained using the Youden index. We proposed a predictive logistic model for each outcome based on CT AI measures and predetermined laboratory and clinical characteristics.\nThe highest diagnostic yield of the assessed CT variables for mortality was the percentage of total opacity (threshold >51%; AUC = 0.88, sensitivity = 74%, and specificity = 91%). The AUC of the CT severity score (threshold > 12.5) was 0.88 for MV (sensitivity = 65% and specificity = 92%). The proposed prognostic models include the percentage of opacity and lactate dehydrogenase level for mortality and troponin I and CT severity score for MV requirement.\nThe AI-calculated CT severity score and total opacity percentage showed good diagnostic accuracy for mortality and met MV criteria. The proposed prognostic models using biochemical variables and imaging data measured by AI on chest CT showed good risk classification in our population of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.", "Accurate diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is crucial to ensure that patients receive timely treatment. We hypothesized that application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the chest X-ray (CXR) could identify elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and stratify the risk of heart failure hospitalization with PH. We retrospectively enrolled a total of 900 consecutive patients with suspected PH. We trained a convolutional neural network to identify patients with elevated PAP (>\u200920\u00a0mmHg) as the actual value of PAP. The endpoints in this study were admission or occurrence of heart failure with elevated PAP. In an independent evaluation set for detection of elevated PAP, the area under curve (AUC) by the AI algorithm was significantly higher than the AUC by measurements of CXR images and human observers (0.71 vs. 0.60 and vs. 0.63, all p\u2009<\u20090.05). In patients with AI predicted PH had 2-times the risk of heart failure with PH compared with those without AI predicted PH. This preliminary work suggests that applying AI to the CXR in high risk groups has limited performance when used alone in identifying elevated PAP. We believe that this report can serve as an impetus for a future large study.", "Childhood lead exposure has been linked to disrupted brain development, but long-term consequences for structural brain integrity are unknown.\nTo test the hypothesis that childhood lead exposure is associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of lower structural integrity of the brain in midlife.\nThe Dunedin Study followed a population-representative 1972-1973 birth cohort in New Zealand (N\u2009=\u2009564 analytic sample) to age 45 years (until April 2019).\nChildhood blood lead levels measured at age 11 years.\nStructural brain integrity at age 45 years assessed via MRI (primary outcomes): gray matter (cortical thickness, surface area, hippocampal volume), white matter (white matter hyperintensities, fractional anisotropy [theoretical range, 0 {diffusion is perfectly isotropic} to 100 {diffusion is perfectly anisotropic}]), and the Brain Age Gap Estimation (BrainAGE), a composite index of the gap between chronological age and a machine learning algorithm-estimated brain age (0 indicates a brain age equivalent to chronological age; positive and negative values represent an older and younger brain age, respectively). Cognitive function at age 45 years was assessed objectively via the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (IQ range, 40-160, standardized to a mean of 100 [SD, 15]) and subjectively via informant and self-reports (z-score units; scale mean, 0 [SD, 1]).\nOf 1037 original participants, 997 were alive at age 45 years, of whom 564 (57%) had received lead testing at age 11 years (302 [54%] male) (median follow-up, 34 [interquartile range, 33.7-34.7] years). Mean blood lead level at age 11 years was 10.99 (SD, 4.63) \u03bcg/dL. After adjusting for covariates, each 5-\u03bcg/dL higher childhood blood lead level was significantly associated with 1.19-cm2 smaller cortical surface area (95% CI, -2.35 to -0.02 cm2; P\u2009=\u2009.05), 0.10-cm3 smaller hippocampal volume (95% CI, -0.17 to -0.03 cm3; P\u2009=\u2009.006), lower global fractional anisotropy (b\u2009=\u2009-0.12; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u2009.04), and a BrainAGE index 0.77 years older (95% CI, 0.02-1.51 years; P\u2009=\u2009.05) at age 45 years. There were no statistically significant associations between blood lead level and log-transformed white matter hyperintensity volume (b\u2009=\u20090.05 log mm3; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.13 log mm3; P\u2009=\u2009.17) or mean cortical thickness (b\u2009=\u2009-0.004 mm; 95% CI, -0.012 to 0.004 mm; P\u2009=\u2009.39). Each 5-\u03bcg/dL higher childhood blood lead level was significantly associated with a 2.07-point lower IQ score at age 45 years (95% CI, -3.39 to -0.74; P\u2009=\u2009.002) and a 0.12-point higher score on informant-rated cognitive problems (95% CI, 0.01-0.23; P\u2009=\u2009.03). There was no statistically significant association between childhood blood lead levels and self-reported cognitive problems (b\u2009=\u2009-0.02 points; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.07; P\u2009=\u2009.68).\nIn this longitudinal cohort study with a median 34-year follow-up, higher childhood blood lead level was associated with differences in some MRI measures of brain structure that suggested lower structural brain integrity in midlife. Because of the large number of statistical comparisons, some findings may represent type I error.", "The benefits of data and analytics for health care systems and single providers is an increasingly investigated field in digital health literature. Electronic health records (EHR), for example, can improve quality of care. Emerging analytics tools based on artificial intelligence show the potential to assist physicians in day-to-day workflows. Yet, single health care providers also need information regarding the economic impact when deciding on potential adoption of these tools.\nThis paper examines the question of whether data and analytics provide economic advantages or disadvantages for health care providers. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview including a variety of technologies beyond computer-based patient records. Ultimately, findings are also intended to determine whether economic barriers for adoption by providers could exist.\nA systematic literature search of the PubMed and Google Scholar online databases was conducted, following the hermeneutic methodology that encourages iterative search and interpretation cycles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria to 165 initially identified studies, 50 were included for qualitative synthesis and topic-based clustering.\nThe review identified 5 major technology categories, namely EHRs (n=30), computerized clinical decision support (n=8), advanced analytics (n=5), business analytics (n=5), and telemedicine (n=2). Overall, 62% (31/50) of the reviewed studies indicated a positive economic impact for providers either via direct cost or revenue effects or via indirect efficiency or productivity improvements. When differentiating between categories, however, an ambiguous picture emerged for EHR, whereas analytics technologies like computerized clinical decision support and advanced analytics predominantly showed economic benefits.\nThe research question of whether data and analytics create economic benefits for health care providers cannot be answered uniformly. The results indicate ambiguous effects for EHRs, here representing data, and mainly positive effects for the significantly less studied analytics field. The mixed results regarding EHRs can create an economic barrier for adoption by providers. This barrier can translate into a bottleneck to positive economic effects of analytics technologies relying on EHR data. Ultimately, more research on economic effects of technologies other than EHRs is needed to generate a more reliable evidence base.", "The increasing availability of digital images, coupled with sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for image classification, presents an exciting opportunity for biodiversity researchers to create new datasets of species observations. We investigated whether an AI plant species classifier could extract previously unexploited biodiversity data from social media photos (Flickr). We found over 60,000 geolocated images tagged with the keyword \"flower\" across an urban and rural location in the UK and classified these using AI, reviewing these identifications and assessing the representativeness of images. Images were predominantly biodiversity focused, showing single species. Non-native garden plants dominated, particularly in the urban setting. The AI classifier performed best when photos were focused on single native species in wild situations but also performed well at higher taxonomic levels (genus and family), even when images substantially deviated from this. We present a checklist of questions that should be considered when undertaking a similar analysis.", "Opportunistic prostate cancer (PCa) screening is a controversial topic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to detect prostate cancer with a high sensitivity and specificity, leading to the idea to perform an image-guided prostate cancer (PCa) screening; Methods: We evaluated a prospectively enrolled cohort of 49 healthy men participating in a dedicated image-guided PCa screening trial employing a biparametric MRI (bpMRI) protocol consisting of T2-weighted (T2w) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences. Datasets were analyzed both by human readers and by a fully automated artificial intelligence (AI) software using deep learning (DL). Agreement between the algorithm and the reports-serving as the ground truth-was compared on a per-case and per-lesion level using metrics of diagnostic accuracy and k statistics; Results: The DL method yielded an 87% sensitivity (33/38) and 50% specificity (5/10) with a k of 0.42. 12/28 (43%) Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3, 16/22 (73%) PI-RADS 4, and 5/5 (100%) PI-RADS 5 lesions were detected compared to the ground truth. Targeted biopsy revealed PCa in six participants, all correctly diagnosed by both the human readers and AI.\nThe results of our study show that in our AI-assisted, image-guided prostate cancer screening the software solution was able to identify highly suspicious lesions and has the potential to effectively guide the targeted-biopsy workflow.", "The emergence of whole slide imaging technology allows for pathology diagnosis on a computer screen. The applications of digital pathology are expanding, from supporting remote institutes suffering from a shortage of pathologists to routine use in daily diagnosis including that of lung cancer. Through practice and research large archival databases of digital pathology images have been developed that will facilitate the development of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for image analysis. Currently, several AI applications have been reported in the field of lung cancer; these include the segmentation of carcinoma foci, detection of lymph node metastasis, counting of tumor cells, and prediction of gene mutations. Although the integration of AI algorithms into clinical practice remains a significant challenge, we have implemented tumor cell count for genetic analysis, a helpful application for routine use. Our experience suggests that pathologists often overestimate the contents of tumor cells, and the use of AI-based analysis increases the accuracy and makes the tasks less tedious. However, there are several difficulties encountered in the practical use of AI in clinical diagnosis. These include the lack of sufficient annotated data for the development and validation of AI systems, the explainability of black box AI models, such as those based on deep learning that offer the most promising performance, and the difficulty in defining the ground truth data for training and validation owing to inherent ambiguity in most applications. All of these together present significant challenges in the development and clinical translation of AI methods in the practice of pathology. Additional research on these problems will help in resolving the barriers to the clinical use of AI. Helping pathologists in developing knowledge of the working and limitations of AI will benefit the use of AI in both diagnostics and research.", "In 2015, we provided an overview of the use of digital technologies in clinical trials, both as a methodological tool and as a mechanism to deliver interventions. At that time, there was limited guidance and limited use of digital technologies in clinical research. However, since then smartphones have become ubiquitous and digital health technologies have exploded. This paper provides an update to our earlier publication and an overview of how technology has been used in the past five years in clinical trials, providing examples with varying levels of technological integration and across different health conditions. Digital technology integration ranges from the incorporation of artificial intelligence in diagnostic devices to the use of real-world data (e.g., electronic health records) for study recruitment. Clinical trials can now be conducted entirely virtually, eliminating the need for in-person interaction. Much of the published research demonstrates how digital approaches can improve the design and implementation of clinical trials. While challenges remain, progress over the last five years is encouraging, and barriers can be overcome with careful planning.", "New data specific to COVID-19 are emerging quickly on key issues of immunity and prevention, but past research in coronavirology and for other human pathogens (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae) has been available and of great relevance. Considerable study of endemic human coronaviruses has shown that neutralizing antibody correlates with protection, but effective clinical protection is variable for subsequent virus exposure. Animal coronavirus research has emphasized the importance of local mucosal protection (especially IgA) and systemic responses. Animal model and human post-infection studies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are largely corroborative. Whether for passive therapeutic strategies or vaccination, these findings provide a template for COVID-19. Many approaches to vaccination have emerged, and there may be more than one vaccine that will be applied, but individualized obstacles and concerns for administration, efficacy, and safety are inevitable. Regardless of safeguards or promises that may be understood from laboratory or vertebrate experiments, observations from large-scale human trials will ultimately prove to shape the medical future. Focus on common mucosal immunity can be underrated, and equally or more, focus on lactogenic immunity may be underestimated. In understanding both passive immunity and protection, the body is already primed to educate us with decisions of what constitutes protection and harm. This review provides key insights that drive hypotheses into how the instinct of immunity and the intelligence of the maternal component of the common mucosal immune system has already guided us and may continue to do so effectively into a bright and safe future.", "There is a lack of evidence concerning the prospective effect of cumulative exposure to psychosocial job stressors over time on mental ill-health. This study aimed to assess whether cumulative exposure to poor quality jobs places employees at risk of future common mental disorder.\nData were from the Personality and Total Health Through Life project (n=1279, age 40-46 at baseline). Data reported on the cumulative exposure to multiple indicators of poor psychosocial job quality over time (ie, a combination of low control, high demands and high insecurity) and future common mental disorder (ie, depressive and/or anxiety symptom scores above a validated threshold) 12 years later. Data were analysed using logistic regression models and controlled for potential confounders across the lifespan.\nCumulative exposure to poor-quality work (particularly more secure work) on multiple occasions elevated the risk of subsequent common mental disorder, independent of social, health, verbal intelligence and personality trait confounders (OR=1.30, 95%\u2009CI 1.06 to 1.59).\nOur findings show that cumulative exposure to poor psychosocial job quality over time independently predicts future common mental disorder-supporting the need for workplace interventions to prevent repeated exposure of poor quality work.", "To evaluate a new-generation, non-invasive, wireless axillary thermometer with artificial intelligence, iThermonitor (WT705, Raiing Medical, Beijing, China), and to ascertain its feasibility for perioperative continuous body temperature monitoring in surgical patients.\nDepartments of Biliary Surgery and Operating Room and the post-anaesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital in Chengdu, China.\nA total of 526 adult surgical patients were consecutively enrolled.\nThis was a prospective observational study. Axillary temperatures were continuously recorded with iThermonitor throughout the whole perioperative period. The temperatures of the contralateral armpit were measured with mercury thermometers at 8:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00 every day and were used as references.\nThe outcomes were the accuracy and precision of the temperatures measured with iThermonitor, the validity to detect fever and the feasibility of continuous wear. Pairs of temperatures were evaluated with Student's t-test, Pearson's correlation and repeated-measures Bland-Altman plot.\nA total of 3621 pairs of body temperatures were obtained. The temperatures measured with iThermonitor agreed with those measured with the mercury thermometers overall, with a mean difference of 0.03\u00b0C\u00b10.35\u00b0C and a moderate correlation (r=0.755, p<0.001). The 95% limits of agreement (LoA) ranged from -0.63\u00b0C to 0.73\u00b0C, with 5.11% of the differences outside the 95% LoA. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.753. Continuous temperature monitoring captured more fevers than intermittent observation (117/526 vs 91/526, p<0.001), detected fever up to 4.35\u2009hours earlier, and captured a higher peak temperature (0.29\u00b0C\u00b10.27\u00b0C, 95% CI: 0.26-0.31). All subjects felt that wearing iThermonitor was more or less comfortable and did not affect their daily activities.\niThermonitor is promising for continuous remote temperature monitoring in surgical patients. However, further developments are still needed to improve the precision of this device, especially for temperature detection in underweight patients and those with lower body temperature.\nChiCTR1900024549; Results (registered on 5 July 2019).", "Congenital heart block (CHB) is associated with a mortality rate of 20% and requires a pacemaker in 70% of cases. Steroids can reduce morbidity and prevent the onset of CHB but may have adverse effects on growth and neurodevelopment. This study aimed to clarify the long-term effects of antenatal betamethasone administration on growth and neurodevelopment.\nThe subjects were children with a high risk of CHB due to a high level of maternal anti-SSA/Ro antibody or a maternal history of a previous delivery of a offspring with CHB to whom antenatal betamethasone was administered. Data on body weight, height, and blood pressure were collected as physical outcomes. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (fourth edition) or the Kyoto Scale of Psychological Development and the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Autism Society Japan Rating Scale was administered to assess the neurodevelopmental outcome.\nFourteen children were enrolled. The body weight and height were within normal range in all children. All children had normal intelligence, and none had autism.\nOur study suggested that antenatal betamethasone administration has no negative effects on long-term physical and neurodevelopmental outcomes.", "The study is designed to explore the chest CT features of different clinical types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia based on a Chinese multicenter dataset using an artificial intelligence (AI) system.\nA total of 164 patients confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively enrolled from 6 hospitals. All patients were divided into the mild type (136 cases) and the severe type (28 cases) according to their clinical manifestations. The total CT severity score and quantitative CT features were calculated by AI pneumonia detection and evaluation system with correction by radiologists. The clinical and CT imaging features of different types were analyzed.\nIt was observed that patients in the severe type group were older than the mild type group. Round lesions, Fan-shaped lesions, crazy-paving pattern, fibrosis, \"white lung\", pleural thickening, pleural indentation, mediastinal lymphadenectasis were more common in the CT images of severe patients than in the mild ones. A higher total lung severity score and scores of each lobe were observed in the severe group, with higher scores in bilateral lower lobes of both groups. Further analysis showed that the volume and number of pneumonia lesions and consolidation lesions in overall lung were higher in the severe group, and showed a wider distribution in the lower lobes of bilateral lung in both groups.\nChest CT of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia showed more consolidative and progressive lesions. With the assistance of AI, CT could evaluate the clinical severity of COVID-19 pneumonia more precisely and help the early diagnosis and surveillance of the patients.", "Filtered back projection was used in computed tomography (CT) but produced low-dose CT images that were noisy and included artifacts. Iterative reconstruction was introduced, which reduced noise and demonstrated dose reduction; however, reconstruction times were lengthy and noise texture appeared unnatural. Now, artificial intelligence (AI), is being applied to CT image reconstruction. These algorithms are fast and produce images comparable to those produced by iterative reconstruction. This article outlines image reconstruction techniques, including a generalized framework for deep learning. Ethics of AI in radiology also is discussed.", "DNA encodes RNA and is responsible for protein production in cells. RNA editing is the process by which genetic information is altered in the RNA molecule. RNA editing in cancer initiation, progression and development has been well documented and play an important role in tumorigenesis. Studying RNA editing and its application to change genetic information after transcription, RNA-editing technology could be an important innovation in cancer and has the potential for more effective precision treatment. Bioengineering integration approach and artificial intelligence could revolutionize the entire field of RNA editing for early detection of cancer.", "The management of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) in pregnancy is still uncertain. Over the years, several scientific societies published guidelines on the management of thyroid dysfunction before, during, and after pregnancy, the most recent ones being published by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) in 2017. This study aimed to review the published literature in the field from 2017 onward to investigate whether new findings can change ATA recommendations. A literature search was conducted in PubMed between March 2017 (date of the publication of the ATA guidelines) and March 2020. The research was restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), having pregnancy-related complications in patients with SCH and TAI as the main focus. A total of 5 RCTs were retrieved, 2 of which investigated pregnant women with SCH and 3 with TAI. Selected studies displayed proofs against treating maternal SCH and hypothyroxinemia because no benefit from LT4 was demonstrated in offspring intelligence quotient and in pregnancy outcomes; moreover, they reported proofs against treating TAI patients because no benefit from LT4 was demonstrated in improving pregnancy rate or live birth rate or reducing miscarriage rate.RCTs published from 2017 to 2020 might have a significant impact on current ATA guidelines. In particular, they suggested that isolated hypothyroxinemia and SCH should not be treated and that considering treatment in antibodypositive women, especially those with TSH of 2.5-4.0 mIU/L, would not be justified; they suggested that infertility and miscarriage rates are not decreased by LT4 treatment in euthyroid antibody-positive women seeking pregnancy.", "This article introduces a new model to identify a group of trajectory outliers from a large trajectory database and proposes several algorithms. These can be split into three categories: 1) algorithms based on data mining and knowledge discovery, which study the different correlations among the trajectory data and identify the group of abnormal trajectories from the knowledge extracted; 2) algorithms based on machine learning and computational intelligence methods, which use the ensemble learning and metaheuristics to find the group of trajectory outliers; and 3) an algorithm exploring the convolution deep neural network that learns the different features of historical data to determine the group of trajectory outliers. Experiments on different trajectory databases have been carried out to investigate the proposed algorithms. The results show that the deep learning solution outperforms data mining, machine learning, and computational intelligence solutions, as well as state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime and accuracy performance.", "To develop a deep learning model to automatically segment hepatocystic anatomy and assess the criteria defining the critical view of safety (CVS) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC).\nPoor implementation and subjective interpretation of CVS contributes to the stable rates of bile duct injuries in LC. As CVS is assessed visually, this task can be automated by using computer vision, an area of artificial intelligence aimed at interpreting images.\nStill images from LC videos were annotated with CVS criteria and hepatocystic anatomy segmentation. A deep neural network comprising a segmentation model to highlight hepatocystic anatomy and a classification model to predict CVS criteria achievement was trained and tested using 5-fold cross validation. Intersection over union, average precision, and balanced accuracy were computed to evaluate the model performance versus the annotated ground truth.\nA total of 2854 images from 201 LC videos were annotated and 402 images were further segmented. Mean intersection over union for segmentation was 66.6%. The model assessed the achievement of CVS criteria with a mean average precision and balanced accuracy of 71.9% and 71.4%, respectively.\nDeep learning algorithms can be trained to reliably segment hepatocystic anatomy and assess CVS criteria in still laparoscopic images. Surgical-technical partnerships should be encouraged to develop and evaluate deep learning models to improve surgical safety.", "With widespread applications of artificial intelligence (AI), the capabilities of the perception, understanding, decision-making, and control for autonomous systems have improved significantly in recent years. When autonomous systems consider the performance of accuracy and transferability, several AI methods, such as adversarial learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and meta-learning, show their powerful performance. Here, we review the learning-based approaches in autonomous systems from the perspectives of accuracy and transferability. Accuracy means that a well-trained model shows good results during the testing phase, in which the testing set shares a same task or a data distribution with the training set. Transferability means that when a well-trained model is transferred to other testing domains, the accuracy is still good. Firstly, we introduce some basic concepts of transfer learning and then present some preliminaries of adversarial learning, RL, and meta-learning. Secondly, we focus on reviewing the accuracy or transferability or both of these approaches to show the advantages of adversarial learning, such as generative adversarial networks, in typical computer vision tasks in autonomous systems, including image style transfer, image super-resolution, image deblurring/dehazing/rain removal, semantic segmentation, depth estimation, pedestrian detection, and person re-identification. We furthermore review the performance of RL and meta-learning from the aspects of accuracy or transferability or both of them in autonomous systems, involving pedestrian tracking, robot navigation, and robotic manipulation. Finally, we discuss several challenges and future topics for the use of adversarial learning, RL, and meta-learning in autonomous systems.", "Assessing the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to inform future preparedness response plans. Here we quantify the impact of 6,068\u2009hierarchically coded NPIs implemented in 79\u2009territories on the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19. We propose a modelling approach that combines four computational techniques merging statistical, inference and artificial intelligence tools. We validate our findings with two external datasets recording 42,151\u2009additional NPIs from 226\u2009countries. Our results indicate that a suitable combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. Less disruptive and costly NPIs can be as effective as more intrusive, drastic, ones (for example, a national lockdown). Using country-specific 'what-if' scenarios, we assess how the effectiveness of NPIs depends on the local context such as timing of their adoption, opening the way for forecasting the effectiveness of future interventions.", "Neuroscience research is undergoing a minor revolution. Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence research have opened up new ways of thinking about neural computation. Many researchers are excited by the possibility that deep neural networks may offer theories of perception, cognition and action for biological brains. This approach has the potential to radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems, because the computations performed by deep networks are learned from experience, and not endowed by the researcher. If so, how can neuroscientists use deep networks to model and understand biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists who seek to characterize computations or neural codes, or who wish to understand perception, attention, memory and executive functions? In this Perspective, our goal is to offer a road map for systems neuroscience research in the age of deep learning. We discuss the conceptual and methodological challenges of comparing behaviour, learning dynamics and neural representations in artificial and biological systems, and we highlight new research questions that have emerged for neuroscience as a direct consequence of recent advances in machine learning.", "Laboratory tests are considered an essential part of patient safety as patients' screening, diagnosis, and follow-up are solely based on laboratory tests. Diagnosis of patients could be wrong, missed, or delayed if laboratory tests are performed erroneously. However, recognizing the value of correct laboratory test ordering remains underestimated by policymakers and clinicians. Nowadays, artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning and deep learning (DL) have been extensively used as powerful tools for pattern recognition in large data sets. Therefore, developing an automated laboratory test recommendation tool using available data from electronic health records (EHRs) could support current clinical practice.\nThe objective of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence-based automated model that can provide laboratory tests recommendation based on simple variables available in EHRs.\nA retrospective analysis of the National Health Insurance database between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2013, was performed. We reviewed the record of all patients who visited the cardiology department at least once and were prescribed laboratory tests. The data set was split into training and testing sets (80:20) to develop the DL model. In the internal validation, 25% of data were randomly selected from the training set to evaluate the performance of this model.\nWe used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, recall, and hamming loss as comparative measures. A total of 129,938 prescriptions were used in our model. The DL-based automated recommendation system for laboratory tests achieved a significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCmacro and AUROCmicro of 0.76 and 0.87, respectively). Using a low cutoff, the model identified appropriate laboratory tests with 99% sensitivity.\nThe developed artificial intelligence model based on DL exhibited good discriminative capability for predicting laboratory tests using routinely collected EHR data. Utilization of DL approaches can facilitate optimal laboratory test selection for patients, which may in turn improve patient safety. However, future study is recommended to assess the cost-effectiveness for implementing this model in real-world clinical settings.", "Identifying pain generators in multilevel lumbar degenerative disc disease is not trivial but is crucial for lasting symptom relief with the targeted endoscopic spinal decompression surgery. Artificial intelligence (AI) applications of deep learning neural networks to the analysis of routine lumbar MRI scans could help the primary care and endoscopic specialist physician to compare the radiologist's report with a review of endoscopic clinical outcomes.\nTo analyze and compare the probability of predicting successful outcome with lumbar spinal endoscopy by using the radiologist's MRI grading and interpretation of the radiologic image with a novel AI deep learning neural network (Multus Radbot\u2122) as independent prognosticators.\nThe location and severity of foraminal stenosis were analyzed using comparative ordinal grading by the radiologist, and a contiguous grading by the AI network in patients suffering from lateral recess and foraminal stenosis due to lumbar herniated disc. The compressive pathology definitions were extracted from the radiologist lumbar MRI reports from 65 patients with a total of 383 levels for the central canal - (0) no disc bulge/protrusion/canal stenosis, (1) disc bulge without canal stenosis, (2) disc bulge resulting in canal stenosis, and (3) disc herniation/protrusion/extrusion resulting in canal stenosis. Both neural foramina were assessed with either - (0) neural foraminal stenosis absent, or (1) neural foramina are stenosis present. Reporting criteria for the pathologies at each disc level and, when available, the grading of severity were extracted and assigned into two categories: \"Normal,\" and \"Stenosis.\" Clinical outcomes were graded using dichotomized modified Macnab criteria considering Excellent and Good results as \"Improved,\" and Fair and Poor outcomes as \"Not Improved.\" Binary logistic regression analysis was used to predict the probability of the AI- and radiologist grading of stenosis at the 88 foraminal decompression sites to result in \"Improved\" outcomes.\nThe average age of the 65 patients was 62.7 +/- 12.7 years. They consisted of 51 (54.3%) males and 43 (45.7%) females. At an average final follow-up of 57.4 +/- 12.57, Macnab outcome analysis showed that 86.4% of the 88 foraminal decompressions resulted in Excellent and Good (Improved) clinical outcomes. The stenosis grading by the radiologist showed an average severity score of 4.71 +/- 2.626, and the average AI severity grading was 5.65 +/- 3.73. Logit regression probability analysis of the two independent prognosticators showed that both the grading by the radiologist (86.2%; odds ratio 1.264) and the AI grading (86.4%; odds ratio 1.267) were nearly equally predictive of a successful outcome with the endoscopic decompression.\nDeep learning algorithms are capable of identifying lumbar foraminal compression due to herniated disc. The treatment outcome was correlated to the decompression of the directly visualized corresponding pathology during the lumbar endoscopy. This research should be extended to other validated pain generators in the lumbar spine.\n3.\nValidity, clinical teaching, evaluation study.", "In this piece, Daniel Leufer introduces his project, aimyths.org, a website that tackles eight of the most harmful myths and misconceptions about artificial intelligence. By showing the damage caused by everything from misleading headlines about AI progress to attempts to use machine learning to predict complex social outcomes, Leufer's project underlines the importance of getting beyond the hype around AI.", "Autistic children often experience higher levels of anxiety than their peers. It can be difficult to diagnose and treat anxiety disorders in autistic children, in part because of the high degree of variability in their underlying abilities and presentations. Some evidence suggests that autistic children with higher intelligence (as measured by intelligence quotient) experience higher levels of anxiety than autistic children with lower intelligence. However, the evidence is inconsistent, with other papers not finding a difference or finding higher levels of anxiety in autistic children with lower intelligence. In this article, we review existing literature to see whether autistic children with higher intelligence quotients have higher anxiety than autistic children with lower intelligence quotients. A systematic search of the literature was conducted which identified 49 papers on the topic. The methods of all the papers were reviewed using an objective quality assessment framework. When combining the data statistically, there was evidence that autistic children with higher intelligence quotients are more anxious than autistic children with lower intelligence quotients. The quality review raised common weaknesses across studies. Most importantly, few studies used measures of anxiety that have been shown to be valid for children with very low intelligence quotients. Similarly, many studies used measures of anxiety that have not been shown to be valid for autistic children. These factors are important because autistic children and those with low intelligence quotient may experience or understand anxiety differently. Future research should use fully validated measures to test whether high intelligence quotient is associated with high levels of anxiety in autistic children.", "Electromagnetic (EM) sensing is a widespread contactless examination technique with applications in areas such as health care and the internet of things. Most conventional sensing systems lack intelligence, which not only results in expensive hardware and complicated computational algorithms but also poses important challenges for real-time in situ sensing. To address this shortcoming, we propose the concept of intelligent sensing by designing a programmable metasurface for data-driven learnable data acquisition and integrating it into a data-driven learnable data-processing pipeline. Thereby, a measurement strategy can be learned jointly with a matching data post-processing scheme, optimally tailored to the specific sensing hardware, task, and scene, allowing us to perform high-quality imaging and high-accuracy recognition with a remarkably reduced number of measurements. We report the first experimental demonstration of \"learned sensing\" applied to microwave imaging and gesture recognition. Our results pave the way for learned EM sensing with low latency and computational burden.", "Due to recent advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), the demand for high quality immersive contents is a primary concern for production companies and consumers. Similarly, the topical record-breaking performance of deep learning in various domains of artificial intelligence has extended the attention of researchers to contribute to different fields of computer vision. To ensure the quality of immersive media contents using these advanced deep learning technologies, several learning based Stitched Image Quality Assessment methods have been proposed with reasonable performances. However, these methods are unable to localize, segment, and extract the stitching errors in panoramic images. Further, these methods used computationally complex procedures for quality assessment of panoramic images. With these motivations, in this paper, we propose a novel three-fold Deep Learning based No-Reference Stitched Image Quality Assessment (DLNR-SIQA) approach to evaluate the quality of immersive contents. In the first fold, we fined-tuned the state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN (Regional Convolutional Neural Network) on manually annotated various stitching error-based cropped images from the two publicly available datasets. In the second fold, we segment and localize various stitching errors present in the immersive contents. Finally, based on the distorted regions present in the immersive contents, we measured the overall quality of the stitched images. Unlike existing methods that only measure the quality of the images using deep features, our proposed method can efficiently segment and localize stitching errors and estimate the image quality by investigating segmented regions. We also carried out extensive qualitative and quantitative comparison with full reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) and no reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) on two publicly available datasets, where the proposed system outperformed the existing state-of-the-art techniques.", "Artificial intelligence techniques have been positioned in the resolution of problems in various areas of healthcare. Clinical decision support systems developed from this technology have optimized the healthcare of patients with chronic diseases through mobile applications. In this study, several models based on this methodology have been developed to calculate the basal insulin dose in patients with type I diabetes using subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps. Methods. A pilot experimental study was performed with data from 56 patients with type 1 diabetes who used insulin infusion pumps and underwent continuous glucose monitoring. Several models based on artificial intelligence techniques were developed to analyze glycemic patterns based on continuous glucose monitoring and clinical variables in order to estimate the basal insulin dose. We used neural networks (NNs), Bayesian networks (BNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and random forests (RF). We then evaluated the agreement between predicted and actual values using several statistical error measurements: mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (R), and determination coefficient (R 2). Results. Twenty-four different models were obtained, one for each hour of the day, with each chosen technique. Correlation coefficients obtained with RF, SVMs, NNs, and BNs were 0.9999, 0.9921, 0.0303, and 0.7754, respectively. The error increased between 06:00 and 07:00 and between 13:00 and 17:00. Conclusions. The performance of the RF technique was excellent and got very close to the actual values. Intelligence techniques could be used to predict basal insulin dose. However, it is necessary to explore the validity of the results and select the target population. Models that allow for more accurate levels of prediction should be further explored.", "Residential greenness has been reported to be positively associated with health benefits for children, including improved cognitive function. We investigated the association between the intelligence quotient (IQ) of 6-year-old children in Seoul, South Korea and surrounding greenness currently and during the mothers' pregnancy. We also analyzed whether these effects differed by the type of greenness, such as natural or built greenness.\nThis study considered 189 mother-child dyads from the Environment and Development of Children Cohort study, who lived in Seoul during the prenatal period and when the child was 6\u00a0years old. We defined surrounding greenness using Landsat image data from Korean Arirang satellite images with buffers within 100\u00a0m - 2000\u00a0m of the radius of each participant's residential address. We separately analyzed two types of greenness, namely natural and built greenness. The children's IQ (total, verbal, and performance IQ) was measured using the Korean Educational Developmental Institute's Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.\nPrenatal exposure to built greenness in 500\u00a0m and 1000\u00a0m buffers was associated with children's total IQ in a full model [difference in IQ (95% CI): 3.46(0.68, 6.24) and 3.42 (0.53, 6.31) per interquartile increase in proportion of greenness]. However, postnatal exposure to built greenness in all buffers was associated in children's total IQ. We found a stronger association between children's total IQ and built greenness rather than natural greenness.\nWe found that 6-year-old children tended to score higher on total IQ if they lived in greener neighborhoods. The results provide further evidence of the health benefits of greenness and provide support for urban planning and public health to build healthy urban cities for children and pregnant women.", "Among many possible variables that can be associated with gratitude, researchers list personality traits. Considering that these relationships are not always consistent, the first purpose of the present study was to verify how the Big Five factors connect to dispositional gratitude in a sample of Polish participants. The second purpose was to assess the unique contribution of personality traits on gratitude with multiple regression analyses. Moreover, because much remains to be learned about whether these associations are indirectly influenced by different personal or social variables, the third goal was to explore the role of emotional intelligence as a potential mediational mechanism implicated in the relationship between personality traits and gratitude.\nThe sample consisted of 712 Polish respondents who were aged between 17 and 88. Most of them were women (64.3%). They answered questionnaires concerning their personality traits, emotional intelligence, and gratitude. The research was conducted using the paper-and-pencil method through convenience sampling.\nThe results showed that both gratitude and emotional intelligence correlated positively and significantly with extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Gratitude and emotional intelligence correlated negatively and significantly with neuroticism. The personality predictor of gratitude with the highest and positive standardized regression value was agreeableness, followed by openness to experience and extraversion. Neuroticism had a negative impact on gratitude. Conscientiousness was the only statistically insignificant predictor in the tested multiple regression model. Moreover, emotional intelligence mediated the relationship between four dimensions of personality (extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) and gratitude and acted as a suppressor between neuroticism and gratitude.\nThe current study broadens our comprehension of the interaction among personality traits, emotional intelligence, and a grateful disposition. Moreover, it imparts a noteworthy foundation not only for the mediatory role of emotional intelligence between four dimensions of personality and gratitude but also for its suppressor effect between neuroticism and being grateful.", "Skin cancer is among the 10 most common cancers. Recent research revealed the superiority of artificial intelligence (AI) over dermatologists to diagnose skin cancer from predesignated and cropped images. However, there remain several uncertainties for AI in diagnosing skin cancers, including lack of testing for consistency, lack of pathological proof or ambiguous comparisons. Hence, to develop a reliable, feasible and user-friendly platform to facilitate the automatic diagnostic algorithm is important. The aim of this study was to build a light-weight skin cancer classification model based on deep learning methods for aiding first-line medical care. The developed model can be deployed on cloud platforms as well as mobile devices for remote diagnostic applications. We reviewed the medical records and clinical images of patients who received a histological diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, seborrheic keratosis and melanocytic nevus in 2006-2017 in the Department of Dermatology in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (KCGMH). We used the deep learning models to identify skin cancers and benign skin tumors in the manner of binary classification and multi-class classification in the KCGMH and HAM10000 datasets to construct a skin cancer classification model. The accuracy reached 89.5% for the binary classifications (benign vs malignant) in the KCGMH dataset; the accuracy was 85.8% in the HAM10000 dataset in seven-class classification and 72.1% in the KCGMH dataset in five-class classification. Our results demonstrate that our skin cancer classification model based on deep learning methods is a highly promising aid for the clinical diagnosis and early identification of skin cancers and benign tumors.", "This opinion piece provides insight on the creation of artistic visuals using artificial intelligence. It describes how 3 artists evolving in this field decided to use technology in a derived way, with the help of researchers and enthusiasts working open source, to talk about how our society is developing with regards to technology adoption.", "The implementation and utilization of electronic health records is generating a large volume and variety of data, which are difficult to process using traditional techniques. However, these data could help answer important questions in cancer surveillance and epidemiology research. Artificial intelligence (AI) data processing methods are capable of evaluating large volumes of data, yet current literature on their use in this context of pharmacy informatics is not well characterized.\nA systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate relevant publications within four domains (cancer, pharmacy, AI methods, population science) across PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library and included all publications indexed between July 17, 2008, and December 31, 2018. The search returned 3,271 publications, which were evaluated for inclusion.\nThere were 36 studies that met criteria for full-text abstraction. Of those, only 45% specifically identified the pharmacy data source, and 55% specified drug agents or drug classes. Multiple AI methods were used; 25% used machine learning (ML), 67% used natural language processing (NLP), and 8% combined ML and NLP.\nThis review demonstrates that the application of AI data methods for pharmacy informatics and cancer epidemiology research is expanding. However, the data sources and representations are often missing, challenging study replicability. In addition, there is no consistent format for reporting results, and one of the preferred metrics, F-score, is often missing. There is a resultant need for greater transparency of original data sources and performance of AI methods with pharmacy data to improve the translation of these results into meaningful outcomes.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and Machine Learning (ML)-based applications in particular, have the potential to change the scope of healthcare, including orthopaedic surgery.The greatest benefit of ML is in its ability to learn from real-world clinical use and experience, and thereby its capability to improve its own performance.Many successful applications are known in orthopaedics, but have yet to be adopted and evaluated for accuracy and efficacy in patients' care and doctors' workflows.The recent hype around AI triggered hope for development of better risk stratification tools to personalize orthopaedics in all subsequent steps of care, from diagnosis to treatment.Computer vision applications for fracture recognition show promising results to support decision-making, overcome bias, process high-volume workloads without fatigue, and hold the promise of even outperforming doctors in certain tasks.In the near future, AI-derived applications are very likely to assist orthopaedic surgeons rather than replace us.

This is particularly true in domains where the decisions are high-stakes, such as law, medicine, and the military. In this Perspective, we describe the particular challenges for AI decision support posed in military coalition operations. These include having to deal with limited, low-quality data, which inevitably compromises AI performance. We suggest that these problems can be mitigated by taking steps that allow rapid trust calibration so that decision makers understand the AI system's limitations and likely failures and can calibrate their trust in its outputs appropriately. We propose that AI services can achieve this by being both interpretable and uncertainty-aware. Creating such AI systems poses various technical and human factors challenges. We review these challenges and recommend directions for future research.", "The potential for machine learning to disrupt the medical profession is the subject of ongoing debate within biomedical informatics.\nThis study aimed to explore psychiatrists' opinions about the potential impact innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice.\nIn Spring 2019, we conducted a web-based survey of 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries worldwide. The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (\"comments\") to three open-ended questions in the survey.\nComments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that 'man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention.\nThis study presents timely information on psychiatrists' views about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice. Psychiatrists expressed divergent views about the value and impact of future technology with worrying omissions about practice guidelines, and ethical and regulatory issues.", "Emergency management of the emerging infectious disease outbreak is critical for public health threats. Currently, control of the COVID-19 outbreak is an international concern and has become a crucial challenge in many countries. This article reviews significant information technologyIT) applications in emergency management of COVID-19 by considering the prevention/mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery phases of the crisis. This review was conducted using MEDLINE PubMed), Embase, IEEE, and Google Scholar. Expert opinions were collected to show existence gaps, useful technologies for each phase of emergency management, and future direction. Results indicated that various IT-based systems such as surveillance systems, artificial intelligence, computational methods, Internet of things, remote sensing sensor, online service, and GIS geographic information system) could have different outbreak management applications, especially in response phases. Information technology was applied in several aspects, such as increasing the accuracy of diagnosis, early detection, ensuring healthcare providers' safety, decreasing workload, saving time and cost, and drug discovery. We categorized these applications into four core topics, including diagnosis and prediction, treatment, protection, and management goals, which were confirmed by five experts. Without applying IT, the control and management of the crisis could be difficult on a large scale. For reducing and improving the hazard effect of disaster situations, the role of IT is inevitable. In addition to the response phase, communities should be considered to use IT capabilities in prevention, preparedness, and recovery phases. It is expected that IT will have an influential role in the recovery phase of COVID-19. Providing IT infrastructure and financial support by the governments should be more considered in facilitating IT capabilities.", "In recent years there has been an explosion of interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) both in health care and academic philosophy. This has been due mainly to the rise of effective machine learning and deep learning algorithms, together with increases in data collection and processing power, which have made rapid progress in many areas. However, use of this technology has brought with it philosophical issues and practical problems, in particular, epistemic and ethical. In this paper the authors, with backgrounds in philosophy, maternity care practice and clinical research, draw upon and extend a recent framework for shared decision-making (SDM) that identified a duty of care to the client's knowledge as a necessary condition for SDM. This duty entails the responsibility to acknowledge and overcome epistemic defeaters. This framework is applied to the use of AI in maternity care, in particular, the use of machine learning and deep learning technology to attempt to enhance electronic fetal monitoring (EFM). In doing so, various sub-kinds of epistemic defeater, namely, transparent, opaque, underdetermined, and inherited defeaters are taxonomized and discussed. The authors argue that, although effective current or future AI-enhanced EFM may impose an epistemic obligation on the part of clinicians to rely on such systems' predictions or diagnoses as input to SDM, such obligations may be overridden by inherited defeaters, caused by a form of algorithmic bias. The existence of inherited defeaters implies that the duty of care to the client's knowledge extends to any situation in which a clinician (or anyone else) is involved in producing training data for a system that will be used in SDM. Any future AI must be capable of assessing women individually, taking into account a wide range of factors including women's preferences, to provide a holistic range of evidence for clinical decision-making.", "The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models that can identify safe and dangerous zones of dissection, and anatomical landmarks during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC).\nMany adverse events during surgery occur due to errors in visual perception and judgment leading to misinterpretation of anatomy. Deep learning, a subfield of AI, can potentially be used to provide real-time guidance intraoperatively.\nDeep learning models were developed and trained to identify safe (Go) and dangerous (No-Go) zones of dissection, liver, gallbladder, and hepatocystic triangle during LC. Annotations were performed by 4 high-volume surgeons. AI predictions were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation against annotations by expert surgeons. Primary outcomes were intersection- over-union (IOU) and F1 score (validated spatial correlation indices), and secondary outcomes were pixel-wise accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, \u00b1 standard deviation.\nAI models were trained on 2627 random frames from 290 LC videos, procured from 37 countries, 136 institutions, and 153 surgeons. Mean IOU, F1 score, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the AI to identify Go zones were 0.53 (\u00b10.24), 0.70 (\u00b10.28), 0.94 (\u00b10.05), 0.69 (\u00b10.20). and 0.94 (\u00b10.03), respectively. For No-Go zones, these metrics were 0.71 (\u00b10.29), 0.83 (\u00b10.31), 0.95 (\u00b10.06), 0.80 (\u00b10.21), and 0.98 (\u00b10.05), respectively. Mean IOU for identification of the liver, gallbladder, and hepatocystic triangle were: 0.86 (\u00b10.12), 0.72 (\u00b10.19), and 0.65 (\u00b10.22), respectively.\nAI can be used to identify anatomy within the surgical field. This technology may eventually be used to provide real-time guidance and minimize the risk of adverse events.", "Gas well liquification is a problematic process whereby liquids collect in the wellbore and near wellbore reservoir resulting in production impedance in aging gas wells. Removal of these liquids is traditionally performed through human operated blowdown events; however, this practice results in the release of hydrocarbon emissions into the atmosphere. The removal process, called 'deliquification', can also be accomplished through the utilization of various plunger lift technologies. These allow the extraction of retained fluids from the wellbore and near-wellbore reservoir; however, these technologies vary greatly with respect to automation, intelligence, and efficacy. Here we examined the rates of production loss and the frequency of emission events in mature natural gas wells equipped with various automated plunger lift technologies. Overall, 'intelligent' plunger lift systems that base their optimization on reservoir and wellbore conditions, as opposed to standardized or scheduled operations, performed the best exhibiting a 0.13% loss of production gas to atmospheric emissions compared to a 1.37% loss of production observed from wells without a plunger lift system. Additionally, wells equipped with a next generation reservoir optimized plunger lift demonstrated a reduced rate of production decline compared to those wells without a plunger lift technology (-0.066%/day and -0.242%/day, respectively). These data have widespread implications for the operational and environmental management of a consistently increasing count of aging natural gas production wells.", "The aim of the research was to verify the possibilities of using virtual reality in combination with classical approaches to the rehabilitation of\u00a0patients after stroke.\nAs part of rehabilitation, we examined the possibilities of rehabilitation of the upper, lower limbs and fine mobility of the upper limbs in a selected group of patients that met the criteria for inclusion in a combined rehabilitation program using virtual reality with a focus on testing different approaches, devices and applications. At the same time, we tried to identify quantitative and qualitative parameters that could be objectively measured and based on them to evaluate the progress of patients in rehabilitation or in personalizing individual rehabilitation scenarios.\nIn patients who underwent a combined method of rehabilitation, we observed progress in the development of their ability to improve motor skills. We identified various categories of parameters that can be evaluated by artificial intelligence methods, and we also identified that the key elements in the use of\u00a0virtual reality as a rehabilitation method are the so-called \"WOW\" effect and the creation of an emotional change in the patient that motivates him to rehabilitate.\nWe have shown that virtual reality methods have the potential to accelerate rehabilitation and increase the motivation of selected groups of patients after stroke.", "National point prevalence surveys (PPS) of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) and antimicrobial prescribing in hospitals were conducted in 2011 and 2016 in Scotland. When comparing results of PPS, it is important to adjust for any differences in patient case-mix that may confound the comparison.\nTo describe the methodology used to compare prevalence for the two surveys and illustrate the importance of taking case-mix (patient and hospital stay characteristics) into account.\nMultivariate models (clustered logistic regression) that adjusted for differences in patient case-mix were used to describe the difference in prevalence of six outcomes (HAI, antimicrobial prescribing and four devices: central vascular catheter, peripheral vascular catheter, urinary catheterisation and intubation) between the 2011 and 2016 PPS. Univariate models that did not adjust for these differences were also developed for comparison to show the importance of adjusting for confounders.\nWithout adjustment for case-mix, HAI and intubation prevalence estimates were not significantly different in 2016 compared with 2011 although with adjustment, the prevalence of both was significantly lower (P=0.03 and P=0.02, respectively). These associations were only identified after adjustment for confounding by case-mix.\nWhile prevalence surveys do not provide intelligence on temporal trends as an incidence-based surveillance system would, if limitations and caveats are acknowledged, it is possible to compare two prevalence surveys to describe changing epidemiology. Adjusting for differences in case-mix is essential for robust comparisons. This methodology may be useful for other countries that are conducting large, repeated prevalence surveys.", "We discuss the new challenges and directions facing the use of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) in education research, policy-making, and industry. In recent years, applications of big data and AI in education have made significant headways. This highlights a novel trend in leading-edge educational research. The convenience and embeddedness of data collection within educational technologies, paired with computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality. We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms. However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly, in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialog between supporters of \"cold\" technology and \"warm\" humanity so that it can lead to greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology, and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for pedagogical practices and learning.", "Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disabilities and mortality worldwide, with higher prevalence in offender populations than in the general population. Previous research has strongly advocated increased awareness of TBI in offender populations. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence and characteristics of TBI, and to investigate associations and interactions between TBI, aggressive antisocial behaviors, general intellectual functioning, and substance use disorders (SUD) in a well-characterized group of young violent offenders. Methods: The study investigated a cohort (n = 269) of 18 to 25-year-old male violent offenders in Sweden. Data on TBI (files + self-report), aggressive antisocial behaviors (Life History of Aggression), SUD (clinical interviews), and general intellectual functioning (General Ability Index, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales Third Edition) were collected between 2010 and 2012. Parametric (Student's t-test) and non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman's rho, \u03c72, Kruskal Wallis test) inferential statistics were applied and effect sizes reported. Results: TBI, both with and without loss of consciousness, was common, with 77.5% of the offenders reporting having suffered at least one TBI during their lifetime. TBI was associated with an increased occurrence of aggressive antisocial behaviors and SUD, and offenders with both TBI and SUD evidenced the largest amount of aggressive antisocial behaviors. No clinically meaningful associations were found between TBI and general intelligence. Effect sizes were in the small to medium range. Conclusions: Our study confirms an increased prevalence of TBI among young violent offenders compared to the general population, as well as associations between TBI, aggressive antisocial behaviors, and SUD. However, it provides no information on the severity of the TBI, nor on the causality of the demonstrated associations. Nevertheless, TBI, and possible related deficits, need to be considered in the assessment and treatment of young violent offenders.", "Despite growing evidence that high creativity leads to mental well-being in older individuals, the neurophysiological bases of creativity remain elusive. Creativity reportedly involves multiple brain areas and their functional interconnections. In particular, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to investigate the role of patterns of functional connectivity between the default network and other networks in creative activity. These interactions among networks play the role of integrating various neural processes to support creative activity and involve attention, cognitive control, and memory. The electroencephalogram (EEG) enables researchers to capture a pattern of band-specific functional connectivity, as well as moment-to-moment dynamics of brain activity; this can be accomplished even in the resting-state by exploiting the excellent temporal resolution of the EEG. Furthermore, the recent advent of functional connectivity analysis in EEG studies has focused on the phase-difference variable because of its fine spatio-temporal resolution. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combining method of EEG signals having high-temporal resolution and the phase synchronization analysis having high-spatio-temporal resolutions brings a new insight of functional connectivity regarding high creative activity of older participants. In this study, we examined the resting-state EEG signal in 20 healthy older participants and estimated functional connectivities using the phase lag index (PLI), which evaluates the phase synchronization of EEG signals. Individual creativity was assessed using the S-A creativity test in a separate session before the EEG recording. In the analysis of associations of EEG measures with the S-A test scores, the covariate effect of the intelligence quotient was evaluated. As a result, higher individual S-A scores were significantly associated with higher node degrees, defined as the average PLI of a node (electrode) across all links with the remaining nodes, across all nodes at the alpha band. A conventional power spectrum analysis revealed no significant association with S-A scores in any frequency band. Older participants with high creativity exhibited high functional connectivity even in the resting-state, irrespective of intelligence quotient, which supports the theory that creativity entails widespread brain connectivity. Thus, PLIs derived from EEG data may provide new insights into the relationship between functional connectivity and creativity in healthy older people.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) can assist dentists in image assessment, for example, caries detection. The wider health and cost impact of employing AI for dental diagnostics has not yet been evaluated. We compared the cost-effectiveness of proximal caries detection on bitewing radiographs with versus without AI. U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network, had been trained, validated, and tested on 3,293, 252, and 141 bitewing radiographs, respectively, on which 4 experienced dentists had marked carious lesions (reference test). Lesions were stratified for initial lesions (E1/E2/D1, presumed noncavitated, receiving caries infiltration if detected) and advanced lesions (D2/D3, presumed cavitated, receiving restorative care if detected). A Markov model was used to simulate the consequences of true- and false-positive and true- and false-negative detections, as well as the subsequent decisions over the lifetime of patients. A German mixed-payers perspective was adopted. Our health outcome was tooth retention years. Costs were measured in 2020 euro. Monte-Carlo microsimulations and univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the cost-effectiveness acceptability at different willingness-to-pay thresholds were quantified. AI showed an accuracy of 0.80; dentists' mean accuracy was significantly lower at 0.71 (minimum-maximum: 0.61-0.78, P\u2009<\u20090.05). AI was significantly more sensitive than dentists (0.75 vs. 0.36 [0.19-0.65]; P\u2009=\u20090.006), while its specificity was not significantly lower (0.83 vs. 0.91 [0.69-0.98]; P\u2009>\u20090.05). In the base-case scenario, AI was more effective (tooth retention for a mean 64 [2.5%-97.5%: 61-65] y) and less costly (298 [244-367] euro) than assessment without AI (62 [59-64] y; 322 [257-394] euro). The ICER was -13.9 euro/y (i.e., AI saved money at higher effectiveness). In the majority (>77%) of all cases, AI was less costly and more effective. Applying AI for caries detection is likely to be cost-effective, mainly as fewer lesions remain undetected. Notably, this cost-effectiveness requires dentists to manage detected early lesions nonrestoratively.", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a means to non-invasively investigate the neurological links with dyslexia, a learning disability that affects one's ability to read. Most previous brain MRI studies of dyslexia and reading skill have used structural or diffusion imaging to reveal regional brain abnormalities. However, volumetric and diffusion MRI lack specificity in their interpretation at the microstructural level. Myelin is a critical neural component for brain function and plasticity, and as such, deficits in myelin may impact reading ability. MRI can estimate myelin using myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging, which is based on evaluation of the proportion of short T2 myelin-associated water from multi-exponential T2 relaxation analysis, but has not yet been applied to the study of reading or dyslexia. In this study, MWF MRI, intelligence, and reading assessments were acquired in 20 participants aged 10-18 years with a wide range of reading ability to investigate the relationship between reading ability and myelination. Group comparisons showed markedly lower MWF by 16-69% in poor readers relative to good readers in the left and right thalamus, as well as the left posterior limb of the internal capsule, left/right anterior limb of the internal capsule, left/right centrum semiovale, and splenium of the corpus callosum. MWF over the entire group also correlated positively with three different reading scores in the bilateral thalamus as well as white matter, including the splenium of the corpus callosum, left posterior limb of the internal capsule, left anterior limb of the internal capsule, and left centrum semiovale. MWF imaging from T2 relaxation suggests that myelination, particularly in the bilateral thalamus, splenium, and left hemisphere white matter, plays a role in reading abilities. Myelin water imaging thus provides a potentially valuable in vivo imaging tool for the study of dyslexia and its remediation.", "Governments must become active shapers of medical innovation and drive the development of critical health technologies as global health commons. The 'race' for COVID-19 vaccines is exposing the deficiencies of a business-as-usual medical innovation ecosystem driven by corporate interests, not health outcomes. Instead of bolstering collective intelligence, it relies on competition between proprietary vaccines and allows the bar on safety and efficacy to be lowered, risking people's health and undermining their trust.", "Clinical studies show that children exposed to anaesthetics for short times at young age perform normally on intelligence tests, but display altered social behaviours. In non-human primates (NHPs), infant anaesthesia exposure for several hours causes neurobehavioural impairments, including delayed motor reflex development and increased anxiety-related behaviours assessed by provoked response testing. However, the effects of anaesthesia on spontaneous social behaviours in juvenile NHPs have not been investigated. We hypothesised that multiple, but not single, 5 h isoflurane exposures in infant NHPs are associated with impairments in specific cognitive domains and altered social behaviours at juvenile age.\nEight Rhesus macaques per group were anaesthetised for 5 h using isoflurane one (1\u00d7) or three (3\u00d7) times between postnatal days 6 and 12 or were exposed to room air (control). Cognitive testing, behavioural assessments in the home environment, and provoked response testing were performed during the first 2 yr of life.\nThe cognitive functions tested did not differ amongst groups. However, compared to controls, NHPs in the 3\u00d7 group showed less close social behaviour (P=0.016), and NHPs in the 1\u00d7 group displayed increased anxiety-related behaviours (P=0.038) and were more inhibited towards novel objects (P<0.001).\n5 h exposures of NHPs to isoflurane during infancy are associated with decreased close social behaviour after multiple exposures and more anxiety-related behaviours and increased behavioural inhibition after single exposure, but they do not affect the cognitive domains tested. Our findings are consistent with behavioural alterations in social settings reported in clinical studies, which may guide future research.", "With the rapid development of the fields of data science and artificial intelligence, a dichotomy presents itself: more professionals are needed to fulfill the growing workfoce demand, and women continue to be underrepresented in all computer science-related jobs. Women AI Academy addresses both issues by inspiring, enabling, and targeting the employment of women in data science and artificial intelligence.", "The accurate differentiation between T1a and T1b Barrett's-related cancer has both therapeutic and prognostic implications but is challenging even for experienced physicians. We trained an artificial intelligence (AI) system on the basis of deep artificial neural networks (deep learning) to differentiate between T1a and T1b Barrett's cancer on white-light images.\nEndoscopic images from three tertiary care centers in Germany were collected retrospectively. A deep learning system was trained and tested using the principles of cross validation. A total of 230 white-light endoscopic images (108 T1a and 122 T1b) were evaluated using the AI system. For comparison, the images were also classified by experts specialized in endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of Barrett's cancer.\nThe sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and accuracy of the AI system in the differentiation between T1a and T1b cancer lesions was 0.77, 0.64, 0.74, and 0.71, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the performance of the AI system and that of experts, who showed sensitivity, specificity, F1, and accuracy of 0.63, 0.78, 0.67, and 0.70, respectively.\nThis pilot study demonstrates the first multicenter application of an AI-based system in the prediction of submucosal invasion in endoscopic images of Barrett's cancer. AI scored equally to international experts in the field, but more work is necessary to improve the system and apply it to video sequences and real-life settings. Nevertheless, the correct prediction of submucosal invasion in Barrett's cancer remains challenging for both experts and AI.", "To manage the COVID-19 pandemic, development of rapid, selective, sensitive diagnostic systems for early stage \u03b2-coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) virus protein detection is emerging as a necessary response to generate the bioinformatics needed for efficient smart diagnostics, optimization of therapy, and investigation of therapies of higher efficacy. The urgent need for such diagnostic systems is recommended by experts in order to achieve the mass and targeted SARS-CoV-2 detection required to manage the COVID-19 pandemic through the understanding of infection progression and timely therapy decisions. To achieve these tasks, there is a scope for developing smart sensors to rapidly and selectively detect SARS-CoV-2 protein at the picomolar level. COVID-19 infection, due to human-to-human transmission, demands diagnostics at the point-of-care (POC) without the need of experienced labor and sophisticated laboratories. Keeping the above-mentioned considerations, we propose to explore the compartmentalization approach by designing and developing nanoenabled miniaturized electrochemical biosensors to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus at the site of the epidemic as the best way to manage the pandemic. Such COVID-19 diagnostics approach based on a POC sensing technology can be interfaced with the Internet of things and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques (such as machine learning and deep learning for diagnostics) for investigating useful informatics via data storage, sharing, and analytics. Keeping COVID-19 management related challenges and aspects under consideration, our work in this review presents a collective approach involving electrochemical SARS-CoV-2 biosensing supported by AI to generate the bioinformatics needed for early stage COVID-19 diagnosis, correlation of viral load with pathogenesis, understanding of pandemic progression, therapy optimization, POC diagnostics, and diseases management in a personalized manner.", "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based sensors allow the evaluation of aqueous and gaseous solutions from real-time measurements of molecular interactions. The reliability of the response generated by a SPR sensor must be guaranteed, especially in substance detection, diagnoses, and other routine applications since poorly handled samples, instrumentation noise features, or even molecular tampering manipulations can lead to wrong interpretations. This work investigates the use of different machine learning (ML) techniques to deal with these issues, and aim to improve and attest to the quality of the real-time SPR responses so-called sensorgrams. A new strategy to describe a SPR-sensorgram is shown. The results of the proposed ML-approach allow the creation of intelligent SPR sensors to give a safe, reliable, and auditable analysis of sensorgram responses. Our arrangement can be embedded in an Intelligence Module that can classify sensorgrams and identify the substances presents in it. Also made it possible to order and analyze interest areas of sensorgrams, standardizing data, and supporting eventual audit procedures. With those intelligence features, the new generation of SPR-intelligent biosensors is qualifying to perform automated testing. A properly protocol for Leishmaniasis diagnosis with SPR was used to verify this new feature.", "Artificial intelligence, which has been actively applied in a broad range of industries in recent years, is an active area of interest for many researchers. Dentistry is no exception to this trend, and the applications of artificial intelligence are particularly promising in the field of oral and maxillofacial (OMF) radiology. Recent researches on artificial intelligence in OMF radiology have mainly used convolutional neural networks, which can perform image classification, detection, segmentation, registration, generation, and refinement. Artificial intelligence systems in this field have been developed for the purposes of radiographic diagnosis, image analysis, forensic dentistry, and image quality improvement. Tremendous amounts of data are needed to achieve good results, and involvement of OMF radiologist is essential for making accurate and consistent data sets, which is a time-consuming task. In order to widely use artificial intelligence in actual clinical practice in the future, there are lots of problems to be solved, such as building up a huge amount of fine-labeled open data set, understanding of the judgment criteria of artificial intelligence, and DICOM hacking threats using artificial intelligence. If solutions to these problems are presented with the development of artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence will develop further in the future and is expected to play an important role in the development of automatic diagnosis systems, the establishment of treatment plans, and the fabrication of treatment tools. OMF radiologists, as professionals who thoroughly understand the characteristics of radiographic images, will play a very important role in the development of artificial intelligence applications in this field.", "In this article, we develop the concept of Transparency by Design that serves as practical guidance in helping promote the beneficial functions of transparency while mitigating its challenges in automated-decision making (ADM) environments. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the ability of AI systems to make automated and self-learned decisions, a call for transparency of how such systems reach decisions has echoed within academic and policy circles. The term transparency, however, relates to multiple concepts, fulfills many functions, and holds different promises that struggle to be realized in concrete applications. Indeed, the complexity of transparency for ADM shows tension between transparency as a normative ideal and its translation to practical application. To address this tension, we first conduct a review of transparency, analyzing its challenges and limitations concerning automated decision-making practices. We then look at the lessons learned from the development of Privacy by Design, as a basis for developing the Transparency by Design principles. Finally, we propose a set of nine principles to cover relevant contextual, technical, informational, and stakeholder-sensitive considerations. Transparency by Design is a model that helps organizations design transparent AI systems, by integrating these principles in a step-by-step manner and as an ex-ante value, not as an afterthought.", "Interrogative suggestibility (IS) describes the extent to which an individual behavioral response is affected by messages communicated during formal questioning within a closed social interaction. The present study aimed at improving knowledge about IS in the elderly (aged 65 years and older), in particular about its association with both emotive/affective and cognitive variables. The sample (N = 172) was divided into three groups on the basis of age: late adult (aged 55-64, N = 59), young elderly (aged 65-74, N = 63), and elderly (aged 75 and older, N = 50). Cognitive (i.e., Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test-2, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test), emotive/affective (i.e., Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and suggestibility measures (i.e., Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale-2) were administered. In order to identify differences and associations between groups in IS, cognitive and emotive/affective variables, ANOVAs tests and Pearson's correlations were run. Furthermore, moderation analyses and hierarchical regression were set to determine whether age, cognitive and emotive/affective variables predicted IS components (i.e., Yield and Shift). Finally, machine learning models were developed to highlight the best strategy for classifying elderly subjects with high suggestibility. The results corroborated the significant link between IS and age, showing that elderly participants had the worst performance on all suggestibility indexes. Age was also the most important predictor of both Yield and Shift. Results also confirmed the important role of non-verbal intelligence and memory impairment in explaining IS dimensions, showing that these associations were stronger in young elderly and elderly groups. Implications about interrogative procedures with older adults were discussed.", "The current challenges of psychiatric nosology and semiology are part of an interdisciplinary and integrative framework. The paradigm of the personalized and precision psychiatry proposes to study this discipline according to new approaches and methodologies. Personalized and precision psychiatry therefore requires clarification of its concepts. To our knowledge, there is no systematic exploration of the literature on the application of the concepts of personalized and precision medicine in the field of psychiatry. This article proposes thus to explore the framework of personalized and precision medicine applied to psychiatry.\nWe explored the framework of personalized and precision medicine applied to psychiatry by a textual network analysis. Firstly, we performed a systematic text-mining (Natural Language Processing) from an exhaustive review of the international literature with the terms \"precision psychiatry\" and \"personalized psychiatry\". Secondly, this analysis of textual data allowed us to build a textual network which made it possible to visualize the most proximal terms (the most frequently associated in the literature). Finally, we extracted from the network the main dimensions explored in the scientific literature, and we studied the relative importance of each term by analyzing the network centrality. In addition, a brief bibliometric analysis was conducted.\nWe show that personalized and precision psychiatry refers to six dimensions found in the textual network analysis which correspond to the scientific fields which study personalized and precision psychiatry: genetics, pharmacogenetics, artificial intelligence, therapeutic trials, biomarkers and staging. We explore how each dimension relates to the mechanization of psychiatric disorders. However, precision and personalized psychiatry, which tries to refine the levels of mechanistic explanations for psychiatry, suffers from a conceptual heterogeneity. Indeed, textual analysis also allows us to find terms referring to a set of heterogeneous concepts. Many methodological fields and epistemological concepts are invoked in this literature, without standardization.\nThe paradox of personalized and precision psychiatry is to associate a strong conceptual heterogeneity with a well-defined mechanistic component. Heterogeneity found in literature on personalized and precision psychiatry testifies to the lack of a pluralist and integrative theoretical framework. This framework could be based on a naturalizing but non-reducing formalism, aware of the societal challenges of the sciences and their implementation in the research and clinical systems of psychiatry.", "Education has been suggested to be possibly the most consistent, robust, and durable method available for raising intelligence, but little is known about the genetic and environmental interplay underlying this association. Therefore, we investigated how school achievement, as measured by grade point average in lower secondary school at 15\u00a0years of age, moderated intelligence variation in young adulthood. The sample consisted of all Danish male twin pairs who had left lower secondary school since 2002 and appeared, typically at age 18, before a draft board through 2015 (N\u2009=\u20092660). Shared environmental variance unique to intelligence (10% of total variance) was found to be greater among individuals with poor school achievement. However, school achievement did not moderate the genetic influences or the non-shared environmental influences on intelligence. We discuss the implications of this in light of the constraints imposed by the statistical models we used.", "Through the big data intelligent algorithm and application of artificial intelligence in critically ill patients, the value of the combination of clinical real-time warning and artificial intelligence in critical care medicine was explored. Artificial intelligence was used to simulate human thinking by studying, calculating, and analyzing a large amount of critical illness data in the medical work, and integrate a large number of clinical monitoring and treatment data generated in critical care medicine. The necessity, feasibility, relevance, data learning and application architecture of the application of artificial intelligence in the early warning of critical illness in medical work were analyzed, thus to promote the pioneering application of real-time warning of critical illness in clinical medicine. The development of critical care medicine in medical work requires the integration of big data and artificial intelligence. Through real-time early warning, accurate and scientific intelligent application of medical data, the life threatening uncertainties in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients can be more effectively reduced and the success rate of the treatment of critically ill patients can be improved. The perfect combination of artificial intelligence technology and big data of critical care medicine can provide a favorable guarantee for the pioneering application of real-time warning of critical care medicine in clinical work.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has lead to catastrophic number of deaths and revealed that much work still remains with data and artificial intelligence. To fully comprehend the dynamics of a pandemic with relevance to artificial intelligence, a primer on global health concepts is first presented. Following this, various aspects of diagnosis and therapy and the relationship to artificial intelligence are presented along with a future projection of an ideal deployment of artificial intelligence in a pandemic. Final thoughts are made about lessons learned and what lies ahead.", "Up to half of all musculoskeletal injuries are investigated with plain radiographs. However, high rates of image interpretation error mean that novel solutions such as artificial intelligence (AI) are being explored.\nTo determine patient confidence in clinician-led radiograph interpretation, the perception of AI-assisted interpretation and management, and to identify factors which might influence these views.\nA novel questionnaire was distributed to patients attending fracture clinic in a large inner-city teaching hospital. Categorical and Likert scale questions were used to assess participant demographics, daily electronics use, pain score and perceptions towards AI used to assist in interpretation of their radiographs, and guide management.\n216 questionnaires were included (M=126, F=90). Significantly higher confidence in clinician rather than AI-assisted interpretation was observed (clinician=9.20, SD=1.27\u2009vs AI=7.06, SD=2.13), 95.4% reported favouring clinician over AI-performed interpretation in the event of disagreement.Small positive correlations were observed between younger age/educational achievement and confidence in AI-assistance. Students demonstrated similarly increased confidence (8.43, SD 1.80), and were over-represented in the minority who indicated a preference for AI-assessment over their clinicians (50%).\nParticipant's held the clinician's assessment in the highest regard and expressed a clear preference for it over the hypothetical AI assessment. However, robust confidence scores for the role of AI-assistance in interpreting skeletal imaging suggest patients view the technology favourably.Findings indicate that younger, more educated patients are potentially more comfortable with a role for AI-assistance however further research is needed to overcome the small number of responses on which these observations are based.", "Previous studies have shown that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate lower performance on creativity tasks. Yet, recent findings suggest that individuals with ASD are not necessarily impaired in verbal creativity, as measured by the novel metaphor generation task. The current study investigates verbal and figural creativity in 40 children with ASD (aged 11-14 years) and 39 peers with typical development (TD) (aged 11-15 years). We also tested the contribution of executive functions to the creative performance. A sentence completion questionnaire was used to test creative verbal generation, while a task of drawing non-existent objects was used to assess figural abilities. The results indicate that children with ASD generated a greater quantity of creative metaphors and showed greater use of a specific kind of representational change on the figural creativity task: cross-category insertions (e.g., a house with a tail). However, no correlation was found between the metaphor generation task and the use of cross-category insertions for either group. Results also showed that, whereas phonemic fluency contributed to the explained variance in novel metaphor generation in the ASD group, fluid intelligence, although only marginally, contributed to variance in novel metaphor generation in the TD group. These findings suggest that verbal creativity and figural creativity are two separate abilities relying on different cognitive resources. Our results show that those with ASD and TD differ in the cognitive abilities they use to perform the metaphor generation task. The research points to a unique creative cognition profile among children with ASD.", "The aim of the current paper was to investigate the influence of childbirth on parents' trait emotional intelligence (EI). A three-wave longitudinal research program (during the second trimester of pregnancy, at 6 months postpartum, and at 1 year postpartum) using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model with a hierarchical linear modeling was conducted on 204 parental couples with parental group (i.e., primiparous and multiparous parents) as a time-invariant predictor and the partner's EI development as a time-varying covariate. Results showed that parents' EI was stable, except for Self-Control that increases after childbirth. Moreover, there was a significant negative association between the actor's and the partner's development around childbirth. Childbirth pushes parents to function in dyad rather than individually. Compensatory effects may be observed between both parents in terms of emotional management of parenting: When one partner cannot cope emotionally with parenting, the other partner would compensate and better manage the emotional aspects of parenting. The discussion underlined the importance of the dyadic perspective in understanding the childbirth experience, specifically the parents' receptivity to variation in their partners' emotional levels.", "In recent years the advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been seen to play an important role in human well-being, in particular enabling novel forms of human-computer interaction for people with a disability. In this paper, we propose a sEMG-controlled 3D game that leverages a deep learning-based architecture for real-time gesture recognition. The 3D game experience developed in the study is focused on rehabilitation exercises, allowing individuals with certain disabilities to use low-cost sEMG sensors to control the game experience. For this purpose, we acquired a novel dataset of seven gestures using the Myo armband device, which we utilized to train the proposed deep learning model. The signals captured were used as an input of a Conv-GRU architecture to classify the gestures. Further, we ran a live system with the participation of different individuals and analyzed the neural network's classification for hand gestures. Finally, we also evaluated our system, testing it for 20 rounds with new participants and analyzed its results in a user study.", "Explainable artificial intelligence holds a great promise for neuroscience and plays an important role in the hypothesis generation process. We follow-up a recent machine learning-oriented study that constructed a deep convolutional neural network to automatically identify biological sex from EEG recordings in healthy individuals and highlighted the discriminative role of beta-band power. If generalizing, this finding would be relevant not only theoretically by pointing to some specific neurobiological sexual dimorphisms, but potentially also as a relevant confound in quantitative EEG diagnostic practice. To put this finding to test, we assess whether the automatic identification of biological sex generalizes to another dataset, particularly in the presence of a psychiatric disease, by testing the hypothesis of higher beta power in women compared to men on 134 patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. Moreover, we construct ROC curves and compare the performance of the classifiers in determining sex both before and after the antidepressant treatment. We replicate the observation of a significant difference in beta-band power between men and women, providing classification accuracy of nearly 77%. The difference was consistent across the majority of electrodes, however multivariate classification models did not generally improve the performance. Similar results were observed also after the antidepressant treatment (classification accuracy above 70%), further supporting the robustness of the initial finding.", "Verbal communication is one of the most sophisticated human motor skills reflecting both-the mental and physical health of an individual. Voice parameters and quality changes are usually secondary towards functional and/or structural laryngological alterations under specific systemic processes, syndrome and pathologies. These include but are not restricted to dry mouth and Sicca syndromes, body dehydration, hormonal alterations linked to pubertal, menopausal, and andropausal status, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal reflux, autoimmune diseases, endocrinologic disorders, underweight versus overweight and obesity, and diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, it is well-established that stress overload is a significant risk factor of cascading pathologies, including but not restricted to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancers. Our current study revealed voice perturbations under the stress overload as a potentially useful biomarker to identify individuals in suboptimal health conditions who might be strongly predisposed to associated pathologies. Contextually, extended surveys applied in the population might be useful to identify, for example, persons at high risk for respiratory complications under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19. Symptoms of dry mouth syndrome, disturbed microcirculation, altered sense regulation, shifted circadian rhythm, and low BMI were positively associated with voice perturbations under the stress overload. Their functional interrelationships and relevance for cascading associated pathologies are presented in the article. Automated analysis of voice recordings via artificial intelligence (AI) has a potential to derive digital biomarkers. Further, predictive machine learning models should be developed that allows for detecting a suboptimal health condition based on voice recordings, ideally in an automated manner using derived digital biomarkers. Follow-up stratification and monitoring of individuals in suboptimal health conditions are recommended using disease-specific cell-free nucleic acids (ccfDNA, ctDNA, mtDNA, miRNA) combined with metabolic patterns detected in body fluids. Application of the cost-effective targeted prevention within the phase of reversible health damage is recommended based on the individualised patient profiling.", "The global burden of MVC injuries and deaths among vulnerable road users, has led to the implementation of prevention programmes and policies at the local and national level. MVC epidemiological research is key to quantifying MVC burden, identifying risk factors and evaluating interventions. There are, however, several methodological considerations in MVC epidemiological research.\nThis manuscript collates and describes methodological considerations in MVC epidemiological research, using examples drawn from published studies, with a focus on the vulnerable road user population of children and adolescents.\nMethodological considerations in MVC epidemiological research include the availability and quality of data to measure counts and calculate event rates and challenges in evaluation related to study design, measurement and statistical analysis. Recommendations include innovative data collection (eg, naturalistic design, stepped-wedge clinical trials), combining data sources for a more comprehensive representation of collision events, and the use of machine learning/artificial intelligence for large data sets.\nMVC epidemiological research can be challenging at all levels: data capture and quality, study design, measurement and analysis. Addressing these challenges using innovative data collection and analysis methods is required.", "It is a general belief that the healthcare delivery system (HCDS) in Nigeria is bedevilled by frequent workers industrial actions, inter-professional rivalry among healthcare workers and insurance scheme mismanagement and corruption.\nThis study was aimed at comparing the health care system in Nigeria (a lower middle-income country) and the United Kingdom (a high-income country).\nUsing keywords including 'primary health care', 'secondary health care', 'tertiary health care', 'health care delivery system', 'Nigeria' and ''United Kingdom, PubMed was searched for studies on health care in Nigeria and the United Kingdom. Databases of the World Bank, World Health Organization, Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook and Index Mundi were also searched for information on health indices and organisational characteristics for Nigeria and the United Kingdom. Retrieved articles and data obtained were analysed and a two-country comparison was performed on HCDS features and health indices.\nThe average Life Expectancy in Nigeria is less than two third of that of the UK (54.8 years vs. 81.2 years) and the probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per thousands of population is 127.8% higher among Nigerians than among UK citizens. The Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births and the under-five children mortality rate is 16 and 23 times higher in Nigeria than in the UK. The probability of dying on or before the first year of life and before the age of five is 177% and 183% higher respectively, in Nigeria than in the UK. While the UK ranked within the top 2% -10% on health system rating features such as achievement of goals, health care services distribution and overall goal achievement on HCDS, Nigeria is ranked within the bottom 2%-5% in these measures.\nUsing the HCDS in the UK as a model, it can be argued that a multi-faceted approach that includes attitudinal and behavioural changes among the healthcare workers, proactive health and social policy implementation and monitoring, preventive and corrective anti-corruption measures, population control and increased healthcare spending may be needed to address challenges and improve Nigeria's healthcare rating and ranking among countries.", "It is unclear whether borderline intellectual functioning (bif) and/or a mild intellectual disability (mid) in patients receiving treatment in mental health care are being recognized by care providers.<br/> AIM: Exploratory study to register under-diagnosis of bif/mid in an outpatient clinic.<br/> METHOD: The number of patients diagnosed with bif/mid according to the electronic patient file (epd) was determined. From 11 August to 11 December 2015, all newly registered patients for outpatient treatment with an mbo-2 or lower educational level were screened for the possible presence of bif/mid applying the screener for intelligence and mild intellectual disability (scil). For all patients, their mental health care practitioner was asked if they suspected bif/mid. These percentages were compared. The sensitivity and specificity and the positive and negative predictive value (ppv and npv) of the opinion of the mental health care practitioners were determined.<br/> RESULTS: In the epd 2,8% of patients were diagnosed with bif, and 0,8% with mid. The percentage of suspected bif/mid of newly registered patients was 17,5%. The sensitivity of the assessors' opinion was 41%, the npv was 57%.<br/> CONCLUSION: In newly registered patients at an outpatient clinic bif and mid are important but frequently missed co-morbidities.", "Power-law scaling, a central concept in critical phenomena, is found to be useful in deep learning, where optimized test errors on handwritten digit examples converge as a power-law to zero with database size. For rapid decision making with one training epoch, each example is presented only once to the trained network, the power-law exponent increased with the number of hidden layers. For the largest dataset, the obtained test error was estimated to be in the proximity of state-of-the-art algorithms for large epoch numbers. Power-law scaling assists with key challenges found in current artificial intelligence applications and facilitates an a priori dataset size estimation to achieve a desired test accuracy. It establishes a benchmark for measuring training complexity and a quantitative hierarchy of machine learning tasks and algorithms.", "Nutrition plays a pivotal role in brain development throughout life. Sub-optimal intellectual ability and poor school performance are said to be among the long term effects of malnutrition. The aim of this study was to determine the association between nutritional status of the participants, their intelligence quotient (IQ) and academic performance.\nChildren aged 6-12 years who met the inclusion criteria were recruited from the public and private primary schools in the local government area using a proportionate multistage sampling technique. Weight and height were measured using standard protocols and interpreted as normal or abnormal using the World Health Organization AnthroPlus\u00ae. IQ was assessed using the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and was grouped into optimal and suboptimal. Academic performance was assessed using the past records of class assessment, and was classified into high, average and low academic performance. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to obtain data such as-age, gender, socioeconomic indices and family size of the study participants.\nThe prevalence of underweight, thinness (wasting), stunting, overweight and obesity were 2.0%, 3.6%, 2.1%, 6.7%, and 4.2%, respectively. Indices of over-nutrition were significantly associated with optimal IQ and good academic performance. There was a trend in the association between wasting and suboptimal intelligence [AOR (95%CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.5 (1.0-3.0), p\u00a0=\u00a00.06].\nAcute and chronic under-nutrition did not adversely affect the IQ and academic performance of the study population. The relationship between over-nutrition, IQ and academic performance disappeared when socio-economic status was controlled for.", "Background: COVID-19 has resulted in a rapid and significant adoption of telemedicine for acute conditions. Understanding whether patient demand will last after the pandemic helps providers and payers make informed decisions about whether to continue adopting telemedicine. Objective: We examine user experience as well as process and patient outcomes of using telemedicine for acute conditions during COVID-19 and assess how patient outcomes are affected by waiting times and demographics. Materials and Methods: A survey was conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk during June 17-29, 2020. Inclusion criteria were: (1) \u226518 years old, (2) residing in the United States, (3) used telemedicine for acute conditions after January, and 4) a human intelligence task approval rate of >95%. Process outcomes included patient waiting time with patient outcomes being satisfaction and future use intention. Bivariate analysis and regressions of the data were performed. Results: On average, respondents reported appointment wait time of 2.76 days and virtual office wait time of 19.44\u2009min. Overall, respondents reported moderate satisfaction (mean 5.08-5.35 of 7) and future use intention (mean 5.10-5.32 of 7). Over 72% of the respondents were satisfied and had future use intention. Females, heavier internet users, and those on the higher/lower ends of the education spectrum reported better patient outcomes. Patients \"visiting\" a doctor experiencing eye problems, vis-\u00e0-vis other ailments, reported lower satisfaction and intention. Waiting time negatively associates with satisfaction. Conclusions: Given the satisfactory outcomes, the high demand for telemedicine may continue after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, whether providers will continue to offer telemedicine visits may require more evidence.", "Little is known about the influence of mild intellectual disability/borderline intellectual functioning (mid/biF) or posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) on treatment results in severely mentally ill (smi). <br/> AIM: To investigate whether screeners determining mid/biF or ptsd are associated with less favorable treatment outcome in smi.<br/> METHOD: The screener for intelligence and learning disabilities (scil) was used to screen for mid/biF. The trauma screening questionnaire (tsq) was used to detect ptsd. Outcomes of these screeners were associated with repeated measures on the health of the nation outcome scales (HoNOS) in 628 smi at the Mental Care Centre of Oost Brabant.<br/> RESULTS: In 628 patients one or more HoNOS was acquired. In 352 (56%) patients a scil was acquired, in 334 (53%) patients a tsq. The largest improvement was observed in patients not meeting the criteria for mid/biF and/or ptsd. Less improvement was observed in patients with ptsd and a suspected iq between 70-85, estimated with the scil. No significant change on the HoNOS was observed in patients with an estimated iq below 70.<br/> CONCLUSION: Routine screening for mid/biF and ptsd symptoms is important for early recognition of the disorder, resulting in providing better treatment interventions for patients with mid/biF and ptsd.", "Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of variants for various traits, the causal variants and the mechanisms underlying the significant loci are largely unknown. In this study, we aim to predict non-coding variants that may functionally affect translation initiation through long-range chromatin interaction.\nBy incorporating the Hi-C data, we propose a novel and powerful deep learning model of artificial intelligence to classify interacting and non-interacting fragment pairs and predict the functional effects of sequence alteration of single nucleotide on chromatin interaction and thus on gene expression. The changes in chromatin interaction probability between the reference sequence and the altered sequence reflect the degree of functional impact for the variant. The model was effective and efficient with the classification of interacting and non-interacting fragment pairs. The predicted causal SNPs that had a larger impact on chromatin interaction were more likely to be identified by GWAS and eQTL analyses. We demonstrate that an integrative approach combining artificial intelligence-deep learning with high throughput experimental evidence of chromatin interaction leads to prioritizing the functional variants in disease- and phenotype-related loci and thus will greatly expedite uncover of the biological mechanism underlying the association identified in genomic studies.\nSource code used in data preparing and model training is available at the GitHub website (https://github.com/biocai/DeepHiC).\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "In recent years, with the rapid development of nano-biotechnology and biomedicine, people have provided new ideas and methods for disease diagnosis and treatment. Nano-sulfides with unique two-dimensional structures and special physicochemical properties have begun to be applied to biology and medical field. Relevant research results show that nano-sulfides have good effects in tumor photothermal treatment, in vivo multimodal imaging, antitumor drug delivery, biosensors and tissue engineering, showing their potential application value. In view of the broad application prospects of nano-sulfides in the field of nano-biomedicine, in the image reconstruction stage, before starting to use artificial intelligence algorithm models, first explore the application of iterative optimization algorithms in the process of magnetic resonance image reconstruction. Taking magnetic resonance imaging as an example, for the detected ligament trauma area, we use learned an artificial intelligence model for diagnosis of multiple ligament trauma of the knee joint and postoperative femoral nerve block.", "Modelling the influence of high-energy ionising radiation on the properties of materials with polymeric matrix using advanced artificial intelligence tools plays an important role in the research and development of new materials for various industrial applications. It also applies to effective modification of existing materials based on polymer matrices to achieve the desired properties. In the presented work, the effects of high-energy electron beam radiation with various doses on the dynamic mechanical properties of melamine resin, phenol-formaldehyde resin, and nitrile rubber blend have been studied over a wide temperature range. A new stiffness-temperature model based on Weibull statistics of the secondary bonds breaking during the relaxation transitions has been developed to quantitatively describe changes in the storage modulus with temperature and applied radiation dose until the onset of the temperature of the additional, thermally-induced polymerisation reactions. A global search real-coded genetic algorithm has been successfully applied to optimise the parameters of the developed model by minimising the sum-squared error. An excellent agreement between the modelled and experimental data has been found.", "Extreme gradient boosting methods outperform conventional machine-learning models. Here, we have developed the LEukemia Artificial intelligence Program (LEAP) with the extreme gradient boosting decision tree method for the optimal treatment recommendation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). A cohort of CML-CP patients was randomly divided into training/validation (N = 504) and test cohorts (N = 126). The training/validation cohort was used for 3-fold cross validation to develop the LEAP CML-CP model using 101 variables at diagnosis. The test cohort was then applied to the LEAP CML-CP model and an optimum TKI treatment was suggested for each patient. The area under the curve in the test cohort was 0.81899.Backward multivariate analysis identified age at diagnosis, the degree of comorbidities, and TKI recommended therapy by the LEAP CML-CP model as independent prognostic factors for overall survival. The bootstrapping method internally validated the association of the LEAP CML-CP recommendation with overall survival as an independent prognostic for overall survival. Selecting treatment according to the LEAP CML-CP personalized recommendations, in this model, is associated with better survival probability compared to treatment with a LEAP CML-CP non-recommended therapy. This approach may pave a way of new era of personalized treatment recommendations for patients with cancer.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been defined as a branch of computer science dealing with the capability and simulation of a machine to imitate intelligent human behaviour. Diagnostic radiology, being a computer-based service, is unsurprisingly at the forefront of the discussion of the use of AI in medicine. There are however differing schools of thought regarding its use; namely, will AI eventually replace the radiologist? Or indeed will it ever be fully capable of replacing radiology as a speciality, but rather be used as an aid to the profession whereby a human's input will always be required? Furthermore, what will the legal implications of AI in radiology mean to the profession? Who will be liable for missed diagnoses? Is it possible that the introduction of AI to radiology will in fact make the profession busier?", "This study aimed to investigate dominant predictor components of moral intelligence (MI) based on the Lennick and Kiel's model in students of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBMU). In this descriptive-analytical study, 322 students of SBMU were chosen through cluster sampling. To collect data, a 40-item questionnaire, whose validity and reliability was confirmed in previous studies, based on the Lennick and Kiel's model was used. The collected data were analyzed by SPSS 21 software using appropriate descriptive and analytical statistics. Of 322 participants, 180 and 142 were female and male, respectively. The mean age of the participants was 22.30\u00b12.69 years. The study's regression analysis revealed that the most and the least direct effects were related to the forgiveness (R2=0.320) and compassion (R2=0.284) components, respectively. Among the inspected components, the responsibility component with an overall effect of R2=0.655 was shown to be the strongest predictor component of MI. Universities play a significant role in students' moral development and enhancement. The present study's findings suggest that developing strategic plans and interventions can enhance MI level (e.g., incentive systems for individuals maintaining high moral responsibility). Since today's students will be tomorrow's medical and healthcare professionals, upgrading of MI level in students studying in various divisions of medical sciences enhances their moral responsibility through setting out strong ethics principles to follow and the quality of care that they will provide to patients, thereby improving health.", "Real-time relevant information helps guide the healthcare decision-making process in daily clinical practice as well as the management and optimization of healthcare processes. However, proprietary business intelligence suite solutions supporting the production of decision-making information requires investment that is out of reach of small and mediumsized healthcare facilities or those with limited resources, particularly in developing countries. This paper describes our experience in designing and implementing a real-time healthcare monitoring system solution to manage healthcare emergency units.\nThrough the use of free Business Intelligence tools and Python data science language we designed a real-time monitoring system, which was implemented to explore the Electronic Medical Records system of a university mental health emergency unit and render an electronic dashboard to support health professional daily practice.\nThree main dashboards were created to monitor patient waiting time, to access the clinical notes summary for the next waiting patient, and to obtain insights into activity during the last 24 hours.\nThe designed system could serve as a monitoring support model using free and user-friendly data science tools, which are good alternatives to proprietary business intelligence solutions and drastically reduce cost. Still, the key to success in decision-making systems is based on investment in human resources, business intelligence skills training, the organizational aspect of the decision-making process, and data production quality insurance.", "The 2020 International Web Scientific Event in COVID-19 pandemic in critically ill patients aimed at updating the information and knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic in the intensive care unit. Experts reviewed the latest literature relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in critically ill patients, such as epidemiology, pathophysiology, phenotypes of infection, COVID-19 as a systematic infection, molecular diagnosis, mechanical ventilation, thromboprophylaxis, COVID-19 associated co-infections, immunotherapy, plasma treatment, catheter-related bloodstream infections, artificial intelligence for COVID-19, and vaccination. Antiviral therapy and co-infections are out of the scope of this review. In this review, each of these issues is discussed with key messages regarding management and further research being presented after a brief review of available evidence.", "Language is a valuable source of clinical information in Alzheimer's disease, as it declines concurrently with neurodegeneration. Consequently, speech and language data have been extensively studied in connection with its diagnosis.\nFirstly, to summarize the existing findings on the use of artificial intelligence, speech, and language processing to predict cognitive decline in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Secondly, to detail current research procedures, highlight their limitations, and suggest strategies to address them.\nSystematic review of original research between 2000 and 2019, registered in PROSPERO (reference CRD42018116606). An interdisciplinary search covered six databases on engineering (ACM and IEEE), psychology (PsycINFO), medicine (PubMed and Embase), and Web of Science. Bibliographies of relevant papers were screened until December 2019.\nFrom 3,654 search results, 51 articles were selected against the eligibility criteria. Four tables summarize their findings: study details (aim, population, interventions, comparisons, methods, and outcomes), data details (size, type, modalities, annotation, balance, availability, and language of study), methodology (pre-processing, feature generation, machine learning, evaluation, and results), and clinical applicability (research implications, clinical potential, risk of bias, and strengths/limitations).\nPromising results are reported across nearly all 51 studies, but very few have been implemented in clinical research or practice. The main limitations of the field are poor standardization, limited comparability of results, and a degree of disconnect between study aims and clinical applications. Active attempts to close these gaps will support translation of future research into clinical practice.", "With the development of artificial intelligence technologies, robotic training partner is becoming a reality, which is a substitute for human training partner. Socially anxious individuals feel uncomfortable in front of unfamiliar people or when being observed by others. Playing with robotic training partners can avoid face-to-face interaction with other people. It is unclear whether social anxiety affects the adoption of robotic training partners. This study investigates the effect of social anxiety on the adoption of robotic training partners among university students. Study 1 confirmed that university students with higher social anxiety are more likely to choose robotic training partners than human training partners. Mediation analysis in Study 2 supported the mediating role of sense of relaxation with robotic training partner in the positive effect of social anxiety on the adoption of robotic training partner. This study shows that developing training partner robots is a meaningful thing for corporate profits and the health of socially anxious people.", "In order to better understand the deployment of the theory of mind (ToM) in Tunisian neurotypical children, we have developed a new tool of assessment of the ToM called the \"Tunisian Social Situations Instrument\" (TSSI). We opted for the creation of this test in view of the intercultural differences in the development of social skills. Our purpose was to validate this tool in general pediatric population.\nIt was a cross-sectional evaluative study that aimed to validate the TSSI in the general pediatric population. We initially conducted a beta test and a pre-validation study before taking the initial version of the TSSI on 123 neurotypical children. Then, we followed the typical validation procedure: appearance validity, content validity, construct validity, and reliability study.\nRegarding the validity of appearance, the TSSI was comprehensible and adapted to the Tunisian pediatric population. About content validity, the exploratory factor analysis extracted 6 factors that explain 69.3% of the total variance. These factors were respectively social clumsiness types 1 and 2, intention attribution, emotional ToM, epistemic ToM, and simple comprehension questions. The subdomains of social clumsiness (types 1 and 2) and emotional ToM had a Cronbach alpha higher than 0.8. This factor structure as well as the significant inter-correlation between subdomains and the global score were in favor of a good construct validity. The internal consistency study showed good reliability of the final version of the TSSI (alpha of Cronbach at 0,809). Regarding the performance of children at the TSSI, we have noticed a significant association between the global score, age, and verbal intelligence.\nThis work offers valuable insights about ToM and provides clinicians with a reliable tool to assess social clumsiness and emotional ToM in typically developing children.", "The most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis is infection by Group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), commonly known as strep throat. 5-15% of adults and 15-35% of children in the United States with pharyngitis have a GABHS infection. The symptoms of GABHS overlap with non-GABHS and viral causes of acute pharyngitis, complicating the problem of diagnosis. A careful physical examination and patient history is the starting point for diagnosing GABHS. After a physical examination and patient history is completed, five types of diagnostic methods can be used to ascertain the presence of a GABHS infection: clinical scoring systems, rapid antigen detection tests, throat culture, nucleic acid amplification tests, and machine learning and artificial intelligence. Clinical guidelines developed by professional associations can help medical professionals choose among available techniques to diagnose strep throat. However, guidelines for diagnosing GABHS created by the American and European professional associations vary significantly, and there is substantial evidence that most physicians do not follow any published guidelines. Treatment for GABHS using analgesics, antipyretics, and antibiotics seeks to provide symptom relief, shorten the duration of illness, prevent nonsuppurative and suppurative complications, and decrease the risk of contagion, while minimizing the unnecessary use of antibiotics. There is broad agreement that antibiotics with narrow spectrums of activity are appropriate for treating strep throat. But whether and when patients should be treated with antibiotics for GABHS remains a controversial question. There is no clearly superior management strategy for strep throat, as significant controversy exists regarding the best methods to diagnose GABHS and under what conditions antibiotics should be prescribed.", "The threat of criminal activity in the fisheries sector has concerned the international community for a number of years. In more recent times, the presence of organized crime in fisheries has come to the fore. In 2008, the United Nations General Assembly asked all states to contribute to increasing our understanding the connection between illegal fishing and transnational organized crime at sea. Policy-makers, researchers and members of civil society are increasing their knowledge of the dynamics and destructiveness of the blue shadow economy and the role of organized crime within this economy. Anecdotal, scientific and example-based evidence of the various manifestations of organized crime in fisheries, its widespread adverse impacts on economies, societies and the environment globally and its potential security consequences is now publicly available. Here we present the current state of knowledge on organized crime in the fisheries sector. We show how the many facets of organized crime in this sector, including fraud, drug trafficking and forced labour, hinder progress towards the development of a sustainable ocean economy. With reference to worldwide promising practices, we highlight practical opportunities for action to address the problem. We emphasize the need for a shared understanding of the challenge and for the implementation of intelligence-led, skills-based cooperative law enforcement action at a global level and a community-based approach for targeting organized crime in the supply chain of organized criminal networks at a local level, facilitated by legislative frameworks and increased transparency.", "Without doubt, artificial intelligence (AI) is the most discussed topic today in medical imaging research, both in diagnostic and therapeutic. For diagnostic imaging alone, the number of publications on AI has increased from about 100-150 per year in 2007-2008 to 1000-1100 per year in 2017-2018. Researchers have applied AI to automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and providing quantitative assessments of radiographic characteristics. In radiation oncology, AI has been applied on different image modalities that are used at different stages of the treatment. i.e. tumor delineation and treatment assessment. Radiomics, the extraction of a large number of image features from radiation images with a high-throughput approach, is one of the most popular research topics today in medical imaging research. AI is the essential boosting power of processing massive number of medical images and therefore uncovers disease characteristics that fail to be appreciated by the naked eyes. The objectives of this paper are to review the history of AI in medical imaging research, the current role, the challenges need to be resolved before AI can be adopted widely in the clinic, and the potential future.", "Previous work using logistic regression suggests that cognitive control-related frontoparietal activation in early psychosis can predict symptomatic improvement after 1\u2009year of coordinated specialty care with 66% accuracy. Here, we evaluated the ability of six machine learning (ML) algorithms and deep learning (DL) to predict \"Improver\" status (>20% improvement on Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] total score at 1-year follow-up vs. baseline) and continuous change in BPRS score using the same functional magnetic resonance imaging-based features (frontoparietal activations during the AX-continuous performance task) in the same sample (individuals with either schizophrenia (n\u2009= 65, 49M/16F, mean age 20.8\u2009years) or Type I bipolar disorder (n =\u200917, 9M/8F, mean age 21.6\u2009years)). 138 healthy controls were included as a reference group. \"Shallow\" ML methods included Naive Bayes, support vector machine, K Star, AdaBoost, J48 decision tree, and random forest. DL included an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) procedure for understanding results. The best overall performances (70% accuracy for the binary outcome and root mean square error = 9.47 for the continuous outcome) were achieved using DL. XAI revealed left DLPFC activation was the strongest feature used to make binary classification decisions, with a classification activation threshold (adjusted beta = .017) intermediate to the healthy control mean (adjusted beta = .15, 95% CI = -0.02 to 0.31) and patient mean (adjusted beta = -.13, 95% CI = -0.37 to 0.11). Our results suggest DL is more powerful than shallow ML methods for predicting symptomatic improvement. The left DLPFC may be a functional target for future biomarker development as its activation was particularly important for predicting improvement.", "Application and development of the artificial intelligence technology have generated a profound impact in the field of medical imaging. It helps medical personnel to make an early and more accurate diagnosis. Recently, the deep convolution neural network is emerging as a principal machine learning method in computer vision and has received significant attention in medical imaging. Key Message: In this paper, we will review recent advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep convolution neural network, focusing on their applications in medical image processing. To illustrate with a concrete example, we discuss in detail the architecture of a convolution neural network through visualization to help understand its internal working mechanism.\nThis review discusses several open questions, current trends, and critical challenges faced by medical image processing and artificial intelligence technology.", "The aim of this study was to validate the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS) in Chinese adolescents by examining factor structure, sex-related measurement invariance and latent mean differences, reliability, and criterion-related validity.A total of 1674 Chinese adolescents aged 12-17 years old (Mage\u2009=\u200915.26, SD\u2009=\u2009.58) were recruited. Results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the four-factor model of the WLEIS as the best fit to the data. Multi-group CFA suggested that the measurement structure of the WLEIS was invariant across sex. Testing for the latent mean differences showed that male adolescents scored lower on the Other-Emotional Appraisal subscale, but scored higher on the Regulation of Emotion subscale than female adolescents. Furthermore, all the subscales of male and female adolescents had satisfactory composite reliability. Finally, the WLEIS had favorable criterion-related validity with self-esteem, life satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect and perceived stress. These findings suggested that the WLEIS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing trait emotional intelligence of adolescents and can be generalized across sex.", "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability to align two types of retinal images taken on different platforms; color fundus (CF) photographs and infrared scanning laser ophthalmoscope (IR SLO) images using mathematical warping and artificial intelligence (AI).\nWe collected 109 matched pairs of CF and IR SLO images. An AI algorithm utilizing two separate networks was developed. A style transfer network (STN) was used to segment vessel structures. A registration network was used to align the segmented images to each. Neither network used a ground truth dataset. A conventional image warping algorithm was used as a control. Software displayed image pairs as a 5 \u00d7 5 checkerboard grid composed of alternating subimages. This technique permitted vessel alignment determination by human observers and 5 masked graders evaluated alignment by the AI and conventional warping in 25 fields for each image.\nOur new AI method was superior to conventional warping at generating vessel alignment as judged by masked human graders (P < 0.0001). The average number of good/excellent matches increased from 90.5% to 94.4% with AI method.\nAI permitted a more accurate overlay of CF and IR SLO images than conventional mathematical warping. This is a first step toward developing an AI that could allow overlay of all types of fundus images by utilizing vascular landmarks.\nThe ability to align and overlay imaging data from multiple instruments and manufacturers will permit better analysis of this complex data helping understand disease and predict treatment.", "Chemometrics play a critical role in biosensors-based detection, analysis, and diagnosis. Nowadays, as a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) have achieved impressive advances. However, novel advanced ML methods, especially deep learning, which is famous for image analysis, facial recognition, and speech recognition, has remained relatively elusive to the biosensor community. Herein, how ML can be beneficial to biosensors is systematically discussed. The advantages and drawbacks of most popular ML algorithms are summarized on the basis of sensing data analysis. Specially, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are emphasized. Diverse ML-assisted electrochemical biosensors, wearable electronics, SERS and other spectra-based biosensors, fluorescence biosensors and colorimetric biosensors are comprehensively discussed. Furthermore, biosensor networks and multibiosensor data fusion are introduced. This review will nicely bridge ML with biosensors, and greatly expand chemometrics for detection, analysis, and diagnosis.", "Thalamofrontal cortical network and limbic system are proposed to be involved in psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) and idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). This study aimed to investigate neurochemical changes in prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and limbic circuits in patients with PNES and IGE. We also analyzed the interaction between cognitive functions and neurochemical changes in both groups.\nHydrogen proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was used to measure N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), glutamate-glutamine (Glx), and myo-inositol (MI). The voxels were placed on the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and thalamus. Attention and inhibitory control, as well as general intelligence status, were investigated using the Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test (IVA-CPT) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), respectively, in patients with PNES and IGE, as well as healthy volunteers.\nThe 1H-MRS showed a decreased ratio of NAA/Cr in the right and left thalamus, right DMPFC, and right ACC in patients with IGE and PNES. Furthermore, a decrease of the NAA/Cr ratio in the left DMPFC and an increase of NAA/Cr ratio in the right DLPFC were observed in patients with PNES compared with the controls. The patient groups had a decreased ratio of Cho/Cr in right ACC compared with the healthy subjects. Moreover, the NAA/Cr ratio in the left thalamus and left DMPFC was correlated with seizure frequency in patient groups. Reduced NAA/Cr ratio in the right ACC and left DLPFC were also correlated with poor IVA-CPT scores.\nThis study highlighted the dysfunction in prefrontal-thalamic-limbic circuits and impairment in neurocognition in patients with PNES and IGE.", "Acceleration is an important consideration when imaging moving organs such as the heart. Not only does acceleration enable motion-free scans but, more importantly, it lies at the heart of capturing the dynamics of cardiac motion. For over three decades, various ingenious approaches have been devised and implemented for rapid CINE MRI suitable for dynamic cardiac imaging. Virtually all techniques relied on acquiring less data to reduce acquisition times. Parallel imaging was among the first of these innovations, using multiple receiver coils and mathematical algorithms for reconstruction; acceleration factors of 2 to 3 were readily achieved in clinical practice. However, in the context of imaging dynamic events, further decreases in scan time beyond those provided by parallel imaging were possible by exploiting temporal coherencies. This recognition ushered in the era of k-t accelerated MRI, which utilized predominantly statistical methods for image reconstruction from highly undersampled k-space. Despite the successes of k-t acceleration methods, however, the accuracy of reconstruction was not always guaranteed. To address this gap, MR physicists and mathematicians applied compressed sensing theory to ensure reconstruction accuracy. Reconstruction was, indeed, more robust, but it required optimizing regularization parameters and long reconstruction times. To solve the limitations of all previous methods, researchers have turned to artificial intelligence and deep neural networks for the better part of the past decade, with recent results showing rapid, robust reconstruction. This review provides a comprehensive overview of key developments in the history of CINE MRI acceleration, and offers a unique and intuitive explanation behind the techniques and underlying mathematics.Level of Evidence: 5Technical Efficacy Stage: 1.", "Here we look at popular trends and concepts in toxicology over the decade 2009-2019. The top 10 concepts included methodological approaches such as zebrafish and genomics as well as broader concepts such as personalized medicine and adverse outcome pathways. The total number and rank order for each of the top 10 were tracked year by year via PubMed with >9500 papers contributing to the analysis. The data revealed a slow upward trend in the number of papers across all the concepts from 260 in 2009 to >1700 in 2019. Zebrafish, genomics and personalized medicine remained in the top four slots since 2009 with zebrafish dominating the rankings over the entire decade. Genomics was a strong second until 2013 when it was displaced first by the microbiome in 2014 and secondly by personalized medicine in 2015. Other notable trends were the ascendancy of the microbiome and adverse outcome pathways and the descendancy of hormesis and the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement of animals in testing). The observation that the top four slots have been static over the past 4\u00a0years suggests that new ideas are introduced and increase in popularity until they find their place in scientific culture. This may suggest that relatively new concepts such as artificial intelligence and microphysiological systems have yet to find their steady state in the rankings. Similarly, as a relatively new player in toxicology, the full impact of the human microbiome on drug efficacy and safety remains to be seen.", "Recent advancements in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things (IoT) create new opportunities for autonomous industrial environments monitoring. Nevertheless, detecting anomalies in harsh industrial settings remains challenging. This paper proposes an edge-fog-cloud architecture with mobile IoT edge nodes carried on autonomous robots for thermal anomalies detection in aluminum factories. We use companion drones as fog nodes to deliver first response services and a cloud back-end for thermal anomalies analysis. We also propose a self-driving deep learning architecture and a thermal anomalies detection and visualization algorithm. Our results show our robot surveyors are low-cost, deliver reduced response time, and more accurately detect anomalies compared to human surveyors or fixed IoT nodes monitoring the same industrial area. Our self-driving architecture has a root mean square error of 0.19 comparable to VGG-19 with a significantly reduced complexity and three times the frame rate at 60 frames per second. Our thermal to visual registration algorithm maximizes mutual information in the image-gradient domain while adapting to different resolutions and camera frame rates.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare-with radiology at the pioneering forefront. To be trustfully adopted, AI needs to be lawful, ethical and robust. This article covers the different aspects of a safe and sustainable deployment of AI in radiology during: training, integration and regulation. For training, data must be appropriately valued, and deals with AI companies must be centralized. Companies must clearly define anonymization and consent, and patients must be well-informed about their data usage. Data fed into algorithms must be made AI-ready by refining, purification, digitization and centralization. Finally, data must represent various demographics. AI needs to be safely integrated with radiologists-in-the-loop: guiding forming concepts of AI solutions and supervising training and feedback. To be well-regulated, AI systems must be approved by a health authority and agreements must be made upon liability for errors, roles of supervised and unsupervised AI and fair workforce distribution (between AI and radiologists), with a renewal of policy at regular intervals. Any errors made must have a root-cause analysis, with outcomes fedback to companies to close the loop-thus enabling a dynamic best prediction system. In the distant future, AI may act autonomously with little human supervision. Ethical training and integration can ensure a \"transparent\" technology that will allow insight: helping us reflect on our current understanding of imaging interpretation and fill knowledge gaps, eventually moulding radiological practice. This article proposes recommendations for ethical practise that can guide a nationalized framework to build a sustainable and transparent system.", "The running segment of a triathlon produces 70% of the lower limb injuries. Previous research has shown a clear association between kinematic patterns and specific injuries during running.\nAfter completing a seven-month gait retraining program, a questionnaire was used to assess 19 triathletes for the incidence of injuries. They were also biomechanically analyzed at the beginning and end of the program while running at a speed of 90% of their maximum aerobic speed (MAS) using surface sensor dynamic electromyography and kinematic analysis. We used classification tree (random forest) techniques from the field of artificial intelligence to identify linear and non-linear relationships between different biomechanical patterns and injuries to identify which styles best prevent injuries.\nFewer injuries occurred after completing the program, with athletes showing less pelvic fall and greater activation in gluteus medius during the first phase of the float phase, with increased trunk extension, knee flexion, and decreased ankle dorsiflexion during the initial contact with the ground.\nThe triathletes who had suffered the most injuries ran with increased pelvic drop and less activation in gluteus medius during the first phase of the float phase. Contralateral pelvic drop seems to be an important variable in the incidence of injuries in young triathletes.", "Tumor stage and grade, visually assessed by pathologists from evaluation of pathology images in conjunction with radiographic imaging techniques, have been linked to outcome, progression, and survival for a number of cancers. The gold standard of staging in oncology has been the TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) staging system. Though histopathological grading has shown prognostic significance, it is subjective and limited by interobserver variability even among experienced surgical pathologists. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been applied to pathology images toward diagnostic-, prognostic-, and treatment prediction-related tasks in cancer. AI approaches have the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional TNM staging and tumor grading approaches, providing a direct prognostic prediction of disease outcome independent of tumor stage and grade. Broadly speaking, these AI approaches involve extracting patterns from images that are then compared against previously defined disease signatures. These patterns are typically categorized as either (1) handcrafted, which involve domain-inspired attributes, such as nuclear shape, or (2) deep learning (DL)-based representations, which tend to be more abstract. DL approaches have particularly gained considerable popularity because of the minimal domain knowledge needed for training, mostly only requiring annotated examples corresponding to the categories of interest. In this article, we discuss AI approaches for digital pathology, especially as they relate to disease prognosis, prediction of genomic and molecular alterations in the tumor, and prediction of treatment response in oncology. We also discuss some of the potential challenges with validation, interpretability, and reimbursement that must be addressed before widespread clinical deployment. The article concludes with a brief discussion of potential future opportunities in the field of AI for digital pathology and oncology.", "Dental caries is the most prevalent dental disease worldwide, and neural networks and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in the field of dentistry. This systematic review aims to identify the state of the art of neural networks in caries detection and diagnosis. A search was conducted in PubMed, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. The quality of the selected studies was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook tool. Thirteen studies were included. Most of the included studies employed periapical, near-infrared light transillumination, and bitewing radiography. The image databases ranged from 87 to 3000 images, with a mean of 669 images. Seven of the included studies labeled the dental caries in each image by experienced dentists. Not all of the studies detailed how caries was defined, and not all detailed the type of carious lesion detected. Each study included in this review used a different neural network and different outcome metrics. All this variability complicates the conclusions that can be made about the reliability or not of a neural network to detect and diagnose caries. A comparison between neural network and dentist results is also necessary.", "The purpose of this study was to summarize and evaluate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms used in geographic atrophy (GA) diagnostic processes (e.g. isolating lesions or disease progression).\nThe search strategy and selection of publications were both conducted in accordance with the Preferred of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and Web of Science were used to extract literary data. The algorithms were summarized by objective, performance, and scope of coverage of GA diagnosis (e.g. lesion automation and GA progression).\nTwenty-seven studies were identified for this review. A total of 18 publications focused on lesion segmentation only, 2 were designed to detect and classify GA, 2 were designed to predict future overall GA progression, 3 focused on prediction of future spatial GA progression, and 2 focused on prediction of visual function in GA. GA-related algorithms reported sensitivities from 0.47 to 0.98, specificities from 0.73 to 0.99, accuracies from 0.42 to 0.995, and Dice coefficients from 0.66 to 0.89.\nCurrent GA-AI publications have a predominant focus on lesion segmentation and a minor focus on classification and progression analysis. AI could be applied to other facets of GA diagnoses, such as understanding the role of hyperfluorescent areas in GA. Using AI for GA has several advantages, including improved diagnostic accuracy and faster processing speeds.\nAI can be used to quantify GA lesions and therefore allows one to impute visual function and quality-of-life. However, there is a need for the development of reliable and objective models and software to predict the rate of GA progression and to quantify improvements due to interventions.", "Intelligence has been declared as a necessary but not sufficient condition for creativity, which was subsequently (erroneously) translated into the so-called threshold hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts a change in the correlation between creativity and intelligence at around 1.33 standard deviations above the population mean. A closer inspection of previous inconclusive results suggests that the heterogeneity is mostly due to the use of suboptimal data analytical procedures. Herein, we applied and compared three methods that allowed us to handle intelligence as a continuous variable. In more detail, we examined the threshold of the creativity-intelligence relation with (a) scatterplots and heteroscedasticity analysis, (b) segmented regression analysis, and (c) local structural equation models in two multivariate studies (N1 = 456; N2 = 438). We found no evidence for the threshold hypothesis of creativity across different analytical procedures in both studies. Given the problematic history of the threshold hypothesis and its unequivocal rejection with appropriate multivariate methods, we recommend the total abandonment of the threshold.", "Poor quality and low repeatability of additively manufactured parts are key technological obstacles for the widespread adoption of additive manufacturing (AM). In-situ monitoring and control of the AM process is vital to overcome this problem. This paper describes the combined artificial intelligence and plasma emission spectroscopy to identify the porosity of AM parts during the process. The time- and position-synchronized spectra were collected during the directed energy deposition (DED) manufacturing process of a 7075-Al alloy part. Eighteen features extracted from spectra were coupled with the deposition qualities which were characterized by the 3D X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scan\u00a0and used to train a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The well-trained RF classifier achieved up to 83% precision for the porosity recognition of depositions. The feature importance recorded by the RF classifier indicates that the intensities of spectra at the wavelength of 414.234 (Fe I) nm and 396.054 (Al I) nm, and the kurtosis of spectra at wavelength ranges of 484-490\u00a0nm and 508-518\u00a0nm, are the most effective features for porosity recognition. The physical correlations between spectra, porosity formation, and thermal accumulation during the AM process were analyzed. This study demonstrates the great potentials, as well as challenges of plasma emission spectroscopy for in-situ quality monitoring of laser AM which allows the enhancement of AM technique.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in 2019 and disseminated around the world rapidly. Computed tomography (CT) imaging has been proven to be an important tool for screening, disease quantification and staging. The latter is of extreme importance for organizational anticipation (availability of intensive care unit beds, patient management planning) as well as to accelerate drug development through rapid, reproducible and quantified assessment of treatment response. Even if currently there are no specific guidelines for the staging of the patients, CT together with some clinical and biological biomarkers are used. In this study, we collected a multi-center cohort and we investigated the use of medical imaging and artificial intelligence for disease quantification, staging and outcome prediction. Our approach relies on automatic deep learning-based disease quantification using an ensemble of architectures, and a data-driven consensus for the staging and outcome prediction of the patients fusing imaging biomarkers with clinical and biological attributes. Highly promising results on multiple external/independent evaluation cohorts as well as comparisons with expert human readers demonstrate the potentials of our approach.", "The cancellation of large numbers of surgical procedures because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has drastically extended wait lists and negatively affected patient care and experience. As many facilities resume clinical work owing to the currently low burden of disease in our community, we are faced with operative booking protocols and procedures that are not mathematically designed to optimize efficiency. Using a subset of artificial intelligence called \"machine learning,\" we have shown how the use of operating time can be optimized with a custom Python (a high-level programming language) script and an open source machine-learning algorithm, the ORTools software suite from the Google AI division of Alphabet Inc. This allowed the creation of customized models to optimize the efficiency of operating room booking times, which resulted in a reduction in nursing overtime of 21% - a theoretical cost savings of $469 000 over 3 years.", "One of the major challenges in controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is its asymptomatic transmission. The pathogenicity and virulence of asymptomatic COVID-19 remain mysterious. On the basis of the genotyping of 75775 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates, we reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to SARS-CoV-2 11083G>T mutation (i.e., L37F at nonstructure protein 6 (NSP6)). By analyzing the distribution of 11083G>T in various countries, we unveil that 11083G>T may correlate with the hypotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we show a global decaying tendency of the 11083G>T mutation ratio indicating that 11083G>T hinders the SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity. Artificial intelligence, sequence alignment, and network analysis are applied to show that NSP6 mutation L37F may have compromised the virus's ability to undermine the innate cellular defense against viral infection via autophagy regulation. This assessment is in good agreement with our genotyping of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission across various countries and regions over the past few months.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has found its way into clinical studies in the era of big data. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury (ALI) is a clinical syndrome that encompasses a heterogeneous population. Management of such heterogeneous patient population is a big challenge for clinicians. With accumulating ALI datasets being publicly available, more knowledge could be discovered with sophisticated analytics. We reviewed literatures with big data analytics to understand the role of AI for improving the caring of patients with ALI/ARDS. Many studies have utilized the electronic medical records (EMR) data for the identification and prognostication of ARDS patients. As increasing number of ARDS clinical trials data is open to public, secondary analysis on these combined datasets provide a powerful way of finding solution to clinical questions with a new perspective. AI techniques such as Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and artificial neural networks (ANN) have also been successfully used in the investigation of ARDS problems. Individualized treatment of ARDS could be implemented with a support from AI as we are now able to classify ARDS into many subphenotypes by unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Interestingly, these subphenotypes show different responses to a certain intervention. However, current analytics involving ARDS have not fully incorporated information from omics such as transcriptome, proteomics, daily activities and environmental conditions. AI technology is assisting us to interpret complex data of ARDS patients and enable us to further improve the management of ARDS patients in future with individual treatment plans.", "Although the genetic influence on voter turnout is substantial (typically 40-50%), the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Across the social sciences, research suggests that 'resources for politics' (as indexed notably by educational attainment and intelligence test performance) constitute a central cluster of factors that predict electoral participation. Educational attainment and intelligence test performance are heritable. This suggests that the genotypes that enhance these phenotypes could positively predict turnout. To test this, we conduct a genome-wide complex trait analysis of individual-level turnout. We use two samples from the Danish iPSYCH case-cohort study, including a nationally representative sample as well as a sample of individuals who are particularly vulnerable to political alienation due to psychiatric conditions (n\u2009=\u200913,884 and n\u2009=\u200933,062, respectively). Using validated individual-level turnout data from the administrative records at the polling station, genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization, we show that there is a substantial genetic overlap between voter turnout and both educational attainment and intelligence test performance.", "The study tested the hypotheses that boys will have an advantage learning the fractions number line and this advantage will be mediated by spatial abilities. Fractions number line and, as a contrast, fractions arithmetic performance were assessed for 342 adolescents, as was their intelligence, working memory, and various spatial abilities. Boys showed smaller placement errors on the fractions number line (d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.22) and correctly solved more fractions arithmetic problems (d\u00a0=\u00a00.23) than girls. Working memory and intelligence predicted performance on both fractions measures, and a measure of visuospatial attention uniquely predicted number line performance and fully mediated the sex difference. Visuospatial working memory uniquely predicted fractions arithmetic performance and fully mediated the sex difference. The results help to clarify the nuanced relations between spatial abilities and formal mathematics learning and the sex differences that often emerge in mathematical domains that have a visuospatial component.", "While multi-level molecular \"omic\" analyses have undoubtedly increased the sophistication and depth with which we can understand cancer biology, the challenge is to make this overwhelming wealth of data relevant to the clinician and the individual patient. Bridging this gap serves as the cornerstone of precision medicine, yet the expense and difficulty of executing and interpreting these molecular studies make it impractical to routinely implement them in the clinical setting. Herein, we propose that machine learning may hold the key to guiding the future of precision oncology accurately and efficiently. Training deep learning models to interpret the histopathologic or radiographic appearance of tumors and their microenvironment-a phenotypic microcosm of their inherent molecular biology-has the potential to output relevant diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic patient-level data. This type of artificial intelligence framework may effectively shape the future of precision oncology by fostering multidisciplinary collaboration.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) includes the ability to evaluate and govern the emotions of oneself and others. Limited evidence exists in determining whether EI is related to professionalism.\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether relationships exist between EI and professionalism among undergraduate dental hygiene students.\nUsing a quantitative cross-sectional survey research design, the study instrument consisted of 3 parts: (1) The Emotional Quotient Self-Assessment Checklist (EQSAC) included 30 questions measuring 6 domains of EI; (2) The Patient Management and Professionalism Scale (PMPS) included 10 questions measuring 5 domains of professionalism; and (3) Demographic questions. Descriptive statistics, correlational statistics, and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the data.\nThe responses from 49 participants were used, which represented a response rate of 80.3%. Most undergraduate dental hygiene student participants had EI and professionalism scores in the moderate range. Total EI scores were significant predictors of total professionalism scores (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and EI domain scores were found to be significant predictors of professionalism domain scores (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).\nSince EI was found to be a predictor of professionalism, improving EI levels may bolster the development of professionalism among undergraduate dental hygiene students. Further research should utilize a larger population of dental hygiene students across multiple institutions.", "Dynamic and precise estimation of blood loss (EBL) is quite important for perioperative management. To date, the Triton System, based on feature extraction technology (FET), has been applied to estimate intra-operative haemoglobin (Hb) loss but is unable to directly assess the amount of blood loss. We aimed to develop a method for the dynamic and precise EBL and estimate Hb loss (EHL) based on artificial intelligence (AI).\nWe collected surgical patients' non-recycled blood to generate blood-soaked sponges at a set gradient of volume. After image acquisition and preprocessing, FET and densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet) were applied for EBL and EHL. The accuracy was evaluated using R2, the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean square error (MSE), and the Bland-Altman analysis.\nFor EBL, the R2, MAE and MSE for the method based on DenseNet were 0.966 (95% CI: 0.962-0.971), 0.186 (95% CI: 0.167-0.207) and 0.096 (95% CI: 0.084-0.109), respectively. For EHL, the R2, MAE and MSE for the method based on DenseNet were 0.941 (95% CI: 0.934-0.948), 0.325 (95% CI: 0.293-0.355) and 0.284 (95% CI: 0.251-0.317), respectively. The accuracies of EBL and EHL based on DenseNet were more satisfactory than that of FET. Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias of 0.02 ml with narrow limits of agreement (LOA) (-0.47 to 0.52 mL) and of 0.05 g with narrow LOA (-0.87 to 0.97 g) between the methods based on DenseNet and actual blood loss and Hb loss.\nWe developed a simpler and more accurate AI-based method for EBL and EHL, which may be more fit for surgeries primarily using sponges and with a small to medium amount of blood loss.", "Machine-learning (ML) algorithms allow for improved prediction of sepsis syndromes in the ED using data from electronic medical records. Transfer learning, a new subfield of ML, allows for generalizability of an algorithm across clinical sites. We aimed to validate the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert (AISE) for the prediction of delayed septic shock in a cohort of patients treated in the ED and demonstrate the feasibility of transfer learning to improve external validity at a second site.\nObservational cohort study utilizing data from over 180,000 patients from two academic medical centers between 2014 and 2019 using multiple definitions of sepsis. The AISE algorithm was trained using 40 input variables at the development site to predict delayed septic shock (occurring greater than 4 hours after ED triage) at varying prediction windows. We then validated the AISE algorithm at a second site using transfer learning to demonstrate generalizability of the algorithm.\nWe identified 9354 patients with severe sepsis of which 723 developed septic shock at least 4 hours after triage. The AISE algorithm demonstrated excellent area under the receiver operating curve (>0.8) at 8 and 12 hours for the prediction of delayed septic shock. Transfer learning significantly improved the test characteristics of the AISE algorithm and yielded comparable performance at the validation site.\nThe AISE algorithm accurately predicted the development of delayed septic shock. The use of transfer learning allowed for significantly improved external validity and generalizability at a second site. Future prospective studies are indicated to evaluate the clinical utility of this model.", "Live sheep export has become a public concern. This study aimed to test a non-contact biometric system based on artificial intelligence to assess heat stress of sheep to be potentially used as automated animal welfare assessment in farms and while in transport. Skin temperature (\u00b0C) from head features were extracted from infrared thermal videos (IRTV) using automated tracking algorithms. Two parameter engineering procedures from RGB videos were performed to assess Heart Rate (HR) in beats per minute (BPM) and respiration rate (RR) in breaths per minute (BrPM): (i) using changes in luminosity of the green (G) channel and (ii) changes in the green to red (a) from the CIELAB color scale. A supervised machine learning (ML) classification model was developed using raw RR parameters as inputs to classify cutoff frequencies for low, medium, and high respiration rate (Model 1). A supervised ML regression model was developed using raw HR and RR parameters from Model 1 (Model 2). Results showed that Models 1 and 2 were highly accurate in the estimation of RR frequency level with 96% overall accuracy (Model 1), and HR and RR with R = 0.94 and slope = 0.76 (Model 2) without statistical signs of overfitting.", "Background: Research on predictors of working memory training responsiveness, which could help tailor cognitive interventions individually, is a timely topic in healthy aging. However, the findings are highly heterogeneous, reporting partly conflicting results following a broad spectrum of methodological approaches to answer the question \"who benefits most\" from working memory training. Objective: The present systematic review aimed to systematically investigate prognostic factors and models for working memory training responsiveness in healthy older adults. Method: Four online databases were searched up to October 2019 (MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO). The inclusion criteria for full texts were publication in a peer-reviewed journal in English/German, inclusion of healthy older individuals aged \u226555 years without any neurological and/or psychiatric diseases including cognitive impairment, and the investigation of prognostic factors and/or models for training responsiveness after targeted working memory training in terms of direct training effects, near-transfer effects to verbal and visuospatial working memory as well as far-transfer effects to other cognitive domains and behavioral variables. The study design was not limited to randomized controlled trials. Results: A total of 16 studies including n = 675 healthy older individuals with a mean age of 63.0-86.8 years were included in this review. Within these studies, five prognostic model approaches and 18 factor finding approaches were reported. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies checklist, indicating that important information, especially regarding the domains study attrition, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting, was lacking throughout many of the investigated studies. Age, education, intelligence, and baseline performance in working memory or other cognitive domains were frequently investigated predictors across studies. Conclusions: Given the methodological shortcomings of the included studies, no clear conclusions can be drawn, and emerging patterns of prognostic effects will have to survive sound methodological replication in future attempts to promote precision medicine approaches in the context of working memory training. Methodological considerations are discussed, and our findings are embedded to the cognitive aging literature, considering, for example, the cognitive reserve framework and the compensation vs. magnification account. The need for personalized cognitive prevention and intervention methods to counteract cognitive decline in the aging population is high and the potential enormous. Registration: PROSPERO, ID CRD42019142750.", "This paper describes the design and construction of a remotely controlled mobile interference device designed primarily for interference (jamming) and immunity testing of wireless sensors operating in the 2.4 GHz band (Wi-Fi). The main idea was to build a remotely controlled test device to test the immunity of wireless sensors operating in the 2.4 GHz band directly in field conditions. The remotely controlled mobile interference device is equipped with a special interference apparatus, using a special magnetron tube as a source of interference. Magnetron was selected due to its high performance, allowing interference with wireless sensors over long distances. As magnetron is powered by high voltage (3 kVDC) and is being used in a remotely controlled device, it was important to solve the issue of its power supply using an accumulator. The remotely controlled device was further equipped with the option of detecting and analysing signals in the frequency band of 1 GHz to 18 GHz, adding an extra operational mode that can be used in civil (commercial), industrial, and military applications. Detection and analysis of extraneous signals that may affect our various electronic devices, operating in the 1 GHz to 18 GHz frequency band, is very important. By detecting and analyzing the detected signal, it is possible to recognize what kind of foreign device is transmitting on the detected frequency and how much it can affect the proper functioning of our electronic devices. All the individual parts of the remotely controlled mobile interference device are described in this article in detail, including their optimization for maximum use of the accumulator capacity by which the remotely controlled mobile interference device is powered. A substantial part of this article is devoted to optimizing the interference apparatus power supply with a resonant converter and internal intelligence, where the accumulators' capacity is measured to gain needed predictions for maximum use of Li-Po batteries and thus extending its time of use.", "For decades, biologists have relied on software to visualize and interpret imaging data. As techniques for acquiring images increase in complexity, resulting in larger multidimensional datasets, imaging software must adapt. ImageJ is an open-source image analysis software platform that has aided researchers with a variety of image analysis applications, driven mainly by engaged and collaborative user and developer communities. The close collaboration between programmers and users has resulted in adaptations to accommodate new challenges in image analysis that address the needs of ImageJ's diverse user base. ImageJ consists of many components, some relevant primarily for developers and a vast collection of user-centric plugins. It is available in many forms, including the widely used Fiji distribution. We refer to this entire ImageJ codebase and community as the ImageJ ecosystem. Here we review the core features of this ecosystem and highlight how ImageJ has responded to imaging technology advancements with new plugins and tools in recent years. These plugins and tools have been developed to address user needs in several areas such as visualization, segmentation, and tracking of biological entities in large, complex datasets. Moreover, new capabilities for deep learning are being added to ImageJ, reflecting a shift in the bioimage analysis community towards exploiting artificial intelligence. These new tools have been facilitated by profound architectural changes to the ImageJ core brought about by the ImageJ2 project. Therefore, we also discuss the contributions of ImageJ2 to enhancing multidimensional image processing and interoperability in the ImageJ ecosystem.", "Advances in Machine Learning and availability of state-of-the-art computational resources, along with digitized healthcare data, have set the stage for extensive application of artificial intelligence in the realm of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical decision support, personalized treatment options, drug development, and the field of biomedicine. Here, we discuss the application of Machine Learning algorithms in patient healthcare and dermatological domains along with the ethical complexities that are involved. In scientific studies, ethical challenges were initially not addressed proportionally (as assessed by keyword counts in PubMed) and just more recently (since 2016) this has started to improve. Few pioneering countries have created regulatory guidelines around how to respect matters of (1) privacy, (2) fairness, (3) accountability, (4) transparency and (5) conflict of interest when developing novel medical Machine Learning applications. While there is a strong promise of emerging medical applications to ultimately benefit both the patients and the medical practitioners, it is important to raise awareness on the five key ethical issues and incorporate them into medical practice in the near future.", "Currently, there is no objective, clinically available tool for the accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is a pressing need for a novel, minimally invasive, cost friendly, and easily accessible tool to diagnose AD, assess disease severity, and prognosticate course. Metabolomics is a promising tool for discovery of new, biologically, and clinically relevant biomarkers for AD detection and classification.\nUtilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning, we aim to assess whether a panel of metabolites as detected in plasma can be used as an objective and clinically feasible tool for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.\nUsing a community-based sample cohort acquired from different sites across the US, we adopted an approach combining Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H NMR), Liquid Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and various machine learning statistical approaches to identify a biomarker panel capable of identifying those patients with AD and MCI from healthy controls.\nOf the 212 measured metabolites, 5 were identified as optimal to discriminate between controls, and individuals with MCI or AD. Our models performed with AUC values in the range of 0.72-0.76, with the sensitivity and specificity values ranging from 0.75-0.85 and 0.69-0.81, respectively. Univariate and pathway analysis identified lipid metabolism as the most perturbed biochemical pathway in MCI and AD.\nA comprehensive method of acquiring metabolomics data, coupled with machine learning techniques, has identified a strong panel of diagnostic biomarkers capable of identifying individuals with MCI and AD. Further, our data confirm what other groups have reported, that lipid metabolism is significantly perturbed in those individuals suffering with dementia. This work may provide additional insight into AD pathogenesis and encourage more in-depth analysis of the AD lipidome.", "Following the outbreak of what would become the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures were quickly introduced across East Asia-including drastic shelter-in-place orders in some cities-drawing on experience with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) almost two decades ago. \"Smart City\" technologies and other digital tools were quickly deployed for infection control purposes, ranging from conventional thermal scanning cameras to digital tracing in the surveillance of at-risk individuals. Chatbots endowed with artificial intelligence have also been deployed to shift part of healthcare provision away from hospitals and to support a number of programmes for self-management of chronic disease in the community. With the closure of schools and adults working from home, digital technologies have also sustained many aspects of both professional and social life at a pace and scale not considered to be practicable before the outbreak. This paper considers how these new experiences with digital technologies in public health surveillance are spurring digitalization in East Asian societies beyond the conventional public health context. It also considers some of the concerns and challenges that are likely to arise with rapid digitalization, particularly in healthcare.", "The last decade has seen a huge surge in interest surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). AI has been around since the 1950s, although technological limitations in the early days meant performance was initially inferior compared to humans.1 With rapid progression of algorithm design, growth of vast digital datasets and development of powerful computing power, AI now has the capability to outperform humans. Consequently, the integration of AI into the modern world is skyrocketing. This review article will give an overview of the use of AI in the modern world and discuss current and potential uses in healthcare, with a particular focus on its applications and likely impact in medical imaging. We will discuss the consequences and challenges of AI integration into healthcare.", "In flexible neuromorphic systems for realizing artificial intelligence, organic memristors are essential building blocks as artificial synapses to perform information processing and memory. Despite much effort to implement artificial neural networks (ANNs) using organic memristors, the reliability of these devices is inherently hampered by global ion transportation and arbitrary growth of conductive filaments (CFs). As a result, the performance of ANNs is restricted. Herein, a novel concept for confining CF growth in organic memristors is demonstrated by exploiting the unique functionality of crosslinkable polymers. This can be achieved by predefining the localized ion-migration path (LIP) in crosslinkable polymers. In the proposed organic memristor, metal cations are locally transported along the LIP. Thus, CF growth is achieved only in a confined region. A flexible memristor with an LIP exhibits a vastly improved reliability and uniformity, and it is capable of operating with high mechanical and electrical endurance. Moreover, neuromorphic arrays based on the proposed memristor exhibit 96.3% learning accuracy, which is comparable to the ideal software baseline. The proposed concept of predefining the LIP in organic memristors is expected to provide novel platforms for the advance of flexible electronics and to realize a variety of practical neural networks for artificial intelligence applications.", "Neurolaryngology as a subspecialty of laryngology has developed considerably in the last four decades with more laryngologists, neurologists, speech and swallow therapists, and neurophysiologists taking interest in the field. The North American and Japanese laryngology societies have increasingly focused on conditions which are mainly concerned with aberrations of the nervous system affecting the larynx directly or indirectly. In the last few years, societies in Europe and the Asia-Pacific have also recognized the need to collaborate both within their organizations and with other societies globally. Cross-border pollination of ideas has increasingly become easier and with the aid of technology - almost seamless with real-time capacity to share operating experience, lectures, and panel discussions. The future advances in neurolaryngology will require incremental improvements in processes of diagnostics, objectivization (where possible) of pathology, standardization of treatments with comparison of results using accepted patient-based tests, investigations and imaging where possible. Ultimately, from the contributions in the previous chapters, it is fairly obvious that many conditions are still poorly understood and therefore management becomes more symptom based rather than dealing with the root cause of the problem. An understanding of the physiology of vocalization, swallow, and breathing beyond a rudimentary acceptance of many towards the vagus nerve and other neural factors may help understand what has otherwise been a rather simplistic approach to one of the most complex parts of the human body, essential to life and equally important - the quality of life. In this chapter, we aim to look at where advances in neurolaryngology may and perhaps will take place. We will look at the potential of better imaging modalities, neurophysiological testing and physiology of the brain. Tests and treatments currently in use may require some refinements or be possibly abandoned and replaced with more effective ones that can demonstrate a difference in the management of various patient groups. The future is hard to predict, and the rate of advancement equally so, but given the rate at which information technology, artificial intelligence, and basic science research are progressing, neurolaryngology may indeed have its welcome boost in the not too distant future.", "The majority of naturally occurring proteins have evolved to function under mild conditions inside the living organisms. One of the critical obstacles for the use of proteins in biotechnological applications is their insufficient stability at elevated temperatures or in the presence of salts. Since experimental screening for stabilizing mutations is typically laborious and expensive, in silico predictors are often used for narrowing down the mutational landscape. The recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence further facilitate the development of such computational tools. However, the accuracy of these predictors strongly depends on the quality and amount of data used for training and testing, which have often been reported as the current bottleneck of the approach. To address this problem, we present a novel database of experimental thermostability data for single-point mutants FireProtDB. The database combines the published datasets, data extracted manually from the recent literature, and the data collected in our laboratory. Its user interface is designed to facilitate both types of the expected use: (i) the interactive explorations of individual entries on the level of a protein or mutation and (ii) the construction of highly customized and machine learning-friendly datasets using advanced searching and filtering. The database is freely available at https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/fireprotdb.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a major frontier in computer science research. Although AI has been available for some time and found its application in many fields of medicine, its use in dermatology is comparatively new and limited. A sound understanding of the concepts of AI is essential for dermatologists as skin conditions with their abundant clinical and dermatoscopic data and images can potentially be the next big thing in the application of AI in medicine. There are already a number of artificial intelligence studies focusing on skin disorders, such as skin cancer, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and onychomycosis. This article presents an overview of AI and new developments relevant to dermatology, examining both its current applications and future potential.", "Hereditary colorectal cancer (HCRC) syndromes account for 10% of colorectal cancers but remain underdiagnosed. This feasibility project tested the utility of an artificial intelligence-based chatbot deployed to patients scheduled for colonoscopy to identify HCRC risk factors, educate participants about HCRC and obtain consent to genetic testing as an extension of genetic counselling of appropriate subjects. Genetic counsellor (GC) and genetic counselling assistant (GCA) time spent per subject was also measured.\nPatients scheduled for colonoscopy at Cleveland Clinic were invited via electronic medical record patient portal or letter prior to colonoscopy with a link to a chatbot administering the Colon Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (CCRAT) to screen for HCRC syndromes. Those with \u22651 positive response to a CCRAT question received chatbot-deployed genetic education and the option to receive genetic testing. An order for a 55-gene pan-cancer panel was placed for those consenting, and the subject had blood drawn on the day of colonoscopy. Results were disclosed by a GC or GCA by telephone. Subject demographics, progression through the chat, responses to CCRAT, personal and family history, genetic test results and communication with the subject were recorded. Descriptive statistics and two-tailed unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test were used.\n506/4254 (11.9%) initiated and 487 (96.2%) completed the chat with the chatbot. 215 (44.1%) answered 'yes' to \u22651 CCRAT question and all completed pretest education. 129/181 (71.3%) subjects who consented completed testing, and 12 (9.3%) were found to have a germline pathogenic variant. Per subject, the GC spent a mean of 14.3 (SD 7.3) and the GCA a mean of 19.2 (SD 9.8) minutes.\nThe use of a chatbot in this setting was a novel and feasible method, with the potential of increasing genetic screening and testing in individuals at risk of HCRC syndromes.", "To identify and analyze various types of leadership and management that could contribute to the strengthening of health systems based on primary health care (PHC).\nA structured review of the literature on management and leadership applicable to PHC-based health systems was conducted. Of the 19 articles identified, relevant details were extracted using a standardized methodology.\nPHC-based health systems should establish optimal management practices to achieve quality, efficiency, and effectiveness. Strategic planning and management facilitate the development of a common identity, although some organizations are overmanaged and poorly led. Universal health is a strategic driver that requires transformational leadership to move toward PHC-based systems. Leadership in these systems must focus on identifying adaptive challenges, linking staff and protecting grassroots leadership, as well as adapting to the times and combining the logic of action of the strategist to achieve a sector transformation. The quality models establish leadership criteria similar to other theories, emphasizing innovation and organizational identity.\nLatin America must move towards health systems based on PHC, with leaders with emotional intelligence who discover their own transformative events, seek quality, and combine various types of leadership. They must be strategists to lead the system in its transition to resilient organizations, and \"alchemists\" to achieve true transformations in health, with the willingness and humility of those who work to achieve universal health.\nIdentificar y analizar varios tipos de liderazgo y de gesti\u00f3n que podr\u00edan aportar al fortalecimiento de los sistemas de salud basados en atenci\u00f3n primaria en salud (APS).\nSe realiz\u00f3 una revisi\u00f3n estructurada de literatura en gesti\u00f3n y liderazgo aplicable a los sistemas de salud basados en APS.

Children with LDs experience substantial working memory (WM) deficits, even more pronounced if more than one of the academic skills is affected. We compared the task-related electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectral density of children with LDs (n = 23) with a control group of children with good academic achievement (n = 22), during the performance of a WM task. sLoreta was used to estimate the current distribution at the sources, and 18 brain regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen with an extended version of the eigenvector centrality mapping technique. In this way, we lessened some drawbacks of the traditional EEG at the sensor space by an analysis at the brain-sources level over data-driven selected ROIs. Results: The LD group showed fewer correct responses in the WM task, an overall slower EEG with more delta and theta activity, and less high-frequency gamma activity in posterior areas. We explain these EEG patterns in LD children as indices of an inefficient neural resource management related with a delay in neural maturation.", "Rapid development of artificial intelligence techniques ignites the emerging demand on accurate perception and understanding of optical signals from external environments via brain-like visual systems. Here, enabled by quasi-two-dimensional electron gases (quasi-2DEGs) in InGaO3(ZnO)3 superlattice nanowires (NWs), an artificial visual system was built to mimic the human ones. This system is based on an unreported device concept combining coexistence of oxygen adsorption-desorption kinetics on NW surface and strong carrier quantum-confinement effects in superlattice core, to resemble the biological Ca2+ ion flux and neurotransmitter release dynamics. Given outstanding mobility and sensitivity of superlattice NWs, an ultralow energy consumption down to subfemtojoule per synaptic event is realized in quasi-2DEG synapses, which rivals that of biological synapses and now available synapse-inspired electronics. A flexible quasi-2DEG artificial visual system is demonstrated to simultaneously perform high-performance light detection, brain-like information processing, nonvolatile charge retention, in situ multibit-level memory, orientation selectivity, and image memorizing.", "Cognitive decline in older adults is a serious public health problem today. Association between vitamin D supplementation and cognition remains controversial.\nTo determine whether a 12-month vitamin D supplementation improves cognitive function in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and whether it is mediated through the mechanism in which telomere length (TL) regulate oxidative stress.\nThis was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Tianjin, China. Participants were all native Chinese speakers aged 65 years and older with MCI. 183 subjects were randomized to an intervention group (vitamin D 800 IU/day, n\u200a=\u200a93) or a placebo group (the matching starch granules, n\u200a=\u200a90), and followed up for 12 months. Tests of cognitive function and mechanism-related biomarkers were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.\nRepeated-measures ANOVA showed substantial improvements in the full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), information, digit span, vocabulary, block design, and picture arrangement scores in the vitamin D group over the placebo group (p\u200a<\u200a0.001). Leukocyte TL was significantly higher, while serum 8-OXO-dG, OGG1mRNA, and P16INK4amRNA revealed greater decreases in the vitamin D group over the placebo group (p\u200a<\u200a0.001). According to mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA analysis, vitamin D group showed a significant enhancement in the FSIQ score for 12 months compared with the control (estimate value\u200a=\u200a5.132, p\u200a<\u200a0.001).\nVitamin D supplementation for 12 months appears to improve cognitive function through reducing oxidative stress regulated by increased TL in order adults with MCI. Vitamin D may be a promising public health strategy to prevent cognitive decline.", "COVID-19 outbreak has become a global pandemic that affected more than 200 countries. Predicting the epidemiological behavior of this outbreak has a vital role to prevent its spreading. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM) network as a robust deep learning model is proposed to forecast the number of total confirmed cases, total recovered cases, and total deaths in Saudi Arabia. The model was trained using the official reported data. The optimal values of the model's parameters that maximize the forecasting accuracy were determined. The forecasting accuracy of the model was assessed using seven statistical assessment criteria, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), ef\ufb01ciency coef\ufb01cient (EC), overall index (OI), coefficient of variation (COV), and coef\ufb01cient of residual mass (CRM). A reasonable forecasting accuracy was obtained. The forecasting accuracy of the suggested model is compared with two other models. The first is a statistical based model called autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The second is an artificial intelligence based model called nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARANN). Finally, the proposed LSTM model was applied to forecast the total number of confirmed cases as well as deaths in six different countries; Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, and USA. These countries have different epidemic trends as they apply different polices and have different age structure, weather, and culture. The social distancing and protection measures applied in different countries are assumed to be maintained during the forecasting period. The obtained results may help policymakers to control the disease and to put strategic plans to organize Hajj and the closure periods of the schools and universities.", "Pressure on the US health care system has been increasing due to a combination of aging populations, rising health care expenditures, and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses to this pressure are hindered in part by reliance on a limited supply of highly trained health care professionals, creating a need for scalable technological solutions. Digital symptom checkers are artificial intelligence-supported software tools that use a conversational \"chatbot\" format to support rapid diagnosis and consistent triage. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new attention to these tools due to the need to avoid face-to-face contact and preserve urgent care capacity. However, evidence-based deployment of these chatbots requires an understanding of user demographics and associated triage recommendations generated by a large general population.\nIn this study, we evaluate the user demographics and levels of triage acuity provided by a symptom checker chatbot deployed in partnership with a large integrated health system in the United States.\nThis population-based descriptive study included all web-based symptom assessments completed on the website and patient portal of the Sutter Health system (24 hospitals in Northern California) from April 24, 2019, to February 1, 2020. User demographics were compared to relevant US Census population data.\nA total of 26,646 symptom assessments were completed during the study period. Most assessments (17,816/26,646, 66.9%) were completed by female users. The mean user age was 34.3 years (SD 14.4 years), compared to a median age of 37.3 years of the general population. The most common initial symptom was abdominal pain (2060/26,646, 7.7%). A substantial number of assessments (12,357/26,646, 46.4%) were completed outside of typical physician office hours. Most users were advised to seek medical care on the same day (7299/26,646, 27.4%) or within 2-3 days (6301/26,646, 23.6%). Over a quarter of the assessments indicated a high degree of urgency (7723/26,646, 29.0%).\nUsers of the symptom checker chatbot were broadly representative of our patient population, although they skewed toward younger and female users. The triage recommendations were comparable to those of nurse-staffed telephone triage lines. Although the emergence of COVID-19 has increased the interest in remote medical assessment tools, it is important to take an evidence-based approach to their deployment.", "Mammography plays an important role in screening breast cancer among females, and artificial intelligence has enabled the automated detection of diseases on medical images. This study aimed to develop a deep learning model detecting breast cancer in digital mammograms of various densities and to evaluate the model performance compared to previous studies. From 1501 subjects who underwent digital mammography between February 2007 and May 2015, craniocaudal and mediolateral view mammograms were included and concatenated for each breast, ultimately producing 3002 merged images. Two convolutional neural networks were trained to detect any malignant lesion on the merged images. The performances were tested using 301 merged images from 284 subjects and compared to a meta-analysis including 12 previous deep learning studies. The mean area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for detecting breast cancer in each merged mammogram was 0.952 \u00b1 0.005 by DenseNet-169 and 0.954 \u00b1 0.020 by EfficientNet-B5, respectively. The performance for malignancy detection decreased as breast density increased (density A, mean AUC = 0.984 vs. density D, mean AUC = 0.902 by DenseNet-169). When patients' age was used as a covariate for malignancy detection, the performance showed little change (mean AUC, 0.953 \u00b1 0.005). The mean sensitivity and specificity of the DenseNet-169 (87 and 88%, respectively) surpassed the mean values (81 and 82%, respectively) obtained in a meta-analysis. Deep learning would work efficiently in screening breast cancer in digital mammograms of various densities, which could be maximized in breasts with lower parenchyma density.", "A method for machine learning and serving of discrete field theories in physics is developed. The learning algorithm trains a discrete field theory from a set of observational data on a spacetime lattice, and the serving algorithm uses the learned discrete field theory to predict new observations of the field for new boundary and initial conditions. The approach of learning discrete field theories overcomes the difficulties associated with learning continuous theories by artificial intelligence. The serving algorithm of discrete field theories belongs to the family of structure-preserving geometric algorithms, which have been proven to be superior to the conventional algorithms based on discretization of differential equations. The effectiveness of the method and algorithms developed is demonstrated using the examples of nonlinear oscillations and the Kepler problem. In particular, the learning algorithm learns a discrete field theory from a set of data of planetary orbits similar to what Kepler inherited from Tycho Brahe in 1601, and the serving algorithm correctly predicts other planetary orbits, including parabolic and hyperbolic escaping orbits, of the solar system without learning or knowing Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation. The proposed algorithms are expected to be applicable when the effects of special relativity and general relativity are important.", "To combat COVID-19, curb the pandemic, and manage containment, governments around the world are turning to data collection and population monitoring for analysis and prediction. The massive data generated through the use of big data and artificial intelligence can play an important role in addressing this unprecedented global health and economic crisis.\nThe objective of this work is to develop an expert system that combines several solutions to combat COVID-19. The main solution is based on a new developed software called General Guide (GG) application. This expert system allows us to explore, monitor, forecast, and optimize the data collected in order to take an efficient decision to ensure the safety of citizens, forecast, and slow down the spread's rate of COVID-19. It will also facilitate countries' interventions and optimize resources. Moreover, other solutions can be integrated into this expert system, such as the automatic vehicle and passenger sanitizing system equipped with a thermal and smart High Definition (HD) cameras and multi-purpose drones which offer many services. All of these solutions will facilitate lifting COVID-19 restrictions and minimize the impact of this pandemic.\nThe methods used in this expert system will assist in designing and analyzing the model based on big data and artificial intelligence (machine learning). This can enhance countries' abilities and tools in monitoring, combating, and predicting the spread of COVID-19.\nThe results obtained by this prediction process and the use of the above mentioned solutions will help monitor, predict, generate indicators, and make operational decisions to stop the spread of COVID-19.\nThis developed expert system can assist in stopping the spread of COVID-19 globally and putting the world back to work.", "A large number of fibroblast foci (FF) predict mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Other prognostic histological markers have not been identified. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a possibility to quantitate possible prognostic histological features in IPF. We aimed to test the use of AI in IPF lung tissue samples by quantitating FF, interstitial mononuclear inflammation, and intra-alveolar macrophages with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Lung tissue samples of 71 patients with IPF from the FinnishIPF registry were analyzed by an AI model developed in the Aiforia\u00ae platform. The model was trained to detect tissue, air spaces, FF, interstitial mononuclear inflammation, and intra-alveolar macrophages with 20 samples. For survival analysis, cut-point values for high and low values of histological parameters were determined with maximally selected rank statistics. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. A large area of FF predicted poor prognosis in IPF (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). High numbers of interstitial mononuclear inflammatory cells and intra-alveolar macrophages were associated with prolonged survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, respectively). Of lung function values, low diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was connected to a high density of FF (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and a high forced vital capacity of predicted was associated with a high intra-alveolar macrophage density (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The deep CNN detected histological features that are difficult to quantitate manually. Interstitial mononuclear inflammation and intra-alveolar macrophages were novel prognostic histological biomarkers in IPF. Evaluating histological features with AI provides novel information on the prognostic estimation of IPF.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare delivery has become an important area of research due to the rapid progression of technology, which has allowed the growth of many processes historically reliant upon human input. AI has become particularly important in plastic surgery in a variety of settings. This article highlights current applications of AI in plastic surgery and discusses future implications. We further detail ethical issues that may arise in the implementation of AI in plastic surgery.\nWe conducted a systematic literature review of all electronically available publications in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases as of February 5, 2020. All returned publications regarding the application of AI in plastic surgery were considered for inclusion.\nOf the 89 novel articles returned, 14 satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles procured from the references of those of the database search and those pertaining to historical and ethical implications were summarized when relevant.\nNumerous applications of AI exist in plastic surgery. Big data, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and facial recognition are examples of AI-based technology that plastic surgeons may utilize to advance their surgical practice. Like any evolving technology, however, the use of AI in healthcare raises important ethical issues, including patient autonomy and informed consent, confidentiality, and appropriate data use. Such considerations are significant, as high ethical standards are key to appropriate and longstanding implementation of AI.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been proposed for reproductive medicine since 1997. Although AI is the main driver of emergent technologies in reproduction, such as robotics, Big Data, and internet of things, it will continue to be the engine for technological innovation for the foreseeable future. What does the future of AI research look like?", "The insertion of porous metal media inside the pipes and channels has already shown a significant heat transfer enhancement by experimental and numerical studies. Porous media could make a mixing flow and small-scale eddies. Therefore, the turbulence parameters are attractive in such cases. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach can predict the turbulence parameters using the turbulence models. However, the CFD is unable to find the relation of the turbulence parameters to the boundary conditions. The artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential in combination with the CFD to build high-performance predictive models. This study is aimed to establish a new AI algorithm to capture the patterns of the CFD results by changing the system's boundary conditions. The ant colony optimization-based fuzzy inference system (ACOFIS) method is used for the first time to reduce time and computational effort needed in the CFD simulation. This investigation is done on turbulent forced convection of water through an aluminum metal foam tube under constant wall heat flux. The ANSYS-FLUENT CFD software is used for the simulations. The x and y of the fluid nodal locations, inlet temperature, velocity, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) are the inputs of the ACOFIS to predict turbulence eddy dissipation (TED) as the output. The results revealed that for the best intelligence of the ACOFIS, the number of inputs, the number of ants, the number of membership functions (MFs) and the rule are 5, 10, 93 and 93, respectively. Further comparison is made with the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The coefficient of determination for both methods was close to 1. The ANFIS showed more learning and prediction times (785\u00a0s and 10\u00a0s, respectively) than the ACOFIS (556\u00a0s and 3\u00a0s, respectively). Finding the member function versus the inputs, the value of TED is calculated without the CFD modeling. So, solving the complicated equations by the CFD is replaced with a simple correlation.", "Prolonged seizures in children with focal epilepsy (FE) may impair language functions and often reoccur after surgical intervention. This study is aimed at developing a novel deep relational reasoning network to investigate whether conventional diffusion-weighted imaging connectome analysis can be improved when predicting expressive and receptive scores of preoperative language impairments and classifying postoperative seizure outcomes (seizure freedom or recurrence) in individual FE children. To deeply reason the dependencies of axonal connections that are sparsely distributed in the whole brain, this study proposes the \"dilated CNN + RN\", a dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a relation network (RN). The performance of the dilated CNN + RN was evaluated using whole brain connectome data from 51 FE children. It was found that when compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the dilated CNN + RN led to an average improvement of 90.2% and 97.3% in predicting expressive and receptive language scores, and 2.2% and 4% improvement in classifying seizure freedom and seizure recurrence, respectively. These improvements were independent of the prefixed connectome densities. Also, the dilated CNN + RN could provide an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) model by computing gradient-based regression/classification activation maps. This mapping analysis revealed left superior-medial frontal cortex, bilateral hippocampi, and cerebellum as crucial hubs, facilitating important connections that were most predictive of language function and seizure refractoriness after surgery.", "Recently, low-cost, high-quality graphene can be obtained readily, so it is potential to prepare conductive graphene modified asphalts (GMAs). In this paper, GMAs were prepared with 0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10% of graphene by weight of composites. Dynamic shear rheological experiments conducted from -30 to 120 \u00b0C illustrate that elasticity at above ambient temperatures and rutting resistance at higher temperatures are enhanced and, especially, the conceived percolation of GMAs occurs at graphene contents (GC) above 8% which were verified from three changes as GC increases, i.e., the curve characteristics of complex moduli, storage moduli at temperatures over 100 \u00b0C, temperatures when the phase angle reaches 90\u00b0 and the trend of TG'=G''. The modification mechanisms are different before and after percolation. Before the percolation threshold, graphene which has a molecular structure similar to asphaltene enhances asphalt, like increasing asphaltene components, and after threshold, graphene improves asphalt because of the formed graphene networks. Rotational viscosities test results show that the higher the GC is, the higher the operating temperatures are, but the operating temperatures are higher than 200 \u00b0C when GC is above 4%. The percolation helps to further develop conductive asphalt concrete for intelligence pavement, but the operating properties of GMAs need to be improved.", "Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a new socioeconomic revolution in which data and immediacy are the main ingredients. IoT generates large datasets on a daily basis but it is currently considered as \"dark data\", i.e., data generated but never analyzed. The efficient analysis of this data is mandatory to create intelligent applications for the next generation of IoT applications that benefits society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are very well suited to identifying hidden patterns and correlations in this data deluge. In particular, clustering algorithms are of the utmost importance for performing exploratory data analysis to identify a set (a.k.a., cluster) of similar objects. Clustering algorithms are computationally heavy workloads and require to be executed on high-performance computing clusters, especially to deal with large datasets. This execution on HPC infrastructures is an energy hungry procedure with additional issues, such as high-latency communications or privacy. Edge computing is a paradigm to enable light-weight computations at the edge of the network that has been proposed recently to solve these issues. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of emergent edge computing architectures that include low-power Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to speed-up these workloads. Our analysis includes performance and power consumption figures of the latest Nvidia's AGX Xavier to compare the energy-performance ratio of these low-cost platforms with a high-performance cloud-based counterpart version. Three different clustering algorithms (i.e., k-means, Fuzzy Minimals (FM), and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)) are designed to be optimally executed on edge and cloud platforms, showing a speed-up factor of up to 11\u00d7 for the GPU code compared to sequential counterpart versions in the edge platforms and energy savings of up to 150% between the edge computing and HPC platforms.", "The human brain is a sophisticated, high-performance biocomputer that processes multiple complex tasks in parallel with high efficiency and remarkably low power consumption. Scientists have long been pursuing an artificial intelligence (AI) that can rival the human brain. Spiking neural networks based on neuromorphic computing platforms simulate the architecture and information processing of the intelligent brain, providing new insights for building AIs. The rapid development of materials engineering, device physics, chip integration, and neuroscience has led to exciting progress in neuromorphic computing with the goal of overcoming the von Neumann bottleneck. Herein, fundamental knowledge related to the structures and working principles of neurons and synapses of the biological nervous system is reviewed. An overview is then provided on the development of neuromorphic hardware systems, from artificial synapses and neurons to spike-based neuromorphic computing platforms. It is hoped that this review will shed new light on the evolution of brain-like computing.", "Personalized medicine is among the most exciting innovations in recent clinical research, offering the opportunity for tailored screening and management at the individual level. Biomarker-enriched clinical trials have shown increased efficiency and informativeness in cancer research due to the selective exclusion of patients unlikely to benefit. In acute stress situations, clinically significant decisions are often made in time-sensitive manners and providers may be pressed to make decisions based on abbreviated clinical assessments. Up to 30% of trauma survivors admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) will develop long-lasting posttraumatic stress psychopathologies. The long-term impact of those survivors with posttraumatic stress sequelae are significant, impacting both long-term psychological and physiological recovery. An accurate prognostic model of who will develop posttraumatic stress symptoms does not exist yet. Additionally, no scalable and cost-effective method that can be easily integrated into routine care exists, even though especially the acute care setting provides a critical window of opportunity for prevention in the so-called golden hours when preventive measures are most effective. In this review, we aim to discuss emerging machine learning (ML) applications that are promising for precisely risk stratification and targeted treatments in the acute care setting. The aim of this narrative review is to present examples of digital health innovations and to discuss the potential of these new approaches for treatment selection and prevention of posttraumatic sequelae in the acute care setting. The application of artificial intelligence-based solutions have already had great success in other areas and are rapidly approaching the field of psychological care as well. New ways of algorithm-based risk predicting, and the use of digital phenotypes provide a high potential for predicting future risk of PTSD in acute care settings and to go new steps in precision psychiatry.", "Medication Guides consisting of crucial interactions and side effects are extensive and complex. Due to the exhaustive information, patients do not retain the necessary medication information, which can result in hospitalizations and medication nonadherence. A gap exists in understanding patients' cognition of managing complex medication information. However, advancements in technology and artificial intelligence (AI) allow us to understand patient cognitive processes to design an app to better provide important medication information to patients.\nOur objective is to improve the design of an innovative AI- and human factor-based interface that supports patients' medication information comprehension that could potentially improve medication adherence.\nThis study has three aims. Aim 1 has three phases: (1) an observational study to understand patient perception of fear and biases regarding medication information, (2) an eye-tracking study to understand the attention locus for medication information, and (3) a psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm study to understand functionalities. Observational data will be collected, such as audio and video recordings, gaze mapping, and time from PRP. A total of 50 patients, aged 18-65 years, who started at least one new medication, for which we developed visualization information, and who have a cognitive status of 34 during cognitive screening using the TICS-M test and health literacy level will be included in this aim of the study. In Aim 2, we will iteratively design and evaluate an AI-powered medication information visualization interface as a smartphone app with the knowledge gained from each component of Aim 1. The interface will be assessed through two usability surveys. A total of 300 patients, aged 18-65 years, with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or mental health disorders, will be recruited for the surveys. Data from the surveys will be analyzed through exploratory factor analysis. In Aim 3, in order to test the prototype, there will be a two-arm study design. This aim will include 900 patients, aged 18-65 years, with internet access, without any cognitive impairment, and with at least two medications. Patients will be sequentially randomized. Three surveys will be used to assess the primary outcome of medication information comprehension and the secondary outcome of medication adherence at 12 weeks.\nPreliminary data collection will be conducted in 2021, and results are expected to be published in 2022.\nThis study will lead the future of AI-based, innovative, digital interface design and aid in improving medication comprehension, which may improve medication adherence. The results from this study will also open up future research opportunities in understanding how patients manage complex medication information and will inform the format and design for innovative, AI-powered digital interfaces for Medication Guides.\nPRR1-10.2196/21659.", "An association between the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the presence of certain chronic conditions has been suggested. However, unlike influenza and other viruses, the disease burden of COVID-19 in patients with asthma has been less evident.\nTo understand the impact of COVID-19 in patients with asthma.\nUsing big-data analytics and artificial intelligence through the SAVANA Manager clinical platform, we analysed clinical data from patients with asthma from January 1 to May 10, 2020.\nOut of 71\u200a182 patients with asthma, 1006 (1.41%) suffered from COVID-19. Compared to asthmatic individuals without COVID-19, patients with asthma and COVID-19 were significantly older (55 versus 42\u2005years), predominantly female (66% versus 59%), smoked more frequently and had higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidaemias, diabetes and obesity. Allergy-related factors such as rhinitis and eczema were less common in asthmatic patients with COVID-19 (p<0.001). In addition, higher prevalence of these comorbidities was observed in patients with COVID-19 who required hospital admission. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was lower in patients who required hospitalisation due to COVID-19, as compared to non-hospitalised patients (48.3% versus 61.5%; OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.77). Although patients treated with biologics (n=865; 1.21%) showed increased severity and more comorbidities at the ear, nose and throat level, COVID-19-related hospitalisations in these patients were relatively low (0.23%).\nPatients with asthma and COVID-19 were older and at increased risk due to comorbidity-related factors. ICS and biologics are generally safe and may be associated with a protective effect against severe COVID-19 infection.", "Artificial intelligence (AI), known by some as the industrial revolution (IR) 4.0, is going to change not only the way we do things, how we relate to others, but also what we know about ourselves. This article will first examine what AI is, discuss its impact on industrial, social, and economic changes on humankind in the 21st century, and then propose a set of principles for AI bioethics. The IR1.0, the IR of the 18th century, impelled a huge social change without directly complicating human relationships. Modern AI, however, has a tremendous impact on how we do things and also the ways we relate to one another. Facing this challenge, new principles of AI bioethics must be considered and developed to provide guidelines for the AI technology to observe so that the world will be benefited by the progress of this new intelligence.", "Despite tremendous gains from deep learning and the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine to improve diagnosis and save costs, there exists a large translational gap to implement and use AI products in real-world clinical situations. Adoption of standards such as Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging is increasing to improve the peer-review process and reporting of AI tools. However, no such standards exist for product-level review.\nA review of clinical trials showed a paucity of evidence for radiology AI products; thus, the authors developed a 10-question assessment tool for reviewing AI products with an emphasis on their validation and result dissemination. The assessment tool was applied to commercial and open-source algorithms used for diagnosis to extract evidence on the clinical utility of the tools.\nThere is limited technical information on methodologies for FDA-approved algorithms compared with open-source products, likely because of intellectual property concerns. Furthermore, FDA-approved products use much smaller data sets compared with open-source AI tools, because the terms of use of public data sets are limited to academic and noncommercial entities, which precludes their use in commercial products.\nOverall, this study reveals a broad spectrum of maturity and clinical use of AI products, but a large gap exists in exploring actual performance of AI tools in clinical practice.", "Objective To explore self-compassion and its role in supporting well-being, compassionate care, and the academic experience in undergraduate nursing students. Method Whittemore and Knafl's (2005) integrative review methodology was used to search articles published between 2007 and 2020, which resulted in 36 articles meeting the inclusion criteria: compassion for self and others, strategies to support self-compassion; and self-compassion and student learning. Result Findings indicate that self-compassion may promote compassionate care, personal well-being, resilience, and emotional intelligence while supporting indicators of academic success. Compassion literacy, mindfulness training, and experiential exercises are some of the strategies that could be integrated into nursing curricula to enhance compassion in nursing students for self and others. Conclusion Integrating mindfulness and self-compassion in undergraduate curricula requires innovative teaching and learning approaches within a supportive organizational environment. To this end, a Self-Compassion Curricular Model to guide nursing programs is proposed.", "Image analysis is one of the most promising applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care, potentially improving prediction, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. Although scientific advances in this area critically depend on the accessibility of large-volume and high-quality data, sharing data between institutions faces various ethical and legal constraints as well as organizational and technical obstacles.\nThe Joint Imaging Platform (JIP) of the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) addresses these issues by providing federated data analysis technology in a secure and compliant way. Using the JIP, medical image data remain in the originator institutions, but analysis and AI algorithms are shared and jointly used. Common standards and interfaces to local systems ensure permanent data sovereignty of participating institutions.\nThe JIP is established in the radiology and nuclear medicine departments of 10 university hospitals in Germany (DKTK partner sites). In multiple complementary use cases, we show that the platform fulfills all relevant requirements to serve as a foundation for multicenter medical imaging trials and research on large cohorts, including the harmonization and integration of data, interactive analysis, automatic analysis, federated machine learning, and extensibility and maintenance processes, which are elementary for the sustainability of such a platform.\nThe results demonstrate the feasibility of using the JIP as a federated data analytics platform in heterogeneous clinical information technology and software landscapes, solving an important bottleneck for the application of AI to large-scale clinical imaging data.", "Game-based learning supported by mobile intelligence technology has promoted the renewal of teaching and learning models. Herein, a model of Question-Observation-Doing-Explanation (QODE) based on smart phones was constructed and applied to science learning during school disruption in COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, from the theoretical perspective of cognitive-affective theory of learning with media, Bandura's motivation theory and community of inquiry model, self-report measure was used to verify the effect of students' scientific self-efficacy and cognitive anxiety on science engagement. A total of 357 valid questionnaires were used for structural equation model research. The results indicated that two types of scientific self-efficacy, as indicated by scientific learning ability and scientific learning behavior, were negatively associated with cognitive anxiety. In addition, cognitive anxiety was also negatively correlated to four types of science engagement, as indicated by cognitive engagement, emotional engagement, behavioral engagement, and social engagement through smartphone interactions. These findings provide further evidence for game-based learning promoted by smart phones, contributing to a deeper understanding of the associations between scientific self-efficacy, cognitive anxiety, and science engagement. This study points out that the QODE model is suitable for implementing smart mobile devices to students' science learning.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated promise in predicting acute kidney injury (AKI), however, clinical adoption of these models requires interpretability and transportability. Non-interoperable data across hospitals is a major barrier to model transportability. Here, we leverage the US PCORnet platform to develop an AKI prediction model and assess its transportability across six independent health systems. Our work demonstrates that cross-site performance deterioration is likely and reveals heterogeneity of risk factors across populations to be the cause. Therefore, no matter how accurate an AI model is trained at the source hospital, whether it can be adopted at target hospitals is an unanswered question. To fill the research gap, we derive a method to predict the transportability of AI models which can accelerate the adaptation process of external AI models in hospitals.", "Preliminary research in youth with chronic pain suggests differences in attention and working memory, which has been similarly demonstrated in adults with chronic pain. There has been little research on other aspects of executive functioning (EF) in this population despite its critical role in problem solving, school functioning, and coping. This study aimed to examine differences in several aspects of EF between youth with chronic pain and a nonchronic pain comparison group using performance-based neuropsychological tests and a behavior rating scale.\nParticipants completed ratings of pain; physical, emotional, social, and school functioning; sleep quality; medication; and a general intelligence screener. Standardized neuropsychological tests were used to examine EF with a focus on working memory, divided and alternating attention, inhibition, flexibility, incidental memory, and planning. A parent-report and self-report behavior rating of EF was also administered.\nRecruitment from 2 tertiary-care pain clinics resulted in a sample of 26 youth with chronic pain (80.8% girls) and their parents. A comparison group of 30 youth without chronic pain and their parents were recruited from the community. Participants with chronic pain had significantly lower scores on several performance-based tests of working memory/divided attention, inhibition, and flexibility/alternating attention than the comparison group. Statistically significant group differences were also found on behavior ratings of emotion control, shifting, task initiation and completion, working memory, planning and organization, overall emotion and cognitive regulation as well as global EF. Covariate analysis was conducted in all analyses where there were significant group differences and several observed group differences remained.\nThis study is one of few multidimensional examinations of EF in youth with chronic pain, using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery combined with behavior ratings. Our findings suggest EF differences in youth with chronic pain, across a variety of domains and may suggest risk for specific cognitive processing weaknesses in this population. Medical and educational teams should work toward identification, treatment, and compensatory support for EF within individualized pain management for youth.", "To assess the attitude about the importance of introducing education on artificial intelligence (AI) in medical schools' curricula among physicians whose everyday job is significantly impacted by AI.\nAn anonymous questionnaire was distributed at the national level in Croatia among radiologists and radiology residents practicing in primary, secondary, and tertiary health care institutions, both in the private and the public sectors. The overall response rate was 45% (144 of 321).\nA large majority of participants - 89.6% (95% Agresti-Coull confidence interval 0.83-0.94) agreed on the need for education on AI to be included in medical curricula. Answers revealed a very high support across age groups and regardless of subspecialty area. A slightly higher support was present among physicians working in university hospitals compared with those in primary care centers, and among radiology residents compared with radiologists - but these estimated differences are uncertain, and the support levels were clearly high across the considered variables.\nSince medical students have previously been shown to support introducing education on AI, a growing literature argues the same for reasons here reviewed, and physicians practicing a highly relevant area (radiology) overwhelmingly agree, we conclude that medical schools should indeed take steps to keep pace with technological progress in medicine by including education on AI in their curricula, be it as part of existing or new courses.", "A challenge of group-living is to maintain cohesion while navigating through heterogeneous landscapes. Larger groups benefit from information pooling, translating to greater 'collective intelligence', but face increased coordination challenges. If these facets interact, we should observe a non-linear relationship between group size and collective movement. We deployed high-resolution GPS tags to vulturine guineafowl from 21 distinct social groups and used continuous-time movement models to characterize group movements across five seasons. Our data revealed a quadratic relationship between group size and movement characteristics, with intermediate-sized groups exhibiting the largest home-range size and greater variation in space use. Intermediate-sized groups also had higher reproductive success, but having more young in the group reduced home-range size. Our study suggests the presence of an optimal group size, and composition, for collective movement.\nMany social animals live in stable groups that stay together for years, or even lifetimes. Being in a group offers a range of benefits, such as safety from predators, information on where to find food or water, and more accurate navigation. But these benefits come at a cost. The larger the group, the harder it is to make decisions that balance the needs of each individual. So, while members of a large group should be better at locating resources and finding their way, they may take longer to decide where to go next. In nature, groups of the same species can vary greatly in size and can have large or small numbers of offspring. This raises the question of whether there is an optimal group size where the benefits of living together are maximized relative to the costs? To help answer this question, Papageorgiou and Farine studied the group behaviour of vulturine guineafowl, a social, ground-dwelling bird found in the savannahs of East Africa. A lightweight GPS tracker was fitted to the members of 21 different groups of vulturine guineafowl to see how group size affects the movement of these birds. The tags collected data every five minutes from dawn until dusk each day, and remained active over five two-month spans of similar weather conditions. This revealed that groups of intermediate size, which contain 33 to 37 birds, ranged over larger areas allowing them to access more diverse resources, and used less energy by travelling shorter distances. Birds in these groups also explored more new areas, decreasing their chances of encountering a predator, and produced more chicks, suggesting that their collective behaviour gave them a reproductive advantage. These findings suggest that intermediate sized groups display an optimal level of movement compared to larger or smaller groups. Understanding how social groups of different sizes interact with their environment can aid conservation planning. Future work should focus on how this relationship changes with the seasons. This could reveal more about the effects of group size during challenging conditions, like drought.", "Traditionally, new treatments have been developed for the population at large. Recently, large-scale genomic sequencing analyses have revealed tremendous genetic diversity between individuals. In diseases driven by genetic events such as cancer, genomic sequencing can unravel all the mutations that drive individual tumors. The ability to capture the genetic makeup of individual patients has led to the concept of precision medicine, a modern, technology-driven form of personalized medicine. Precision medicine matches each individual to the best treatment in a way that is tailored to his or her genetic uniqueness. To further personalize medicine, precision medicine increasingly incorporates and integrates data beyond genomics, such as epigenomics and metabolomics, as well as imaging. Increasingly, the robust use and integration of these modalities in precision medicine require the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This modern view of precision medicine, adopted early in certain areas of medicine such as cancer, has started to impact the field of reproductive medicine. Here we review the concepts and history of precision medicine and artificial intelligence, highlight their growing impact on reproductive medicine, and outline some of the challenges and limitations that these new fields have encountered in medicine.", "In recent years, personalized gene regulatory networks have received significant attention, and interpretation of the multilayer networks has been a critical issue for a comprehensive understanding of gene regulatory systems. Although several statistical and machine learning approaches have been developed and applied to reveal sample-specific regulatory pathways, integrative understanding of the massive multilayer networks remains a challenge. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI) strategy for comprehensive gene regulatory network analysis. In our strategy, personalized gene networks corresponding specific clinical characteristic are constructed and the constructed network is considered as a second-order tensor. Then, an explainable AI method based on deep learning is applied to decompose the multilayer networks, thus we can reveal all-encompassing gene regulatory systems characterized by clinical features of patients. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we apply our method to the multilayer gene networks under varying conditions of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. From the comprehensive analysis of multilayer networks, we identified novel markers, and the biological mechanisms of the identified genes and their reciprocal mechanisms are verified through the literature. Although any biological knowledge about the identified genes was not incorporated in our analysis, our data-driven approach based on AI approach provides biologically reliable results. Furthermore, the results provide crucial evidences to reveal biological mechanism related to various diseases, e.g., keratinocyte proliferation. The use of explainable AI method based on the tensor decomposition enables us to reveal global and novel mechanisms of gene regulatory system from the massive multiple networks, which cannot be demonstrated by existing methods. We expect that the proposed method provides a new insight into network biology and it will be a useful tool to integrative gene network analysis related complex architectures of diseases.", "The phenotypic correlation between human intelligence and brain volume (BV) is considerable (r\u2009\u2248\u20090.40), and has been shown to be due to shared genetic factors. To further examine specific genetic factors driving this correlation, we present genomic analyses of the genetic overlap between intelligence and BV using genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. First, we conduct a large BV GWAS meta-analysis (N\u2009=\u200947,316 individuals), followed by functional annotation and gene-mapping. We identify 18 genomic loci (14 not previously associated), implicating 343 genes (270 not previously associated) and 18 biological pathways for BV. Second, we use an existing GWAS for intelligence (N\u2009=\u2009269,867 individuals), and estimate the genetic correlation (rg) between BV and intelligence to be 0.24. We show that the rg is partly attributable to physical overlap of GWAS hits in 5 genomic loci. We identify 92 shared genes between BV and intelligence, which are mainly involved in signaling pathways regulating cell growth. Out of these 92, we prioritize 32 that are most likely to have functional impact. These results provide information on the genetics of BV and provide biological insight into BV's shared genetic etiology with intelligence.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is a strong predictor of negative mood. Applying emotional skills correctly can help to increase positive emotional states and reduce negative ones. This study aims to implement EI intervention designed to improve clarity, repair EI dimensions and coping strategies, and reduce negative mood in older adults.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group.\nParticipants were evaluated individually before and after the intervention.\nParticipants included 111 healthy older adults; 51 in the treatment group and 60 in the control group.\nAn EI program was implemented. The program was administered over 10 sessions lasting 90 min each.\nEI dimension (attention, clarity, and repair), coping strategies, hopelessness, and mood were assessed.\nAnalysis of variance for repeated measures was applied. In the treatment group, scores on clarity and emotional repair increased and attention to emotions decreased; problem-focused coping (problem-solving, positive reappraisal, and seeking social support) showed significant increases, whereas emotion-focused coping (negative self-focused and overt emotional expression) obtained significant decreases; scores on negative mood measures declined significantly.\nAn intervention based on EI is effective in older adults. After the EI intervention, the participants showed significant increases in their levels of clarity and emotional repair and intermediate levels of attention. In addition, the intervention was found to influence adaptation results, increasing the use of adaptive coping strategies and decreasing the use of maladaptive strategies, as well as reducing hopelessness and depressive symptoms.", "Artificially intelligent computer systems are used extensively in medical sciences. Common applications include diagnosing patients, end-to-end drug discovery and development, improving communication between physician and patient, transcribing medical documents, such as prescriptions, and remotely treating patients. While computer systems often execute tasks more efficiently than humans, more recently, state-of-the-art computer algorithms have achieved accuracies which are at par with human experts in the field of medical sciences. Some speculate that it is only a matter of time before humans are completely replaced in certain roles within the medical sciences. The motivation of this article is to discuss the ways in which artificial intelligence is changing the landscape of medical science and to separate hype from reality.", "Multiplayer games have long been used as testbeds in artificial intelligence research, aptly referred to as the Drosophila of artificial intelligence. Traditionally, researchers have focused on using well-known games to build strong agents. This progress, however, can be better informed by characterizing games and their topological landscape. Tackling this latter question can facilitate understanding of agents and help determine what game an agent should target next as part of its training. Here, we show how network measures applied to response graphs of large-scale games enable the creation of a landscape of games, quantifying relationships between games of varying sizes and characteristics. We illustrate our findings in domains ranging from canonical games to complex empirical games capturing the performance of trained agents pitted against one another. Our results culminate in a demonstration leveraging this information to generate new and interesting games, including mixtures of empirical games synthesized from real world games.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can result in deterioration of cardiac function, which is associated with high mortality. A simple point-of-care diagnostic test to screen for ventricular dysfunction would be clinically useful to guide management. We sought to review the clinical experience with an artificial intelligence electrocardiogram (AI ECG) to screen for ventricular dysfunction in patients with documented COVID-19. We examined all patients in the Mayo Clinic system who underwent clinically indicated electrocardiography and echocardiography within 2 weeks following a positive COVID-19 test and had permitted use of their data for research were included. Of the 27 patients who met the inclusion criteria, one had a history of normal ventricular function who developed COVID-19 myocarditis with rapid clinical decline. The initial AI ECG in this patient indicated normal ventricular function. Repeat AI ECG showed a probability of ejection fraction (EF) less than or equal to 40% of 90.2%, corroborated with an echocardiographic EF of 35%. One other patient had a pre-existing EF less than or equal to 40%, accurately detected by the algorithm before and after COVID-19 diagnosis, and another was found to have a low EF by AI ECG and echocardiography with the COVID-19 diagnosis. The area under the curve for detection of EF less than or equal to 40% was 0.95. This case series suggests that the AI ECG, previously shown to detect ventricular dysfunction in a large general population, may be useful as a screening tool for the detection of cardiac dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.", "To measure the IQ and record dermatoglyphic patterns of children including intellectually disabled aged between 5 years and 11 years and to correlate them.\nThe present study was a cross-sectional study conducted in two private schools in the city corporation limits. A total of 300 children aged between 5 years and 11 years were equally allocated into three groups based on IQ using covariate adaptive randomization. IQ of the children was measured using Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices. Bilateral palmar and finger prints were obtained on A4-size papers by ink method using rolling technique. Prints thus obtained were analyzed for dermatoglyphic variables using magnification lens and are read based on Cummins and Midlo classification for fingertip patterns and Bali and Chaube classification for palmar flexion creases. The data were entered and statistically analyzed. For statistical significance, a two-tailed probability value of less than 0.05 was taken as significant.\nThe current study suggests a relationship between different fingertip patterns of digits of I, II, III, and IV of left and right hand and also digit V of right hand with various levels of IQ.\nHence, dermatoglyphics can be considered as a preliminary noninvasive approach for the determination of IQ. Also, it plays an imperative role, especially in distinguishing genetic intellectual disabilities.\nTharay N, Nirmala SVSG, Bavikati VN, et a l.

We examined the accuracy of AI ECG for identification of LVSD (defined as LVEF \u226440% by transthoracic echocardiogram [TTE]) in cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) patients.\nWe included unique Mayo Clinic CICU patients admitted from 2007 to 2018 who underwent AI-ECG and TTE within 7\u00a0days, at least one of which was during hospitalization. Discrimination of the AI-ECG for LVSD was determined using receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) values.\nWe included 5680 patients with a mean age of 68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0years (37% females). Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was present in 55%. LVSD was present in 34% of patients (mean LVEF 48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016%). The AI-ECG had an AUC of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.82-0.84) for discrimination of LVSD. Using the optimal cut-off, the AI-ECG had 73%, specificity 78%, negative predictive value 85% and overall accuracy 76% for LVSD. AUC values were higher for patients aged <70\u00a0years (0.85 versus 0.80), males (0.84 versus 0.79), patients without ACS (0.86 versus 0.80), and patients who did not undergo revascularization (0.84 versus 0.80).\nThe AI-ECG algorithm had very good discrimination for LVSD in this critically-ill CICU cohort with a high prevalence of LVSD. Performance was better in younger male patients and those without ACS, highlighting those CICU patients in whom screening for LVSD using AI ECG may be more effective. The AI-ECG might potentially be useful for identification of LVSD in resource-limited settings when TTE is unavailable.", "Central to the study of cognition is being able to specify the Subject that is making decisions and owning memories and preferences. However, all real cognitive agents are made of parts (such as brains made of cells). The integration of many active subunits into a coherent Self appearing at a larger scale of organization is one of the fundamental questions of evolutionary cognitive science. Typical biological model systems, whether basal or advanced, have a static anatomical structure which obscures important aspects of the mind-body relationship. Recent advances in bioengineering now make it possible to assemble, disassemble, and recombine biological structures at the cell, organ, and whole organism levels. Regenerative biology and controlled chimerism reveal that studies of cognition in intact, \"standard\", evolved animal bodies are just a narrow slice of a much bigger and as-yet largely unexplored reality: the incredible plasticity of dynamic morphogenesis of biological forms that house and support diverse types of cognition. The ability to produce living organisms in novel configurations makes clear that traditional concepts, such as body, organism, genetic lineage, death, and memory are not as well-defined as commonly thought, and need considerable revision to account for the possible spectrum of living entities. Here, I review fascinating examples of experimental biology illustrating that the boundaries demarcating somatic and cognitive Selves are fluid, providing an opportunity to sharpen inquiries about how evolution exploits physical forces for multi-scale cognition. Developmental (pre-neural) bioelectricity contributes a novel perspective on how the dynamic control of growth and form of the body evolved into sophisticated cognitive capabilities. Most importantly, the development of functional biobots - synthetic living machines with behavioral capacity - provides a roadmap for greatly expanding our understanding of the origin and capacities of cognition in all of its possible material implementations, especially those that emerge de novo, with no lengthy evolutionary history of matching behavioral programs to bodyplan. Viewing fundamental questions through the lens of new, constructed living forms will have diverse impacts, not only in basic evolutionary biology and cognitive science, but also in regenerative medicine of the brain and in artificial intelligence.", "For more than a decade, we have witnessed an acceleration in the development and the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. In medicine, it impacts clinical and fundamental research, hospital practices, medical examinations, hospital care or logistics. These in turn contribute to improvements in diagnostics and prognostics, and to improvements in personalised and targeted medicine, advanced observation and analysis technologies, or surgery and other assistance robots. Many challenges in AI and medicine, such as data digitalisation, medical data privacy, algorithm explicability, inclusive AI system development or their reproducibility, have to be tackled in order to build the confidence of medical practitioners in these technologies.

In this exploratory observational cohort study, we determined feasibility of automated AI extraction of baseline impedance (AIBI) and evaluated clinical value of novel AI metrics.\npH-impedance data from a convenience sample of symptomatic patients studied off (n\u2009=\u2009117, 53.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u00a0years, 66% F) and on (n\u2009=\u200993, 53.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u00a0years, 74% F) anti-secretory therapy and from asymptomatic volunteers (n\u2009=\u2009115, 29.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00a0years, 47% F) were uploaded into dedicated prototypical AI software designed to automatically extract AIBI. Acid exposure time (AET) and manually extracted mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI) were compared to corresponding total, upright, and recumbent AIBI and upright:recumbent AIBI ratio. AI metrics were compared to AET and MNBI in predicting \u2009\u2265\u200950% symptom improvement in GERD patients.\nRecumbent, but not upright AIBI, correlated with MNBI. Upright:recumbent AIBI ratio was higher when AET \u2009>\u20096% (median 1.18, IQR 1.0-1.5), compared to \u2009<\u20094% (0.95, IQR 0.84-1.1), 4-6% (0.89, IQR 0.72-0.98), and controls (0.93, IQR 0.80-1.09, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.04). While MNBI, total AIBI, and the AIBI ratio off PPI were significantly different between those with and without symptom improvement (p\u2009<\u20090.05 for each comparison), only AIBI ratio segregated management responders from other cohorts. On ROC analysis, off therapy AIBI ratio outperformed AET in predicting GERD symptom improvement when AET was \u2009>\u20096% (AUC 0.766 vs. 0.606) and 4-6% (AUC 0.563 vs. 0.516) and outperformed MNBI overall (AUC 0.661 vs. 0.313).\nBI calculation can be automated using AI.

This is also true in the field of reproductive medicine, where we are witnessing exciting applications of digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). It is anticipated that AI-guided approaches will become more objective, more accurate, and more rapid, resulting in greater precision, standardization, and automatization in our field.

Unidentifiable retinal images were obtained, one centered on the disc and one on the fovea. The exams were classified with the autonomous AI system and manually by anonymous ophthalmologists. The results of the AI system and manual classification were compared in terms of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of both (RDR) and diabetic retinopathy with decreased vision (VTDR).\n10,257 retinal inages of 5,630 eyes of 2,680 subjects were included. According to the manual classification, the prevalence of RDR was 4.14% and that of VTDR 2.57%. The AI system recorded 100% (95% CI: 97-100%) sensitivity and 81.82% (95% CI: 80 -83%) specificity for RDR, and 100% (95% CI: 95-100%) of sensitivity and 94.64% (95% CI: 94-95%) of specificity for VTDR.\nCompared to the manual classification, the autonomous diagnostic AI system registered a high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (82%) in the diagnosis of RDR and macular edema in people with diabetes. Due to its immediate diagnosis, the autonomous diagnostic AI system can increase the accessibility of RDR screening in primary care settings.", "Interpretation of the significance of maternally inherited X chromosome variants in males with neurocognitive phenotypes continues to present a challenge to clinical geneticists and diagnostic laboratories. Here we report 14 males from 9 families with duplications at the Xq13.2-q13.3 locus with a common facial phenotype, intellectual disability (ID), distinctive behavioral features, and a seizure disorder in two cases. All tested carrier mothers had normal intelligence. The duplication arose de novo in three mothers where grandparental testing was possible. In one family the duplication segregated with ID across three generations. RLIM is the only gene common to our duplications. However, flanking genes duplicated in some but not all the affected individuals included the brain-expressed genes NEXMIF, SLC16A2, and the long non-coding RNA gene FTX. The contribution of the RLIM-flanking genes to the phenotypes of individuals with different size duplications has not been fully resolved. Missense variants in RLIM have recently been identified to cause X-linked ID in males, with heterozygous females typically having normal intelligence and highly skewed X chromosome inactivation. We detected consistent and significant increase of RLIM mRNA and protein levels in cells derived from seven affected males from five families with the duplication. Subsequent analysis of MDM2, one of the targets of the RLIM E3 ligase activity, showed consistent downregulation in cells from the affected males. All the carrier mothers displayed normal RLIM mRNA levels and had highly skewed X chromosome inactivation. We propose that duplications at Xq13.2-13.3 including RLIM cause a recognizable but mild neurocognitive phenotype in hemizygous males.", "The diffusion of electronic health records collecting large amount of clinical, monitoring, and laboratory data produced by intensive care units (ICUs) is the natural terrain for the application of artificial intelligence (AI). AI has a broad definition, encompassing computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning, with the latter being more commonly employed in the ICUs. Machine learning may be divided in supervised learning models (i.e., support vector machine [SVM] and random forest), unsupervised models (i.e., neural networks [NN]), and reinforcement learning. Supervised models require labeled data that is data mapped by human judgment against predefined categories. Unsupervised models, on the contrary, can be used to obtain reliable predictions even without labeled data. Machine learning models have been used in ICU to predict pathologies such as acute kidney injury, detect symptoms, including delirium, and propose therapeutic actions (vasopressors and fluids in sepsis). In the future, AI will be increasingly used in ICU, due to the increasing quality and quantity of available data. Accordingly, the ICU team will benefit from models with high accuracy that will be used for both research purposes and clinical practice. These models will be also the foundation of future decision support system (DSS), which will help the ICU team to visualize and analyze huge amounts of information. We plea for the creation of a standardization of a core group of data between different electronic health record systems, using a common dictionary for data labeling, which could greatly simplify sharing and merging of data from different centers.", "Artificial intelligence powered by deep neural networks has reached a level of complexity where it can be difficult or impossible to express how a model makes its decisions. This black-box problem is especially concerning when the model makes decisions with consequences for human well-being. In response, an emerging field called explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to increase the interpretability, fairness, and transparency of machine learning. In this paper, we describe how cognitive psychologists can make contributions to XAI. The human mind is also a black box, and cognitive psychologists have over 150 years of experience modeling it through experimentation. We ought to translate the methods and rigor of cognitive psychology to the study of artificial black boxes in the service of explainability. We provide a review of XAI for psychologists, arguing that current methods possess a blind spot that can be complemented by the experimental cognitive tradition. We also provide a framework for research in XAI, highlight exemplary cases of experimentation within XAI inspired by psychological science, and provide a tutorial on experimenting with machines. We end by noting the advantages of an experimental approach and invite other psychologists to conduct research in this exciting new field.", "Over 60 % of people over the age of 65 will suffer from multiple diseases concomitantly but the common approach is to treat each disease separately. As age-associated diseases have common underlying mechanisms there is potential to tackle many diseases with the same pharmacological intervention. These are known as geroprotectors and could overcome the problems related to polypharmacy seen with the use of the single disease model. With some geroprotectors now reaching the end stage of preclinical studies and early clinical trials, there is a need to review the evidence and assess how they can be translated practically and effectively into routine practice. Despite promising evidence, there are many gaps and challenges in our understanding that must be addressed to make geroprotective medicine effective in the treatment of age-associated multimorbidity. Here we highlight the key barriers to clinical translation and discuss whether geroprotectors such as metformin, rapamycin and senolytics can tackle all age-associated diseases at the same dose, or whether a more nuanced approach is required. The evidence suggests that geroprotectors' mode of action may differ in different tissues or in response to different inducers of accelerating ageing, suggesting that a blunt 'one drug for many diseases' approach may not work. We make the case for the use of artificial intelligence to better understand multimorbidity, allowing identification of clusters and networks of diseases that are significantly associated beyond chance and the underpinning molecular pathway of ageing causal to each cluster. This will allow us to better understand the development of multimorbidity, select a more homogenous group of patients for intervention, match them with the appropriate geroprotector and identify biomarkers specific to the cluster.", "Within the field of cosmetic dermatology, several promising developments utilize artificial intelligence to better patient care. While many new treatments in cosmetic dermatology feature components of artificial intelligence, there is a knowledge gap within the field regarding the current and developing products featuring AI. We aim to highlight current and developing applications of artificial intelligence in cosmetic dermatology and provide insight into future modalities in this field. Methods include literature review, including peer-reviewed journal articles as well as product websites. In an age of medical and technological advancement, the utility of artificial intelligence models continues to grow.There are many new facets of artificial intelligence in cosmetic dermatology, marketed to both the consumer and the physician. With the development of customizable skin care, augmented reality applications, and at-home skin analysis tools, patients are empowered to be the masters of their cosmetic care. Artificial intelligence is utilized by physicians in new ways in their practices, with the advent of models for prediction of clinical outcome to treatments and tools for in-depth analysis of the patient's skin. Further research is required in the development of automated energy-based treatment devices and robotic-assisted treatments. Models for AI in cosmetic dermatology serve to increase patient involvement in their skin care decisions and have the ability to enhance the patient-physician experience. Dermatologists should be well-informed of the emerging technologies to better educate patients and enhance their clinical practice.", "Toward the successful development of artificial intelligence, artificial synapses based on resistive switching devices are essential ingredients to perform information processing in spiking neural networks. In neural processes, synaptic plasticity related to the history of neuron activity plays a critical role during learning. In resistive switching devices, it is barely possible to emulate both short-term plasticity and long-term plasticity due to the uncontrollable dynamics of the conductive filaments (CFs). Despite extensive effort to realize synaptic plasticity in such devices, it is still challenging to achieve reliable synaptic functions due to the overgrowth of CFs in a random fashion. Herein, we propose an organic resistive switching device with bio-realistic synaptic functions by adjusting the CF diffusive parameter. In the proposed device, complete synaptic plasticity provides the history-dependent change in the conductance. Moreover, the homeostatic feedback, which resembles the biological process, regulates CF growth in our device, which enhances the reliability of synaptic plasticity. This novel concept for realizing synaptic functions in organic resistive switching devices may provide a physical platform to advance the fundamental understanding of learning and memory mechanisms and develop a variety of neural circuits and neuromorphic systems that can be linked to artificial intelligence and next-generation computing paradigm.", "The purpose of this study was to understand the emotional intelligence level (EI) and negative emotional status of the front-line nurses in the epidemic situation and to further explore the relationship between them.\nDuring the COVID-19 epidemic, under the influence of multiple factors, nurses were vulnerable to negative emotions. While previous studies have explored, the role of emotional intelligence in negative emotions, the relationship between the two has not been sufficiently discussed in the context of COVID-19.\nThe study carried out a cross-sectional survey. The STROBE was selected as the checklist in this study.\n202 nurses from Wuhan makeshift hospital participated in the questionnaire survey. Data collection tools included a general data questionnaire designed by the researchers, Chinese version of EI scale (WLEIS-C) and Chinese version of Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Descriptive statistics, single factor analysis and correlation analysis were used to analyse the data.\nThe emotional intelligence of the front-line nurses was in the upper middle range. Among the negative emotions, anxiety was the most prominent symptom.\nManagers should pay attention to the negative emotional problems of front-line nurses, improve their EI level and promote mental health and the progress of epidemic prevention.\nImproving the level of emotional intelligence can reduce the frequency and intensity of negative emotions. In clinical work, emotional intelligence can be used as a skill to carry out relevant training, which is conducive to playing a positive role in future emergencies.", "Background: Nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer is diagnosed, treated, and monitored using cystoscopy. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to augment tumor detection, but its performance is hindered by the limited availability of cystoscopic images required to form a large training data set. This study aimed to determine whether stepwise transfer learning with general images followed by gastroscopic images can improve the accuracy of bladder tumor detection on cystoscopic imaging. Materials and Methods: We trained a convolutional neural network with 1.2 million general images, followed by 8728 gastroscopic images. In the final step of the transfer learning process, the model was additionally trained with 2102 cystoscopic images of normal bladder tissue and bladder tumors collected at the University of Tsukuba Hospital. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve. The diagnostic performance of the models trained with cystoscopic images with or without stepwise organic transfer learning was compared with that of medical students and urologists with varying levels of experience. Results: The model developed by stepwise organic transfer learning had 95.4% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity. This performance was better than that of the other models and comparable with that of expert urologists. Notably, it showed superior diagnostic accuracy when tumors occupied >10% of the image. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the value of stepwise organic transfer learning in applications with limited data sets for training and further confirm the value of AI in medical diagnostics. Here, we applied deep learning to develop a tool to detect bladder tumors with an accuracy comparable with that of a urologist. To address the limitation that few bladder tumor images are available to train the model, we demonstrate that pretraining with general and gastroscopic images yields superior results.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) based on deep learning has shown excellent diagnostic performance in detecting various diseases with good-quality clinical images. Recently, AI diagnostic systems developed from ultra-widefield fundus (UWF) images have become popular standard-of-care tools in screening for ocular fundus diseases. However, in real-world settings, these systems must base their diagnoses on images with uncontrolled quality (\"passive feeding\"), leading to uncertainty about their performance. Here, using 40,562 UWF images, we develop a deep learning-based image filtering system (DLIFS) for detecting and filtering out poor-quality images in an automated fashion such that only good-quality images are transferred to the subsequent AI diagnostic system (\"selective eating\"). In three independent datasets from different clinical institutions, the DLIFS performed well with sensitivities of 96.9%, 95.6% and 96.6%, and specificities of 96.6%, 97.9% and 98.8%, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the application of our DLIFS significantly improves the performance of established AI diagnostic systems in real-world settings. Our work demonstrates that \"selective eating\" of real-world data is necessary and needs to be considered in the development of image-based AI systems.", "Burn injuries are one of the most severe forms of wounds and trauma across the globe. Automated burn diagnosis methods are needed to provide timely treatment to the concerned patients. Artificial intelligence is playing a vital role in developing automated tools and techniques for medical problems. However, the use of advanced AI techniques for color images based burn region segmentation is not much explored.\nIn this work, we explore the use of deep learning for the challenging problem of burn region segmentation. We prepared a pixel-wise labelled new burn images dataset for segmentation and investigated the efficacy of existing state-of-the-art color images based semantic image segmentation techniques. Lately, we proposed a new convolution neural network (CNN) that uses atrous convolution for encoding rich contextual information and utilizes pre-trained model ResNet-101 for better extraction of low-level and middle-level layer features.\nThe proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the prepared burn image dataset with 77.6% of Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) and 93.4% of accuracy. The improvement of 11.6/5.8/6.9/1.2% is observed in precision, Dice similarity coefficient, Jaccard index and specificity, in comparison to the second best performance.\nIn this work, we propose a CNN based novel method for performing burn-region segmentation in color images and evaluate it using newly prepared Burn Images dataset. The experimental results illustrate its effectiveness in comparison to existing approaches. Further, the proposed pixel-level segmentation method could be useful in estimating the burn surface area and burn severity in an accurate and time efficient manner.", "Older individuals encounter the greatest racial/gender biases. It is unknown whether younger generations, who often lead culture shifts, have racial and gender biases against older populations.\nUsing Amazon's Mechanical Turk's crowdsourcing, we identified how an individual's race and gender are associated with perceptions of individuals aged mid-60s. Participants were asked to rate photograph appearances on Likert Scale (1-10). Interactions between participant and photograph race and gender were assessed with mixed effects models. Delta represents rating differences (positive value higher rating for Whites or women, negative value higher rating for African-Americans or men).\nAmong 1563 participants (mean 35\u00a0years\u2009\u00b1\u200912), both non-Hispanic White (WP) and all Other race/ethnicity (OP) participants perceived African-American photos as more trustworthy [Delta WP -0.60(95%CI-0.83, -\u20090.37); Delta OP -\u20090.51(-\u20090.74,-0.28), interaction p\u2009=\u20090.06], more attractive [Delta non-Hispanic White participants -\u20090.63(-\u20090.97, -\u20090.29); Delta Other race/ethnicity participants -\u20090.40 (-\u20090.74, -\u20090.28), interaction p\u2009<\u20090.001], healthier [Delta WP -0.31(-\u20090.53, -\u20090.08); Delta OP -0.24(-\u20090.45, -0.03), interaction p\u2009=\u20091.00], and less threatening than White photos [Delta WP 0.79(0.36,1.22); Delta OP 0.60(0.17,1.03), interaction p\u2009<\u20090.001]. Compared with OP, WP perceived African-American photos more favorably for intelligence (interaction p\u2009<\u20090.001). Both genders perceived photos of women as more trustworthy [Delta Women\u00a0Participants (WmP) 0.50(0.27,0.73); Delta Men Participants(MnP) 0.31(0.08,0.54); interaction p\u2009<\u20090.001] and men as more threatening [Delta WmP -0.84(-1.27, -0.41), Delta MnP -\u20090.77(-\u20091.20, -\u20090.34), interaction p\u2009=\u20090.93]. Compared with MnP, WmP perceived photos of women as happier and more attractive than men (interaction p\u2009<\u20090.001). Compared with WmP, MnP perceived men as healthier than women (interaction p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nAmong a young generation, older African-Americans were perceived more favorably than Whites. Gender perceptions followed gender norms. This suggests a decline in implicit bias against older minorities, but gender biases persist. Future work should investigate whether similar patterns are observed in healthcare.", "Cancer is the manifestation of abnormalities of different physiological processes involving genes, DNAs, RNAs, proteins, and other biomolecules whose profiles are reflected in different omics data types. As these bio-entities are very much correlated, integrative analysis of different types of omics data, multi-omics data, is required to understanding the disease from the tumorigenesis to the disease progression. Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning algorithms, has the ability to make decisive interpretation of \"big\"-sized complex data and, hence, appears as the most effective tool for the analysis and understanding of multi-omics data for patient-specific observations. In this review, we have discussed about the recent outcomes of employing AI in multi-omics data analysis of different types of cancer. Based on the research trends and significance in patient treatment, we have primarily focused on the AI-based analysis for determining cancer subtypes, disease prognosis, and therapeutic targets. We have also discussed about AI analysis of some non-canonical types of omics data as they have the capability of playing the determiner role in cancer patient care. Additionally, we have briefly discussed about the data repositories because of their pivotal role in multi-omics data storing, processing, and analysis.", "Objective: To investigate the feasibility and clinical significance of a continuous auscultation recorder of bowel sounds based on artificial intelligence in monitoring the bowel sounds. Methods: From November 1,2018 to August 12,2019, a continuous auscultation recorder of bowel sounds was applied to monitor the perioperative bowel sounds of 31 patients undergoing colorectal surgery, in order to discovery underlying rules which might be used to guide clinical practice. Results: After the operation, the bowel sounds continued to exist for (1.8\u00b10.8) h, and then gradually weakened or disappeared, and recovered gradually after (11.2\u00b13.5) h. The first exhaust and the first defecation were detected at the time of (22.7\u00b15.8) h and (28.7\u00b16.9) h after surgery, respectively. The bowel sounds rate increased after eating, and decreased significantly after exhaust/defecation. Conclusions: The continuous auscultation recorder of bowel sounds based on artificial intelligence was safe and effective, which can afford help to clinical evaluation.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u80a0\u9e23\u97f3\u542c\u8bca\u8bb0\u5f55\u4eea\u5728\u76d1\u6d4b\u80a0\u9e23\u97f3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a 2018\u5e7411\u67081\u65e5\u81f32019\u5e748\u670812\u65e5\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u80a0\u9e23\u97f3\u542c\u8bca\u8bb0\u5f55\u4eea\u5bf9\u5728\u5357\u4eac\u4e2d\u533b\u836f\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u5c5e\u533b\u9662\u666e\u5916\u79d1\u5c31\u533b31\u4f8b\u63a5\u53d7\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u624b\u672f\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u5b9e\u65bd\u56f4\u624b\u672f\u671f\u80a0\u9e23\u97f3\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u6478\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u4e34\u5e8a\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \u624b\u672f\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\uff0c\u80a0\u9e23\u97f3\u4ecd\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff081.8\u00b10.8\uff09h\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5f31\u6216\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\uff0811.2\u00b13.5\uff09h\u540e\u9010\u6e10\u6062\u590d\u3002\u9996\u6b21\u6392\u6c14\u5728\u672f\u540e\uff0822.7\u00b15.8\uff09h\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u6392\u4fbf\u5728\u672f\u540e\uff0828.7\u00b16.9\uff09h\uff0c\u8fdb\u98df\u540e\u80a0\u7387\u5448\u4e0a\u5347\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u6392\u6c14/\u6392\u4fbf\u540e\uff0c\u80a0\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u660e\u663e\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a \u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u80a0\u9e23\u97f3\u542c\u8bca\u8bb0\u5f55\u4eea\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002.", "Development of biofluid-based biomarkers is attractive for the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but still lacking. Thus, here we aimed to identify serum metabolic biomarkers for the diagnosis of COPD.\nIn this study, we investigated serum metabolic features between COPD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a054) and normal individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a074) using a 1 H NMR-based metabolomics approach and developed an integrated method of least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) and serum metabolic biomarkers to assist COPD diagnosis.\nWe observed a hypometabolic state in serum of COPD patients, as indicated by decreases in N-acetyl-glycoprotein (NAG), lipoprotein (LOP, mainly LDL/VLDL), polyunsaturated fatty acid (pUFA), glucose, alanine, leucine, histidine, valine, and lactate. Using an integrated method of multivariable and univariate analyses, NAG and LOP were identified as two important metabolites for distinguishing between COPD patients and controls. Subsequently, we developed a LS-SVM classifier using these two markers and found that LS-SVM classifiers with linear and polynomial kernels performed better than the classifier with RBF kernel. Linear and polynomial LS-SVM classifiers can achieve the total accuracy rates of 80.77% and 84.62% and the AUC values of 0.87 and 0.90 for COPD diagnosis, respectively.\nThis study suggests that artificial intelligence integrated with serum metabolic biomarkers has a great potential for auxiliary diagnosis of COPD.", "The ability to plan for future events is one of the defining features of human intelligence. Whether non-human animals can plan for specific future situations remains contentious: despite a sustained research effort over the last two decades, there is still no consensus on this question. Here, we show that New Caledonian crows can use tools to plan for specific future events. Crows learned a temporal sequence where they were (a) shown a baited apparatus, (b) 5 min later given a choice of five objects and (c) 10 min later given access to the apparatus. At test, these crows were presented with one of two tool-apparatus combinations. For each combination, the crows chose the right tool for the right future task, while ignoring previously useful tools and a low-value food item. This study establishes that planning for specific future tool use can evolve via convergent evolution, given that corvids and humans shared a common ancestor over 300 million years ago, and offers a route to mapping the planning capacities of animals.", "This publication revises the deteriorated performance of field calibrated low-cost sensor systems after spatial and temporal relocation, which is often reported for air quality monitoring devices that use machine learning models as part of their software to compensate for cross-sensitivities or interferences with environmental parameters. The cause of this relocation problem and its relationship to the chosen algorithm is elucidated using published experimental data in combination with techniques from data science. Thus, the origin is traced back to insufficient sampling of data that is used for calibration followed by the incorporation of bias into models. Biases often stem from non-representative data and are a common problem in machine learning, and more generally in artificial intelligence, and as such a rising concern. Finally, bias is believed to be partly reducible in this specific application by using balanced data sets generated in well-controlled laboratory experiments, although not trivial due to the need for infrastructure and professional competence.", "The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of radiation dose to different intracranial structures on changes in intellectual function for children with brain tumors.\nWe evaluated children with brain tumors treated in 2005-2017 who had longitudinal neuropsychological assessments and available photon dosimetric data (if radiation therapy [RT] given). Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) and index scores were evaluated (perceptual reasoning index [PRI], processing speed index [PSI], verbal comprehension index [VCI], and working memory index [WMI]). Multivariable linear mixed effects models were used to model endpoints, with age at RT and dose to different brain regions as fixed effects and patient-specific random intercepts. P-values (P*) were adjusted for multiple comparisons.\nSixty-nine patients were included, 56 of whom received RT. Median neuropsychological follow-up was 3.2 years. Right temporal lobe mean dose was strongly associated with decline in FSIQ (P*\u2005=\u20050.005); with each gray increase in mean dose, there was a decrease of 0.052 FSIQ points per year. Dose to 50% (D50) of the supratentorial brain was associated with decline in PSI (P*\u2005=\u20050.006) and WMI (P*\u2005=\u20050.001). Right and left hippocampus D50 were individually strongly associated with declines in VCI (P*\u2005=\u20050.009 for each). Presence of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt decreased FSIQ by 10 points.\nWe reported associations between dosimetry to specific brain regions and intellectual outcomes, with suggested avoidance structures during RT planning. These models can help clinicians anticipate changes in neurocognition post-RT and guide selection of an optimal RT plan.", "The cross-sectional study is aimed at investigating the relationship between cortisol, testosterone, and metabolic characteristics among male schizophrenics.\n174 patients were grouped based on their risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) into the non-MetS, high-risk-MetS (HR-MetS), or MetS groups. Metabolic indices (body mass index (BMI), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cholesterol, triglyceride, and fasting blood glucose (FBG)) were associated with cortisol and testosterone levels using correlation analysis. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to associate the correlations between the WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) score and the five metabolic indices.\nThe WHOQOL-BREF score for the non-MetS group significantly differed from the scores of the HR-MetS and MetS groups. The triglyceride level was positively correlated with the cortisol level, while all five metabolic indices were negatively correlated with testosterone level. Stepwise regression analysis produced a model predicting WHOQOL-BREF scores with four variables including MAP, intelligence quotient (IQ), FBG, and age. The correlation analysis then showed that there was a weak linear correlation between the testosterone level and all five metabolic indices.\nAmong the five metabolic indices, the risks of hypertension and hyperglycemia are correlated with the quality of life in male schizophrenics rather than those of obesity or hyperlipidemia.", "In the past decade, there has been tremendous interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the field of radiology. Currently, numerous AI applications are in development, with potential benefits spanning all steps of the imaging chain from test ordering to report communication. AI has been proposed as a means to optimize patient scheduling, improve worklist management, enhance image acquisition, and help radiologists interpret diagnostic studies. Although the potential for AI in radiology appears almost endless, the field is still in the early stages, with many uses still theoretical, in development, or limited to single institutions. Moreover, although the current use of AI in radiology has emphasized its clinical applications, some of which are in the distant future, it is increasingly clear that AI algorithms could also be used in the more immediate future for a variety of noninterpretive and quality improvement uses. Such uses include the integration of AI into electronic health record systems to reduce unwarranted variation in radiologists' follow-up recommendations and to improve other dimensions of radiology report quality. In the end, the potential of AI in radiology must be balanced with acknowledgment of its current limitations regarding generalizability and data privacy.", "Bone surface modifications are foundational to the correct identification of hominin butchery traces in the archaeological record. Until present, no analytical technique existed that could provide objectivity, high accuracy, and an estimate of probability in the identification of multiple structurally-similar and dissimilar marks. Here, we present a major methodological breakthrough that incorporates these three elements using Artificial Intelligence (AI) through computer vision techniques, based on convolutional neural networks. This method, when applied to controlled experimental marks on bones, yielded the highest rate documented to date of accurate classification (92%) of cut, tooth and trampling marks. After testing this method experimentally, it was applied to published images of some important traces purportedly indicating a very ancient hominin presence in Africa, America and Europe. The preliminary results are supportive of interpretations of ancient butchery in some places, but not in others, and suggest that new analyses of these controversial marks should be done following the protocol described here to confirm or disprove these archaeological interpretations.", "Increasing demand for digital evidence in criminal investigations is driving decentralization of forensic capabilities closer to the crime scene. Law enforcement agencies are struggling to keep pace with technological developments, cybercrime growth, and scientific advances. In federated environments, digital forensic knowledge and practices vary widely across regions. To reduce delays, wasted resources, missed opportunities, mistakes, and misinterpretations, there is a pressing need to balance the democratization of digital forensic capabilities with knowledge management and sharing between decentralized regions. There are multiple forms of knowledge to be managed, including procedural, technical, investigative, scientific, behavioral, crime analysis, and forensic intelligence. In addition, there are multiple knowledge producers and consumers, including police investigators, digital forensic practitioners, criminal intelligence analysts, attorneys, and judges. Knowledge management becomes even more challenging when multiple interdependent regions are involved, speaking different languages. Taking all of these factors into consideration, this work presents an inter-regional knowledge management solution for improving the quality, consistency, reliability, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and return on investment of digital forensic capabilities. The basis of this work is a community-driven initiative of Swiss regional police authorities. Interviews were conducted with 15 digital forensic units to determine their current knowledge management practices and needs. The results were then generalized into a prioritized set of requirements for inter-regional digital forensic knowledge management that may be applicable in other countries. These requirements were used to evaluate knowledge management platforms, and one was selected. Implementation, operations, and maintenance challenges of an inter-regional digital forensic knowledge management platform are discussed.", "With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, it comes in a big wave carrying possibly huge impact in the field of medicine. Gastroenterology and hepatology, being a specialty relying much on diagnostic imaging, endoscopy, and histopathology, AI technology has promised improving the quality and consistency of care to the patients. In this review, we will elucidate the development of machine learning methods, especially the visual representation mechanism in deep learning on recognition tasks. Various AI-image analysis applications in endoscopy, radiology, and pathology are covered in gastroenterology and hepatology and reveal the enormous potentials for AI in assisting diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. We also discuss the promises as well as pitfalls for AI in medical image analysis and pointing out future research directions.", "The relatively high rate of injuries in construction is not surprising, as site work by its very nature ranks highly on fundamental risk factors. Working at heights often magnifies these risk factors. The literature reveals that falls from heights accounts for a large percentage of injuries in construction worldwide. Thailand is no exception, where fall accidents constitute the majority of high-rise construction accidents despite preventive measures being implemented. This paper examines how the use of a simple Ambient Intelligence (AmI) system-a device comprising a microcontroller, microwave sensors, Light Emitting Diode (LED) and audio alarm-could help to affect safety behavioural change of on-site construction workers in order to decrease the potential for fall accidents. An experiment was conducted at a high-rise building construction site in Bangkok, Thailand to examine the effectiveness of the AmI in helping workers mitigate the risk of falling from heights. The analysis of the data collected over two work weeks from the pre- and post-AmI application using X-bar charts and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant reduction of about 78% in the number of workers passing through the fall hazard zones. The finding established the potential of a simple AmI for reducing the risk of fall accidents.", "Despite remarkable progress in artificial intelligence, autonomous humanoid robots are still far from matching human-level manipulation and locomotion proficiency in real applications. Proficient robots would be ideal first responders to dangerous scenarios such as natural or man-made disasters. When handling these situations, robots must be capable of navigating highly unstructured terrain and dexterously interacting with objects designed for human workers. To create humanoid machines with human-level motor skills, in this work, we use whole-body teleoperation to leverage human control intelligence to command the locomotion of a bipedal robot. The challenge of this strategy lies in properly mapping human body motion to the machine while simultaneously informing the operator how closely the robot is reproducing the movement. Therefore, we propose a solution for this bilateral feedback policy to control a bipedal robot to take steps, jump, and walk in synchrony with a human operator. Such dynamic synchronization was achieved by (i) scaling the core components of human locomotion data to robot proportions in real time and (ii) applying feedback forces to the operator that are proportional to the relative velocity between human and robot. Human motion was sped up to match a faster robot, or drag was generated to synchronize the operator with a slower robot. Here, we focused on the frontal plane dynamics and stabilized the robot in the sagittal plane using an external gantry. These results represent a fundamental solution to seamlessly combine human innate motor control proficiency with the physical endurance and strength of humanoid robots.", "The study of adverse childhood experiences and their consequences has emerged over the past 20 years. Although the conclusions from these studies are available, the same is not true of the data. Accordingly, it is a complex problem to build a training set and develop machine-learning models from these studies. Classic machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques cannot provide a full scientific understanding of the inner workings of the underlying models. This raises credibility issues due to the lack of transparency and generalizability. Explainable artificial intelligence is an emerging approach for promoting credibility, accountability, and trust in mission-critical areas such as medicine by combining machine-learning approaches with explanatory techniques that explicitly show what the decision criteria are and why (or how) they have been established. Hence, thinking about how machine learning could benefit from knowledge graphs that combine \"common sense\" knowledge as well as semantic reasoning and causality models is a potential solution to this problem.\nIn this study, we aimed to leverage explainable artificial intelligence, and propose a proof-of-concept prototype for a knowledge-driven evidence-based recommendation system to improve mental health surveillance.\nWe used concepts from an ontology that we have developed to build and train a question-answering agent using the Google DialogFlow engine. In addition to the question-answering agent, the initial prototype includes knowledge graph generation and recommendation components that leverage third-party graph technology.\nTo showcase the framework functionalities, we here present a prototype design and demonstrate the main features through four use case scenarios motivated by an initiative currently implemented at a children's hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Ongoing development of the prototype requires implementing an optimization algorithm of the recommendations, incorporating a privacy layer through a personal health library, and conducting a clinical trial to assess both usability and usefulness of the implementation.\nThis semantic-driven explainable artificial intelligence prototype can enhance health care practitioners' ability to provide explanations for the decisions they make.", "Both researchers and practitioners often rely on direct observation to measure and monitor behavior. When these behaviors are too complex or numerous to be measured in vivo, relying on direct observation using human observers increases the amount of resources required to conduct research and to monitor the effects of interventions in practice. To address this issue, we conducted a proof of concept examining whether artificial intelligence could measure vocal stereotypy in individuals with autism. More specifically, we used an artificial neural network with over 1,500\u2009minutes of audio data from 8 different individuals to train and test models to measure vocal stereotypy. Our results showed that the artificial neural network performed adequately (i.e., session-by-session correlation near or above .80 with a human observer) in measuring engagement in vocal stereotypy for 6 of 8 participants. Additional research is needed to further improve the generalizability of the approach.", "Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are aiding in improving sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging. The rapid adoption of these advanced ML algorithms is transforming imaging analysis; taking us from noninvasive detection of pathology to noninvasive precise diagnosis of the pathology by identifying whether detected abnormality is a secondary to infection, inflammation and/or neoplasm. This is led to the emergence of \"Radiobiogenomics\"; referring to the concept of identifying biologic (genomic, proteomic) alterations in the detected lesion. Radiobiogenomic involves image segmentation, feature extraction, and ML model to predict underlying tumor genotype and clinical outcomes. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer related death worldwide. There are several histologic subtypes of lung cancer, e.g., small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma). These variable histologic subtypes not only appear different at microscopic level, but these also differ at genetic and transcription level. This intrinsic heterogeneity reveals itself as different morphologic appearances on diagnostic imaging, such as CT, PET/CT and MRI. Traditional evaluation of imaging findings of lung cancer is limited to morphologic characteristics, such as lesion size, margins, density. Radiomics takes image analysis a step further by looking at imaging phenotype with higher order statistics in efforts to quantify intralesional heterogeneity. This heterogeneity, in turn, can be potentially used to extract intralesional genomic and proteomic data. This review aims to highlight novel concepts in ML and AI and their potential applications in identifying radiobiogenomics of lung cancer.", "Automated medical report generation in spine radiology, i.e., given spinal medical images and directly create radiologist-level diagnosis reports to support clinical decision making, is a novel yet fundamental study in the domain of artificial intelligence in healthcare. However, it is incredibly challenging because it is an extremely complicated task that involves visual perception and high-level reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose the neural-symbolic learning (NSL) framework that performs human-like learning by unifying deep neural learning and symbolic logical reasoning for the spinal medical report generation. Generally speaking, the NSL framework firstly employs deep neural learning to imitate human visual perception for detecting abnormalities of target spinal structures. Concretely, we design an adversarial graph network that interpolates a symbolic graph reasoning module into a generative adversarial network through embedding prior domain knowledge, achieving semantic segmentation of spinal structures with high complexity and variability. NSL secondly conducts human-like symbolic logical reasoning that realizes unsupervised causal effect analysis of detected entities of abnormalities through meta-interpretive learning. NSL finally fills these discoveries of target diseases into a unified template, successfully achieving a comprehensive medical report generation. When employed in a real-world clinical dataset, a series of empirical studies demonstrate its capacity on spinal medical report generation and show that our algorithm remarkably exceeds existing methods in the detection of spinal structures. These indicate its potential as a clinical tool that contributes to computer-aided diagnosis.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) consists of setting different technics together aimed at allowing machines to simulate human cognitive fonctions, mimic human brain functions, sometime its logic, when it comes to answer to an interrogation, to take decisions or to anticipate events. This new fonction, after being used in numerous daily life domains (geo-guides, personal assistants, administratif procedures) comes now in the medical area. The press exaggerations on those systems doesn't have any wise and thoughtful judgment. This article will talk about the question of the real uses and expertise capacities which the AI should be able to provide in our area. Through the history of cognitive science and ideas, the recension of important works on the AI developments, we want to put in perspective the promises and opportunities provided to modify or complete the expertise in orthodontics. The willingness to extend cognitive and action abilities is older than what the comma historiography of the AI let us think. The recent development of computer systems, algorithmic science and databases allowed the development of a branch of the artificial intelligent giving, in some cases, seemingly undeniable results which should not be extrapolated because of the weakness of our databases, the current economic model and their real use.", "The concept of GP clusters is derived from 'quality circles' in general practice in Europe and Canada. GP clusters commenced across Scotland in 2016 to improve the quality of care of local populations.\nTo determine GPs' views on clusters, and the robustness of bespoke questions about them.\nA cross-sectional national survey of work satisfaction of GPs in Scotland took place, which was conducted in July 2018-October 2018.\nAn analysis of bespoke questions on GP clusters was undertaken. The questions were completed by quality leads (QLs) and all other GPs in a nationally representative sample of GPs.\nIn total, 2456 responses were received from 4371 GPs (56.4%). QLs reported that clusters were meeting regularly, and were friendly and well organised but not always productive. Support for cluster activity (data, health intelligence, analysis, quality improvement methods, advice, leadership, and evaluation) was suboptimal. Factor analysis identified two separate constructs (cluster meetings [CMs] and cluster support [CS]), which were minimally influenced (<2%) by GP and practice characteristics. Non-QLs (75% of all GPs) were generally satisfied with the two-way communication with the cluster QLs, but the great majority (>70%) reported no positive changes in various aspects of quality improvement. Factor analysis of these items indicated two constructs (cluster knowledge and engagement [CKE] and cluster quality improvement [CQI]), which were minimally affected by GP and practice characteristics.\nGP clusters are 'up and running' in Scotland but are at an early stage in terms of perceived impact and appear to be in need of more support in order to improve quality of care. The bespoke questions developed on clusters have robust construct validity, suitable for future surveys.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) is understanding one's own feeling and able to handle those feelings without disturbing themselves. Medical schools are stressful and the ability to manage stress is a major factor of success for these students. The current study contributes further insight to body of research in EI as it relates to students' stress in education, especially among dental undergraduates of Delhi.\nA cross-sectional, convenient sampling-based survey was conducted among 323 dental undergraduates from all the 3 dental Institutions across Delhi. The Schutte Emotional Intelligence and Perceived Stress scale instruments were administered to all the students of four professional years. The data analysis was done using SPSS V.17 and various statistical tests were used to determine significant difference.\nNo significant differences were found among gender as well as among professional groups for EI. There was a significant difference (0.008) among gender with respect to perceived stress. Correlation analysis showed an inverse relationship between EI and PS (r = -0.227) which was found to be statistically significant.\nTraining in dental education could be quite stressful due to their time-bound work, but regular student performance assessment and associated factors would allow understanding student behavior in handling situations.\nYadav V, Mohanty V, Balappanavar AY, et al.

There are different computational drug-repurposing strategies and some of these approaches have been applied to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Computational drug-repositioning approaches applied to COVID-19 can be broadly categorized into (i) network-based models, (ii) structure-based approaches and (iii) artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. Network-based approaches are divided into two categories: network-based clustering approaches and network-based propagation approaches. Both of them allowed to annotate some important patterns, to identify proteins that are functionally associated with COVID-19 and to discover novel drug-disease or drug-target relationships useful for new therapies. Structure-based approaches allowed to identify small chemical compounds able to bind macromolecular targets to evaluate how a chemical compound can interact with the biological counterpart, trying to find new applications for existing drugs. AI-based networks appear, at the moment, less relevant since they need more data for their application.", "Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have contributed to advances in Occupational Health and Safety, improving the security of workers. The use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) based on ICTs reduces the risk of accidents in the workplace, thanks to the capacity of the equipment to make decisions on the basis of environmental factors. Paradigms such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) make it possible to generate PPE models feasibly and create devices with more advanced characteristics such as monitoring, sensing the environment and risk detection between others. The working environment is monitored continuously by these models and they notify the employees and their supervisors of any anomalies and threats. This paper presents a smart helmet prototype that monitors the conditions in the workers' environment and performs a near real-time evaluation of risks. The data collected by sensors is sent to an AI-driven platform for analysis. The training dataset consisted of 11,755 samples and 12 different scenarios. As part of this research, a comparative study of the state-of-the-art models of supervised learning is carried out. Moreover, the use of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is proposed for the detection of possible occupational risks. The data are processed to make them suitable for the CNN and the results are compared against a Static Neural Network (NN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), where the CNN had an accuracy of 92.05% in cross-validation.", "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in biomedical research promises to unlock new information from the vast amounts of data being generated through the delivery of healthcare and the expanding high-throughput research applications. Such information can aid medical diagnoses and reveal various unique patterns of biochemical and immune features that can serve as early disease biomarkers. In this report, we demonstrate the feasibility of using an AI/ML approach in a relatively small dataset to discriminate among three categories of samples obtained from mice that either rejected or tolerated their pancreatic islet allografts following transplant in the anterior chamber of the eye, and from na\u00efve controls. We created a locked software based on a support vector machine (SVM) technique for pattern recognition in electropherograms (EPGs) generated by micellar electrokinetic chromatography and laser induced fluorescence detection (MEKC-LIFD). Predictions were made based only on the aligned EPGs obtained in microliter-size aqueous humor samples representative of the immediate local microenvironment of the islet allografts. The analysis identified discriminative peaks in the EPGs of the three sample categories. Our classifier software was tested with targeted and untargeted peaks. Working with the patterns of untargeted peaks (i.e., based on the whole pattern of EPGs), it was able to achieve a 21 out of 22 positive classification score with a corresponding 95.45% prediction accuracy among the three sample categories, and 100% accuracy between the rejecting and tolerant recipients. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of AI/ML approaches to classify small numbers of samples and they warrant further studies to identify the analytes/biochemicals corresponding to discriminative features as potential biomarkers of islet allograft immune rejection and tolerance.", "This interview-based qualitative study aims to explore how healthcare providers conceptualise trace-based communication and considers its implications for how teams work. In the biological literature, trace-based communication refers to the non-verbal communication that is achieved by leaving 'traces' in the environment and other members sensing them and using them to drive their own behaviour. Trace-based communication is a key component of swam intelligence and has been described as a critical process that enables superorganisms to coordinate work and collectively adapt. This paper brings awareness to its existence in the context of healthcare teamwork.\nInterview-based study using Constructivist Grounded Theory methodology.\nThis study was conducted in multiple team contexts at one of Canada's largest acute-care teaching hospitals.\n25 clinicians from across professions and disciplines. Specialties included surgery, anesthesiology, psychiatry, internal medicine, geriatrics, neonatology, paramedics, nursing, intensive care, neurology and emergency medicine.\nNot relevant due to the qualitative nature of the study.\nNot relevant due to the qualitative nature of the study.\nThe dataset was analysed using the sensitising concept of 'traces' from Swarm Intelligence. This study brought to light novel and unique elements of trace-based communication in the context of healthcare teamwork including focused intentionality, successful versus failed traces and the contextually bounded nature of the responses to traces. While participants initially felt ambivalent about the idea of using traces in their daily teamwork, they provided a variety of examples. Through these examples, participants revealed the multifaceted nature of the purposes of trace-based communication, including promoting efficiency, preventing mistakes and saving face.\nThis study demonstrated that clinicians pervasively use trace-based communication despite differences in opinion as to its implications for teamwork and safety. Other disciplines have taken up traces to promote collective adaptation. This should serve as inspiration to at least start exploring this phenomenon in healthcare.", "Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses computer-based algorithms and methods to gain insights from large and often complex datasets. Data science, which includes Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), has been credited with the promise to transform Health Professions Education (HPE) by offering approaches to handle big (and often messy) data. To examine this promise, we conducted a critical review to explore: (1) published applications of data science and ML in HPE literature and (2) the potential role of data science and ML in shifting theoretical and epistemological perspectives in HPE research and practice. Existing data science studies in HPE are often not informed by theory, but rather oriented towards developing applications for specific problems, uses, and contexts. The most common areas currently being studied are procedural (e.g., computer-based tutoring or adaptive systems and assessment of technical skills). We found that epistemic beliefs informing the use of data science and ML in HPE poses a challenge for existing views on what constitutes objective knowledge and the role of human subjectivity for instruction and assessment. As a result, criticisms have emerged that the integration of data science in the field of HPE is in danger of becoming technically driven and narrowly focused in its approach to teaching, learning and assessment. Our findings suggest that researchers tend to formalize around the epistemological stance driven largely by traditions of a research paradigm. Future data science studies in HPE need to involve both education scientists and data scientists to ensure mutual advancements in the development of educational theory and practical applications. This may be one of the most important tasks in the integration of data science and ML in HPE research in the years to come.", "Neurotoxicity studies are important in the preclinical stages of drug development process, because exposure to certain compounds that may enter the brain across a permeable blood brain barrier damages neurons and other supporting cells such as astrocytes. This could, in turn, lead to various neurological disorders such as Parkinson's or Huntington's disease as well as various dementias. Toxicity assessment is often done by pathologists after these exposures by qualitatively or semiquantitatively grading the severity of neurotoxicity in histopathology slides. Quantification of the extent of neurotoxicity supports qualitative histopathological analysis and provides a better understanding of the global extent of brain damage. Stereological techniques such as the utilization of an optical fractionator provide an unbiased quantification of the neuronal damage; however, the process is time-consuming. Advent of whole slide imaging (WSI) introduced digital image analysis which made quantification of neurotoxicity automated, faster and with reduced bias, making statistical comparisons possible. Although automated to a certain level, simple digital image analysis requires manual efforts of experts which is time-consuming and limits analysis of large datasets. Digital image analysis coupled with a deep learning artificial intelligence model provides a good alternative solution to time-consuming stereological and simple digital analysis. Deep learning models could be trained to identify damaged or dead neurons in an automated fashion. This review has focused on and discusses studies demonstrating the role of deep learning in segmentation of brain regions, toxicity detection and quantification of degenerated neurons as well as the estimation of area/volume of degeneration.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of science and engineering concerned with the computational understanding of what is commonly called intelligent behavior. AI is extremely useful in many human activities including medicine. The aim of our narrative review is to show the potential role of AI in fighting antimicrobial resistance in pediatric patients. We searched for PubMed articles published from April 2010 to April 2020 containing the keywords \"artificial intelligence\", \"machine learning\", \"antimicrobial resistance\", \"antimicrobial stewardship\", \"pediatric\", and \"children\", and we described the different strategies for the application of AI in these fields. Literature analysis showed that the applications of AI in health care are potentially endless, contributing to a reduction in the development time of new antimicrobial agents, greater diagnostic and therapeutic appropriateness, and, simultaneously, a reduction in costs. Most of the proposed AI solutions for medicine are not intended to replace the doctor's opinion or expertise, but to provide a useful tool for easing their work. Considering pediatric infectious diseases, AI could play a primary role in fighting antibiotic resistance. In the pediatric field, a greater willingness to invest in this field could help antimicrobial stewardship reach levels of effectiveness that were unthinkable a few years ago.", "Istrian shorthaired hound is an old indigenous Croatian dog breed with historical traces of its origin, which date back to the 14th century. Due to its intelligence and great hunting abilities, it is considered an excellent hunting dog. Despite its ancient origin, there is no data on genetic diversity, population structure, and degree of inbreeding that could be used for advanced management and conservation of this breed. Our study aimed to provide a high-resolution population structure of the Istrian shorthaired hound using a 220K HD SNP array, to compare the obtained data with the genealogical records and to place the breed in a broader context of world dog populations. Relatively high population size and low inbreeding coefficient estimated from genealogical data indicate a preserved genetic diversity in this breed. The principle component analysis, the NeighborNet network, and TreeMix were used to determine the genetic relationship between the Istrian shorthaired hound and other breeds. The Istrian shorthaired hound was found to be genetically related to Italian hunting dogs sharing the same branch with the Segugio Italiano a Pelo Raso and Segugio Italiano a Pelo Forte. The ADMIXTURE analysis indicated that the Istrian shorthaired hound could be involved in the development of some other hunting dog breeds. The estimated effective population size (Ne) based on SNP data was similar to Ne calculated from genealogical data indicating the absence of bottlenecks and well-balanced use of breeding animals. The low genomic inbreeding coefficient, together with the higher number of short runs of homozygosity, observed in the Istrian shorthaired hound, confirms the ancient origin of the breed based on historical documents. The analysis of selective sweeps identified genomic regions with the strongest selection signals in the vicinity of the genes associated with cognitive performance and behavior. Genome analysis proved to be a useful tool for estimating population parameters and can be implemented in the conservation plan for this indigenous breed.", "Pancreatic cancer is a malignant form of cancer with one of the worst prognoses. The poor prognosis and resistance to therapeutic modalities have been linked to TP53 mutation. Pathological examinations, such as biopsies, cannot be frequently performed in clinical practice; therefore, noninvasive and reproducible methods are desired. However, automatic prediction methods based on imaging have drawbacks such as poor 3D information utilization, small sample size, and ineffectiveness multi-modal fusion. In this study, we proposed a model-driven multi-modal deep learning scheme to overcome these challenges. A spiral transformation algorithm was developed to obtain 2D images from 3D data, with the transformed image inheriting and retaining the spatial correlation of the original texture and edge information. The spiral transformation could be used to effectively apply the 3D information with less computational resources and conveniently augment the data size with high quality. Moreover, model-driven items were designed to introduce prior knowledge in the deep learning framework for multi-modal fusion. The model-driven strategy and spiral transformation-based data augmentation can improve the performance of the small sample size. A bilinear pooling module was introduced to improve the performance of fine-grained prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed model gives the desired performance in predicting TP53 mutation in pancreatic cancer, providing a new approach for noninvasive gene prediction. The proposed methodologies of spiral transformation and model-driven deep learning can also be used for the artificial intelligence community dealing with oncological applications. Our source codes with a demon will be released at https://github.com/SJTUBME-QianLab/SpiralTransform.", "Social distancing with the aim of avoiding infections and pre-serve critical care capacities during the COVID-19 pandemic has been implemented in Germany according to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations from early March onwards. Limitations of physical contacts to reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were handled strictly, particularly in medical centers dealing with airway diseases, like rhinology and pneumology clinics. Such measures and reluctance to visit out- and inpatient services resulted in a 82% decrease in consultations to the 12 German oto-rhino-laryngological (ORL) centres forming our database during the 50 days following March 09 in 2020 if compared to the same period in 2019. Our data on CRS care underline reports on undertreatment of non-COVID-19 individuals with several different diseases during the current pandemic.

The used 3D biometry calculates systematically a 164 set of parameters able to take into account all kinds of disharmonies; among which 38 parameters are specifically devoted to anterior-posterior \"off asymmetry\" pathologies. Then the specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs treat morphological data and give textual diagnoses. Analysis of the global sample aims to control the efficiency, separating different sub-samples one each other: t test appreciates efficiency of each parameter to recognize clinical sub-sample. The correlation coefficient, r, between each parameter and pseudo Angle molars Class II (GMMy-Gmmy) give the importance of its tie with Class II pathology. Presentation of parameters medium values in each sub-group gives the medium profiles. By direct comparison of patient's parameters values with medium profile, it is possible to locate patient's pathology. So we can take in account new parameters like arches upper/lower gap, anterior bases upper/lower gap, compensatingparameters... It is then possible to make more secure the clinical decision.", "The diagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is challenging owing to extensive variation in paediatric pelvic anatomy. Artificial intelligence (AI) may represent an effective diagnostic tool for DDH. Here, we aimed to develop an anteroposterior pelvic radiograph deep learning system for diagnosing DDH in children and analyze the feasibility of its application.\nIn total, 10,219 anteroposterior pelvic radiographs were retrospectively collected from April 2014 to December 2018. Clinicians labelled each radiograph using a uniform standard method. Radiographs were grouped according to age and into 'dislocation' (dislocation and subluxation) and 'non-dislocation' (normal cases and those with dysplasia of the acetabulum) groups based on clinical diagnosis. The deep learning system was trained and optimized using 9,081 radiographs; 1,138 test radiographs were then used to compare the diagnoses made by deep learning system and clinicians. The accuracy of the deep learning system was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve, and the consistency of acetabular index measurements was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots.\nIn all, 1,138 patients (242 males; 896 females; mean age 1.5 years (SD 1.79; 0 to 10) were included in this study. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity of the deep learning system for diagnosing hip dislocation were 0.975, 276/289 (95.5%), and 1,978/1,987 (99.5%), respectively. Compared with clinical diagnoses, the Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement for acetabular index, as determined by the deep learning system from the radiographs of non-dislocated and dislocated hips, were -3.27\u00b0 - 2.94\u00b0 and -7.36\u00b0 - 5.36\u00b0, respectively (p < 0.001).\nThe deep learning system was highly consistent, more convenient, and more effective for diagnosing DDH compared with clinician-led diagnoses. Deep learning systems should be considered for analysis of anteroposterior pelvic radiographs when diagnosing DDH. The deep learning system will improve the current artificially complicated screening referral process.

Healthcare is undergoing a transformation, and it is imperative to leverage new technologies to generate new data and support the advent of precision medicine (PM). Recent scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements have improved our disease knowledge and altered diagnosis and treatment approaches resulting in a more precise, predictive, preventative and personalized health care that is customized for the individual patient. Consequently, the big data revolution has provided an opportunity to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to mine such a vast data set. Additionally, personalized medicine promises to revolutionize healthcare, with its key goal of providing the right treatment to the right patient at the right time and dose, and thus the potential of improving quality of life and helping to bring down healthcare costs.This policy briefing will look in detail at the issues surrounding continued development, sustained investment, risk factors, testing and approval of innovations for better strategy and faster process. The paper will serve as a policy bridge that is required to enhance a conscious decision among the powers-that-be in Qatar in order to find a way to harmonize multiple strands of activity and responsibility in the health arena. The end goal will be for Qatar to enhance public awareness and engagement and to integrate effectively the incredible advances in research into healthcare systems, for the benefit of all patients.The PM policy briefing provides concrete recommendations on moving forward with PM initiatives in Qatar and internationally. Equally important, integration of PM within a primary care setting, building a coalition of community champions through awareness and advocacy, finally, communicating PM value, patient engagement/empowerment and education/continued professional development programs of the healthcare workforce.Key recommendations for implementation of precision medicine inside and outside Qatar: 1. Create Community Awareness and PM Education Programs 2. Engage and Empower Patients 3. Communicate PM Value 4. Develop appropriate Infrastructure and Information Management Systems 5. Integrate PM into standard Healthcare System and Ensure Access to Care PM is no longer futuristic. It is here. Implementing PM in routine clinical care does require some investment and infrastructure development. Invariably, cost and lack of expertise are cited as barriers to PM implementation. Equally consequential, are the curriculum and professional development of medical care experts.Policymakers need to lead and coordinate effort among stakeholders and consider cultural and faith perspectives to ensure success. It is essential that policymakers integrate PM approaches into national strategies to improve health and health care for all, and to drive towards the future of medicine precision health.", "Emerging and re-emerging viral diseases poses a threat to living organisms, and led to serious concern to humankind and public health. The last two decades, viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) reported in the years 2002-2003, and H1N1 influenza (Swine flu) in 2009, middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) from Saudi Arabia in 2012, Ebola virus in 2014-2016, and Zika virus in 2015. The recent outbreak of 2019-CoV-2 or severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2), novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, or 2019 disease, COVID-19) in Dec 2019, from, Wuhan city of China, has severe implications of health concerns to the whole world, due to global spread and high health risk. More than 423349 deaths had occurred globally and is still increasing every day. The whole world is under a health emergency, and people are advised to stay at their homes to avoid the spread of person-to-person infection, and advised to maintain social distancing. The advancement in clinical diagnosis techniques like Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR), immunological, microscopy, and geographic information system (GIS) mapping technology helped in tacking the rapid diagnosis and tracking viral infection in a short period. In the same way, artificial intelligence (AI), combinatorial chemistry, and deep learning approaches help to find novel therapeutics in less time and wide applicability in biomedical research. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has started the clinical trials of investigation COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, we can expect vaccines to be available for this deadly disease in the coming few months.", "With the continued spread of COVID-19 across the world, rapid diagnostic tools, readily available respurposable drugs, and prompt containment measures to control the SARS-CoV-2 infection are of paramount importance. Examples of recent advances in diagnostic tests are CRISPR technology, IgG assay, spike protein detection, and use of artificial intelligence. The gold standard reverse transcription polymerase chain (RT-PCR) has also been upgraded with point-of-care rapid tests. Supportive treatment, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remain the primary choice, while therapeutic options include antivirals, antiparasitics, anti-inflammatories, interferon, convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibody, hyperimmunoglobulin, RNAi, and mesenchymal stem cell therapy. Different types of vaccines such as RNA, DNA, and lentiviral, inactivated, and viral vector are in clinical trials. Moreover, rapidly deployable and easy-to-transport innovative vaccine delivery systems are also in development. As countries have started easing down on the lockdown measures, the chance for a second wave of infection demands strict and rational control policies to keep fatalities minimized. An improved understanding of the advances in diagnostic tools, treatments, vaccines, and control measures for COVID-19 can provide references for further research and aid better containment strategies.", "Cytokine storm resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the leading causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and lung fibrosis. We investigated the effect of inflammatory molecules to identify any marker that is related to lung fibrosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Seventy-six COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Youan Hospital between January 21 and March 20, 2020 and recovered were recruited for this study. Pulmonary fibrosis, represented as fibrotic volume on chest CT images, was computed by an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted program. Plasma samples were collected from the participants shortly after admission, to measure the basal inflammatory molecules levels. At discharge, fibrosis was present in 46 (60.5%) patients whose plasma interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) levels were twofold lower than those without fibrosis (p > 0.05). The multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analysis demonstrated the inverse association risk of having lung fibrosis and basal circulating IFN-\u03b3 levels with an estimate of 0.43 (p = 0.02). Per the 1-SD increase of basal IFN-\u03b3 level in circulation, the fibrosis volume decreased by 0.070% (p = 0.04) at the discharge of participants. The basal circulating IFN-\u03b3 levels were comparable with c-reactive protein in the discrimination of the occurrence of lung fibrosis among COVID-19 patients at discharge, unlike circulating IL-6 levels. In conclusion, these data indicate that decreased circulating IFN-\u03b3 is a risk factor of lung fibrosis in COVID-19.", "Automatic robot gripper system which involves the automated object recognition of work-in-process in production line is the key technology of the upcoming manufacturing facility achieving Industry 4.0.

Specifically, we compared language performance measured by norm-referenced measures compared with spontaneous language sample measures.\nNonverbal intelligence and spoken language skills were analyzed using norm-referenced nonverbal intelligence and language assessments and language sample analyses in 92 children ages 3 to 6 who varied by hearing and nonverbal intelligence status. All children had nonverbal intelligence within the average or above-average range.\nRegression analyses revealed that, after controlling for maternal education and hearing status, nonverbal intelligence contributed unique variance to norm-referenced language measures but not spontaneous language measures.\nPerformance on norm-referenced language measures is influenced by nonverbal intelligence, whereas functional language use measured by spontaneous language samples is not. These findings suggest that spontaneous language measures may contribute additional value to language assessment batteries that are independent of nonverbal intelligence.", "Covid-19 is a dangerous communicable virus which lets down the world economy. Severe respiratory syndrome SARS-COV-2 leads to Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) and has the capability of transmission through human-to-human and surface-to-human transmission leads the world to catastrophic phase. Computational system based biological signal analysis helps medical officers in handling COVID-19 tasks like ECG monitoring at Intensive care, fatal ventricular fibrillation, etc., This paper is on diagnosing heart dysfunctions such as tachycardia, bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrhythmia using fuzzy relations and artificial intelligence algorithm. In this study, the heart pulse base signal and features like spectral entropy, largest lyapunov exponent, Poincare plot and detrended fluctuation analysis are extracted and presented for classification purpose. The RR intervals of Poincare plot summarize RR time series obtained from an ECG in one picture, and a time interval quantities derives information duration of HRV. This analysis eases the prediction of heart rate fluctuation due to Covid or other heart disorders. The better accuracy level in diagnosing heart pulse irregularity using Artificial Neural network(ANN) is an integer value (0 to 4)but for Fuzzy Classifier, it is 0.8 to 0.9.The processing time for analyzing heart dysfunctionalties is 0.05\u202fs using ANN which is far better than Fuzzy classifier.", "The application of big data, radiomics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in radiology requires access to large data sets containing personal health information. Because machine learning projects often require collaboration between different sites or data transfer to a third party, precautions are required to safeguard patient privacy. Safety measures are required to prevent inadvertent access to and transfer of identifiable information. The Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) is the national voice of radiology committed to promoting the highest standards in patient-centered imaging, lifelong learning, and research. The CAR has created an AI Ethical and Legal standing committee with the mandate to guide the medical imaging community in terms of best practices in data management, access to health care data, de-identification, and accountability practices.

Reference values were obtained using a calibrated scale and a measuring tape to train a machine learning algorithm that fits a patient avatar into the recorded patient surface data. The resulting algorithm was prospectively used on 101 patients in clinical practice and the results were compared to the reference values and to estimates by the patient himself, the radiographer and the radiologist. The body mass index was calculated from the collected values for each patient using the WHO formula. A tolerance level of 5\u200akg was defined in order to evaluate the impact on weight-dependent contrast agent dosage in abdominal CT.\nDifferences between values for height, weight and BMI were non-significant over all assessments (p\u200a>\u200a0.83). The most accurate values for weight were obtained from the patient information (R\u00b2\u200a=\u200a0.99) followed by the automated estimation via 3D camera (R\u00b2\u200a=\u200a0.89). Estimates by medical staff were considerably less precise (radiologist: R\u00b2\u200a=\u200a0.78, radiographer: R\u00b2\u200a=\u200a0.77).

Early identification and evidence-based treatment of sepsis are associated with improved outcomes.Areas covered: This narrative review was undertaken following a PubMed search for English language reports published before July 2020 using the terms 'sepsis,' 'septic shock,' 'fluids,' 'fluid therapy,' 'albumin,' 'corticosteroids,' 'vasopressor.' Emerging management strategies were identified following a search of the ClinicalTrails.gov database using the term 'sepsis.' Additional reports were identified by examining the reference lists of selected articles and based on personnel knowledge of the field of sepsis.Expert opinion: The core treatment of sepsis relies on source control, early antibiotics, and organ support. The main emerging strategies focus on immunomodulation, artificial intelligence, and on multi-omics approaches for a personalized therapy.", "Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) have limited treatment options and have a deteriorated quality of life with an uncertain prognosis. Early identification of ESLD patients with a poor prognosis is valuable, especially for palliative care. However, it is difficult to predict ESLD patients that require either acute care or palliative care.\nWe sought to create a machine-learning monitoring system that can predict mortality or classify ESLD patients. Several machine-learning models with visualized graphs, decision trees, ensemble learning, and clustering were assessed.\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic medical records of patients from Wan Fang Hospital and Taipei Medical University Hospital. A total of 1214 patients from Wan Fang Hospital were used to establish a dataset for training and 689 patients from Taipei Medical University Hospital were used as a validation set.\nThe overall mortality rate of patients in the training set and validation set was 28.3% (257/907) and 22.6% (145/643), respectively. In traditional clinical scoring models, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio, which was significant in the Cox regression (P<.001, hazard ratio 1.288), had a prominent influence on predicting mortality, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve reached approximately 0.75. In supervised machine-learning models, the concordance statistic of ROC curves reached 0.852 for the random forest model and reached 0.833 for the adaptive boosting model. Blood urea nitrogen, bilirubin, and sodium were regarded as critical factors for predicting mortality. Creatinine, hemoglobin, and albumin were also significant mortality predictors. In unsupervised learning models, hierarchical clustering analysis could accurately group acute death patients and palliative care patients into different clusters from patients in the survival group.\nMedical artificial intelligence has become a cutting-edge tool in clinical medicine, as it has been found to have predictive ability in several diseases. The machine-learning monitoring system developed in this study involves multifaceted analyses, which include various aspects for evaluation and diagnosis. This strength makes the clinical results more objective and reliable. Moreover, the visualized interface in this system offers more intelligible outcomes. Therefore, this machine-learning monitoring system provides a comprehensive approach for assessing patient condition, and may help to classify acute death patients and palliative care patients. Upon further validation and improvement, the system may be used to help physicians in the management of ESLD patients.", "Background and study aims\u2002 Recently, a growing body of evidence has been amassed on evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) known as deep learning in computer-aided diagnosis of gastrointestinal lesions by means of convolutional neural networks (CNN). We conducted this meta-analysis to study pooled rates of performance for CNN-based AI in diagnosis of gastrointestinal neoplasia from endoscopic images. Methods\u2002 Multiple databases were searched (from inception to November 2019) and studies that reported on the performance of AI by means of CNN in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal tumors were selected. A random effects model was used and pooled accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Pooled rates were categorized based on the gastrointestinal location of lesion (esophagus, stomach and colorectum). Results\u2002 Nineteen studies were included in our final analysis. The pooled accuracy of CNN in esophageal neoplasia was 87.2\u200a% (76-93.6) and NPV was 92.1\u200a% (85.9-95.7); the accuracy in lesions of stomach was 85.8\u200a% (79.8-90.3) and NPV was 92.1\u200a% (85.9-95.7); and in colorectal neoplasia the accuracy was 89.9\u200a% (82-94.7) and NPV was 94.3\u200a% (86.4-97.7). Conclusions\u2002 Based on our meta-analysis, CNN-based AI achieved high accuracy in diagnosis of lesions in esophagus, stomach, and colorectum.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges for the U.S. healthcare system due to the staggering mismatch between healthcare system capacity and patient demand. The healthcare industry has been a relatively slow adopter of digital innovation due to the conventional belief that humans need to be at the center of healthcare delivery tasks. However, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence (AI) may be used to carry out specific tasks such as pre-hospital triage and enable clinicians to deliver care at scale. Recognizing that the majority of COVID-19 cases are mild and do not require hospitalization, Partners HealthCare (now Mass General Brigham) implemented a digitally-automated pre-hospital triage solution to direct patients to the appropriate care setting before they showed up at the emergency department and clinics, which would otherwise consume resources, expose other patients and staff to potential viral transmission, and further exacerbate supply-and-demand mismatching. Although the use of AI has been well-established in other industries to optimize supply and demand matching, the introduction of AI to perform tasks remotely that were traditionally performed in-person by clinical staff represents a significant milestone in healthcare operations strategy.", "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have greatly advanced and become a reality in many areas of our daily lives. In the health care field, numerous efforts are being made to implement the AI technology for practical medical treatments. With the rapid developments in machine learning algorithms and improvements in hardware performances, the AI technology is expected to play an important role in effectively analyzing and utilizing extensive amounts of health and medical data. However, the AI technology has various unique characteristics that are different from the existing health care technologies. Subsequently, there are a number of areas that need to be supplemented within the current health care system for the AI to be utilized more effectively and frequently in health care. In addition, the number of medical practitioners and public that accept AI in the health care is still low; moreover, there are various concerns regarding the safety and reliability of AI technology implementations. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce the current research and application status of AI technology in health care and discuss the issues that need to be resolved.", "The last decade has witnessed the healthcare system going paperless with increased use of electronic healthcare records. Artificial intelligence tools including smartphones and smart watches have changed the landscape of day-to-day lives. Digitisation, decentralisation of healthcare and empowerment of allied healthcare providers and patients themselves have made shared clinical decision-making a reality. The year 2020 quickly turned into an unprecedented time in our lives with the entry of COVID-19. Amidst a pandemic, healthcare systems rapidly adapted and transformed, and changes that otherwise would have taken a decade, took a mere few weeks (Webster, Lancet 395:1180-1, 2020). This essay reviews evidence of transformation in the realm of hypertension management, namely diagnosis, lifestyle changes, therapeutics and prevention of hypertension at both individual and population levels, and presents an extrapolation of how this transformation might shape the next decade.", "Early identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an essential healthcare priority. Girls may be at risk for late diagnosis, although research is equivocal regarding how sex and other factors relate to ASD identification. The goals of the current investigation were to (1) identify how child sex, cognitive abilities, and demographic factors relate to age of first concern (AOC) and age of diagnosis (AOD), (2) evaluate trends in AOC/AOD over time, and (3) consider whether main effects of sex on AOC/AOD are moderated by cognitive abilities or time.\nChildren (N\u00a0=\u00a0365; 20% female; 85.6% identified as White) with ASD participated through the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorders (POND) Network. Study records included AOD, date/timing of diagnosis (between 1996 and 2017), age of first parent concern, demographics, and standardized cognitive testing results (24.7% of children had IQ scores below standard scores of 70).\nAverage AOC occurred before 2\u00a0years of age whereas average AOD occurred after 5\u00a0years of age. Girls did not differ on AOC but had a later AOD than boys. Higher verbal IQ was associated with later AOD more strongly in girls than boys. Regarding time-related changes, average AOC and AOD increased across the study period, more strongly for girls.\nResults support that sex is a key factor underlying delays in ASD identification and highlight the urgent need to improve diagnostic practices among girls. Limitations and implications for improving the diagnostic process are discussed.\nAbbreviations: ASD=autism spectrum disorder; IQ=intelligence quotient; AOC=parental report of age of first concern; AOD=age of diagnosis.", "The incorporation of digital pathology into routine pathology practice is becoming more widespread. Definite advantages exist with respect to the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning in pathology, including cytopathology. However, there are also unique challenges in this regard.\nThis review discusses cytology-specific challenges, including the need to implement digital cytology prior to AI; the large file sizes and increased acquisition times for whole slide images in cytology; the routine use of multiple stains, such as Papanicolaou and Romanowsky stains; the lack of high-quality annotated datasets on which to train algorithms; and the considerable computer resources required, in terms of both computer infrastructure and skilled personnel, for computing and storage of data. Global concerns regarding AI that are certainly applicable to cytology include the need for model validation and continued quality assurance, ethical issues such as the use of patient data in developing algorithms, the need to develop regulatory frameworks regarding what type of data can be utilized and ensuring cybersecurity during data collection and storage, and algorithm development. Key Messages: While AI will likely play a role in cytology practice in the future, applying this technology to cytology poses a unique set of challenges. A broad understanding of digital pathology and algorithm development is desirable to guide the development of algorithms, as well as the need to be cognizant of potential pitfalls to avoid when incorporating the technology in practice.", "The number of patients requiring hip and knee arthroplasty continues to rise each year. Patients are living longer and expecting to remain active into later life following joint replacement. Developments in computer-assisted surgery and robotic technology may optimise surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction following lower limb arthroplasty.

This article reviews the use of artificial intelligence and surgical innovation in lower limb arthroplasty, with a particular focus on robotic-assisted surgery in total knee arthroplasty.", "The recent global outbreak and spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) makes it an imperative to develop accurate and efficient diagnostic tools for the disease as medical resources are getting increasingly constrained. Artificial intelligence (AI)-aided tools have exhibited desirable potential; for example, chest computed tomography (CT) has been demonstrated to play a major role in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19. However, developing a CT-based AI diagnostic system for the disease detection has faced considerable challenges, which is mainly due to the lack of adequate manually-delineated samples for training, as well as the requirement of sufficient sensitivity to subtle lesions in the early infection stages. In this study, we developed a dual-branch combination network (DCN) for COVID-19 diagnosis that can simultaneously achieve individual-level classification and lesion segmentation. To focus the classification branch more intensively on the lesion areas, a novel lesion attention module was developed to integrate the intermediate segmentation results. Furthermore, to manage the potential influence of different imaging parameters from individual facilities, a slice probability mapping method was proposed to learn the transformation from slice-level to individual-level classification. We conducted experiments on a large dataset of 1202 subjects from ten institutes in China. The results demonstrated that 1) the proposed DCN attained a classification accuracy of 96.74% on the internal dataset and 92.87% on the external validation dataset, thereby outperforming other models; 2) DCN obtained comparable performance with fewer samples and exhibited higher sensitivity, especially in subtle lesion detection; and 3) DCN provided good interpretability on the loci of infection compared to other deep models due to its classification guided by high-level semantic information. An online CT-based diagnostic platform for COVID-19 derived from our proposed framework is now available.", "The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project was proposed by the National Institute of Mental Health in 2010 to create a new diagnostic system including symptoms and data from genetics, neuroscience, physiology, and self-reports. The purpose of this study was to determine the link between anxiety and executive functions through quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) based on the RDoC system. Nineteen-channel EEGs were recorded at the psychiatric clinic from 41 patients with symptoms of anxiety. The EEG power spectra were analysed. The Executive Intelligence Test (EXIT) including the K-WAIS-IV, Stroop, controlled oral word association, and the design fluency tests were performed. A partial, inversed, and significant association was observed between executive intelligence quotient (EIQ) and the absolute delta power in the central region. Similarly, a partial, inversed, and significant association was observed between design fluency and the absolute delta power in the left parietal area. Our findings suggest that the increase in delta power in the central region and left P3 was negatively correlated with the decrease in executive function. It is expected that the absolute delta power plays a specific role in the task-negative default mode network in the relationship between anxiety and executive function.", "Intelligence is a form of advanced cognition that includes reasoning, problem solving, pattern recognition, and establishing relationships among items. The amygdala plays an important role in cognitive processing, but the relationship between amygdalar function and intelligence has rarely been explored directly. Here, we investigated the relationship between resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the amygdala and intelligence test performance in a large sample of healthy adults (N\u00a0=\u00a0197). We found that two pairs of RSFCs were significantly increased in the high IQ group compared with that of the general IQ group. One of these RSFCs consisted of the right amygdala and the right superior parietal lobule, whereas the other RSFC consisted of the right amygdala and the left middle cingulum. In addition, we found that the brain regions in which the strength of RSFC significantly correlated with full IQ (FIQ) were mainly distributed in the parietal and limbic lobes. What's more, a further mediation analysis indicated that the functional connectivity of the right amygdala and the right superior parietal lobule significantly mediated the correlation between comprehension and object assembly, whereas the functional connectivity of the right amygdala and the left middle cingulum mediated the association between similarities and digit symbol. These findings suggest that amygdalar RSFC may reflect individual differences in intelligence and mediate specific relationships among different intellectual abilities.", "Globally, many research works are going on to study the infectious nature of COVID-19 and every day we learn something new about it through the flooding of the huge data that are accumulating hourly rather than daily which instantly opens hot research avenues for artificial intelligence researchers. However, the public's concern by now is to find answers for two questions; (1) When this COVID-19 pandemic will be over? and (2) After coming to its end, will COVID-19 return again in what is known as a second rebound of the pandemic? In this work, we developed a predictive model that can estimate the expected period that the virus can be stopped and the risk of the second rebound of COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we have considered the SARIMA model to predict the spread of the virus on several selected countries and used it for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic life cycle and its end. The study can be applied to predict the same for other countries as the nature of the virus is the same everywhere. The proposed model investigates the statistical estimation of the slowdown period of the pandemic which is extracted based on the concept of normal distribution. The advantages of this study are that it can help governments to act and make sound decisions and plan for future so that the anxiety of the people can be minimized and prepare the mentality of people for the next phases of the pandemic. Based on the experimental results and simulation, the most striking finding is that the proposed algorithm shows the expected COVID-19 infections for the top countries of the highest number of confirmed cases will be manifested between Dec-2020\u00a0and \u00a0Apr-2021. Moreover, our study forecasts that there may be a second rebound of the pandemic in a year time if the currently taken precautions are eased completely. We have to consider the uncertain nature of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the growing inter-connected and complex world, that are ultimately demanding flexibility, robustness and resilience to cope with the unexpected future events and scenarios.", "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has threatened public health as a global pandemic.

It is often difficult to explain multifactorial diseases such as cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases by a single hypothesis. In such case, a data-driven approach is essential to construct individualized models based on comprehensive observation of the target disease. The data-driven approach utilizes artificial intelligence to extract, predict, and classify patterns of data, considering different types of variables and complex dependencies between variables. In this paper, we introduce the basic idea, typical methods, and application examples of artificial intelligence and its core technology, machine learning. We would like to discuss a new framework of medical research toward the next generation medicine, while reviewing how machine learning is used in precise prediction and data-driven redefinition of diseases.", "Due to the rapid progression and poor prognosis of esophageal cancer (EC), the early detection and diagnosis of early EC are of great value for the prognosis improvement of patients. However, the endoscopic detection of early EC, especially Barrett's dysplasia or squamous epithelial dysplasia, is difficult. Therefore, the requirement for more efficient methods of detection and characterization of early EC has led to intensive research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Deep learning (DL) has brought about breakthroughs in processing images, videos, and other aspects, whereas convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shone lights on detection of endoscopic images and videos. Many studies on CNNs in endoscopic analysis of early EC demonstrate excellent performance including sensitivity and specificity and progress gradually from in vitro image analysis for classification to real-time detection of early esophageal neoplasia. When AI technique comes to the pathological diagnosis, borderline lesions that are difficult to determine may become easier than before. In gene diagnosis, due to the lack of tissue specificity of gene diagnostic markers, they can only be used as supplementary measures at present. In predicting the risk of cancer, there is still a lack of prospective clinical research to confirm the accuracy of the risk stratification model.", "Deep learning has recently achieved remarkable results in the field of medical imaging. However, as a deep learning network becomes deeper to improve its performance, it becomes more difficult to interpret the processes within. This can especially be a critical problem in medical fields where diagnostic decisions are directly related to a patient's survival. In order to solve this, explainable artificial intelligence techniques are being widely studied, and an attention mechanism was developed as part of this approach. In this paper, attention techniques are divided into two types: post hoc attention, which aims to analyze a network that has already been trained, and trainable attention, which further improves network performance. Detailed comparisons of each method, examples of applications in medical imaging, and future perspectives will be covered.\n\ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \uae30\uc220\uc740 \ube45\ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc0f \ucef4\ud4e8\ud305 \ud30c\uc6cc\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uadfc \uc601\uc0c1\uc758\ud559 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad04\ubaa9\ud560\ub9cc\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4 \ub0b4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub525\ub7ec\ub2dd \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uac00 \uae4a\uc5b4\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d \uadf8 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc758 \uacc4\uc0b0 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\uc84c\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \ud658\uc790\uc758 \uc0dd\uba85\uacfc \uc9c1\uacb0\ub418\ub294 \uc758\ub8cc\ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac \uacb0\uc815 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \u201c\uc124\uba85 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\uc220\u201d\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8\uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub85c \uac1c\ubc1c\ub41c \uac83\uc774 \ubc14\ub85c \uc5b4\ud150\uc158(attention) \uae30\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc885\uc124\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ubbf8 \ud559\uc2b5\uc774 \uc644\ub8cc\ub41c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c Post-hoc attention\uacfc, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uc131\ub2a5\uc758 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c Trainable attention \ub450 \uc885\ub958\uc758 \uae30\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac01\uac01\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95 \ubc0f \uc758\ub8cc \uc601\uc0c1 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub41c \uc0ac\ub840, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc804\ub9dd \ub4f1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc790\uc138\ud788 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "In the past few years, we have witnessed a renaissance of the field of molecular de novo drug design. The advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have triggered an avalanche of ideas on how to translate such techniques to a variety of domains including the field of drug design. A range of architectures have been devised to find the optimal way of generating chemical compounds by using either graph- or string (SMILES)-based representations. With this application note, we aim to offer the community a production-ready tool for de novo design, called REINVENT. It can be effectively applied on drug discovery projects that are striving to resolve either exploration or exploitation problems while navigating the chemical space. It can facilitate the idea generation process by bringing to the researcher's attention the most promising compounds. REINVENT's code is publicly available at https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent.", "Artificial intelligence could provide more accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predictors of successful clinical outcomes in targeted spine care.\nTo analyze the level of agreement between lumbar MRI reports created by a deep learning neural network (RadBot) and the radiologists' MRI reading.\nThe compressive pathology definitions were extracted from the radiologist lumbar MRI reports from 65 patients with a total of 383 levels for the central canal: (0) no disc bulge/protrusion/canal stenosis, (1) disc bulge without canal stenosis, (2) disc bulge resulting in canal stenosis, and (3) disc herniation/protrusion/extrusion resulting in canal stenosis. For both, neural foramina were assessed with either (0) neural foraminal stenosis absent or (1) neural foramina stenosis present. Reporting criteria for the pathologies at each disc level and, when available, the grading of severity were extracted, and the Natural Language Processing model was used to generate a verbal and written report. The RadBot report was analyzed similarly as the MRI report by the radiologist. MRI reports were investigated by dichotomizing the data into 2 categories: normal and stenosis. The quality of the RadBot test was assessed by determining its sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value as well as its reliability with the calculation of the Cronbach alpha and Cohen kappa using the radiologist MRI report as a gold standard.\nThe authors found a RadBot sensitivity of 73.3%, a specificity of 88.4%, a positive predictive value of 80.3%, and a negative predictive value of 83.7%. The reliability analysis revealed the Cronbach alpha as 0.772. The highest individual values of the Cronbach alpha were 0.629 and 0.681 when compared to the MRI report by the radiologist, rending values of 0.566 and 0.688, respectively. Analysis of interobserver reliability rendered an overall kappa for the RadBot of 0.627. Analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) showed a value of 0.808 for the area under the ROC curve.\nDeep learning algorithms, when used for routine reporting in lumbar spine MRI, showed excellent quality as a diagnostic test that can distinguish the presence of neural element compression (stenosis) at a statistically significant level (P < .0001) from a random event distribution. This research should be extended to validated and directly visualized pain generators to improve the accuracy and prognostic value of the routine lumbar MRI scan for favorable clinical outcomes with intervention and surgery.\n3.\nValidity, clinical teaching, and evaluation study.", "Volumetry is used in polycystic kidney and liver diseases (PKLDs), including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), to assess disease progression and drug efficiency. However, since no rapid and accurate method for volumetry has been developed, volumetry has not yet been established in clinical practice, hindering the development of therapies for PKLD. This study presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-based volumetry method for PKLD.\nThe performance of AI was first evaluated in comparison with ground-truth (GT). We trained a V-net-based convolutional neural network on 175 ADPKD computed tomography (CT) segmentations, which served as the GT and were agreed upon by 3 experts using images from 214 patients analyzed with volumetry. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC), interobserver correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots of 39 GT and AI segmentations in the validation set were compared. Next, the performance of AI on the segmentation of 50 random CT images was compared with that of 11 PKLD specialists based on the resulting DSC and ICC.\nThe DSC and ICC of the AI were 0.961 and 0.999729, respectively. The error rate was within 3% for approximately 95% of the CT scans (error<1%, 46.2%; 1%\u2264error<3%, 48.7%). Compared with the specialists, AI showed moderate performance. Furthermore, an outlier in our results confirmed that even PKLD specialists can make mistakes in volumetry.\nPKLD volumetry using AI was fast and accurate. AI performed comparably to human specialists, suggesting its use may be practical in clinical settings.", "Colonoscopy remains the standard strategy for screening for colorectal cancer around the world due to its efficacy in both detecting adenomatous or pre-cancerous lesions and the capacity to remove them intra-procedurally. Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD), thanks to the brand new developed innovations of artificial intelligence, and especially deep-learning techniques, leads to a promising solution to human biases in performance by guarantying decision support during colonoscopy. The application of CAD on real-time colonoscopy helps increasing the adenoma detection rate, and therefore contributes to reduce the incidence of interval cancers improving the effectiveness of colonoscopy screening on critical outcome such as colorectal cancer related mortality. Furthermore, a significant reduction in costs is also expected. In addition, the assistance of the machine will lead to a reduction of the examination time and therefore an optimization of the endoscopic schedule. The aim of this opinion review is to analyze the clinical applications of CAD and artificial intelligence in colonoscopy, as it is reported in literature, addressing evidence, limitations, and future prospects.", "We present P6, a declarative language for building high performance visual analytics systems through its support for specifying and integrating machine learning and interactive visualization methods. As data analysis methods based on machine learning and artificial intelligence continue to advance, a visual analytics solution can leverage these methods for better exploiting large and complex data. However, integrating machine learning methods with interactive visual analysis is challenging. Existing declarative programming libraries and toolkits for visualization lack support for coupling machine learning methods. By providing a declarative language for visual analytics, P6 can empower more developers to create visual analytics applications that combine machine learning and visualization methods for data analysis and problem solving. Through a variety of example applications, we demonstrate P6's capabilities and show the benefits of using declarative specifications to build visual analytics systems. We also identify and discuss the research opportunities and challenges for declarative visual analytics.", "Traditional methods for detection of lead ions in water samples are costly and time-consuming. In this work, an accurate smartphone-based colorimetric sensor was developed utilizing a novel machine learning algorithm. In the presence of Pb2+ ions in the solution of specifically functionalized gold nanoparticles, the color of solution turns from red to purple. Indeed, the color variation of the solution is proportional to Pb2+ concentration. The smartphone camera captures the corresponding color change, and the image is processed by an efficient artificial intelligence protocol. The nonlinear regression approach was used for concentration estimation, in which the parameters of the proposed model are obtained using a new feature extraction algorithm. In prediction of Pb2+ concentration, the average absolute error and root-mean-square error were 0.094 and 0.124, respectively. The influence of pH of the medium, temperature, oligonucleotide concentration, and reaction time on the performance of the proposed sensor was carefully investigated and understood to achieve the best sensor response. This novel sensor exhibited good linearity for the detection of Pb2+ in the concentration range of 0.5-2000 ppb with a detection limit of 0.5 ppb.", "Covid-19 disease can involve any organ system leading to myriad manifestations and complications. Cardiovascular manifestations are being increasingly recognised with the improved understanding of the disease. Acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy; heart failure and thromboembolic disease have all been described. The elderly and those with prior cardiac diseases are at an increased risk of mortality. Overlapping symptomatology, ability of drugs to cause QTc interval (start of Q wave to the end of T wave) prolongation on electrocardiogram and arrhythmias, potential drug interactions, the need to recognise patients requiring urgent definitive management and provide necessary bedside interventions without increasing the risk of nosocomial spread have made the management challenging. In the background of a pandemic, non-Covid-19 cardiac patients are affected by delayed treatment and nosocomial exposure. Triaging using telemedicine and artificial intelligence along with utilization of bedside rapid diagnostic tests to detect Covid-19 could prove helpful in this aspect.", "Given widespread interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to health data to improve patient care and health system efficiency, there is a need to understand the perspectives of the general public regarding the use of health data in AI research.\nA qualitative study involving six focus groups with members of the public. Participants discussed their views about AI in general, then were asked to share their thoughts about three realistic health AI research scenarios. Data were analysed using qualitative description thematic analysis.\nTwo cities in Ontario, Canada: Sudbury (400\u2009km north of Toronto) and Mississauga (part of the Greater Toronto Area).\nForty-one purposively sampled members of the public (21M:20F, 25-65 years, median age 40).\nParticipants had low levels of prior knowledge of AI and mixed, mostly negative, perceptions of AI in general. Most endorsed using data for health AI research when there is strong potential for public benefit, providing that concerns about privacy, commercial motives and other risks were addressed. Inductive thematic analysis identified AI-specific hopes (eg, potential for faster and more accurate analyses, ability to use more data), fears (eg, loss of human touch, skill depreciation from over-reliance on machines) and conditions (eg, human verification of computer-aided decisions, transparency). There were mixed views about whether data subject consent is required for health AI research, with most participants wanting to know if, how and by whom their data were used. Though it was not an objective of the study, realistic health AI scenarios were found to have an educational effect.\nNotwithstanding concerns and limited knowledge about AI in general, most members of the general public in six focus groups in Ontario, Canada perceived benefits from health AI and conditionally supported the use of health data for AI research.", "The successful translation of artificial intelligence (AI) applications into clinical cancer care practice requires guidance by academic cancer researchers and providers who are well poised to step into leadership roles. In this commentary, the authors describe the landscape of the deep learning-based AI innovation boom in cancer research. For progress in applied AI research to continue, 4 essential components must be present: algorithms, data, computational resources, and domain-specific expertise. Each of these components is available to researchers and providers in academic settings; in particular, cancer care domain-specific expertise in academia is superb. Three common pitfalls for deep learning research also are detailed along with a discussion of how the academic oncology research environment is well suited to guard against these challenges. In this rapidly developing field, there are few established standards, and oncology researchers and providers must educate themselves about emerging AI technology to avoid common pitfalls and ensure responsible use.", "(1) Background: We aimed to evaluate the effect of proposed \"microbiome-stabilising interventions\", i.e., breastfeeding for \u22653 months and prophylactic use of Lactobacillus acidophilus/ Bifidobacterium infantis probiotics on neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes of very-low-birthweight (VLBW) children aged 5-6 years. (2) Methods: We performed a 5-year-follow-up assessment including a strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) and an intelligence quotient (IQ) assessment using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI)-III test in preterm children previously enrolled in the German Neonatal Network (GNN). The analysis was restricted to children exposed to antenatal corticosteroids and postnatal antibiotics. (3) Results: 2467 primary school-aged children fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In multivariable linear regression models breastfeeding \u22653 months was associated with lower conduct disorders (B (95% confidence intervals (CI)): -0.25 (-0.47 to -0.03)) and inattention/hyperactivity (-0.46 (-0.81 to -0.10)) as measured by SDQ. Probiotic treatment during the neonatal period had no effect on SDQ scores or intelligence. (4) Conclusions: Prolonged breastfeeding of highly vulnerable infants may promote their mental health later in childhood, particularly by reducing risk for inattention/hyperactivity and conduct disorders. Future studies need to disentangle the underlying mechanisms during a critical time frame of development.", "To have population-level impact, interventions must be effectively implemented and sustained under real-world conditions. Few Fundamental Movement Skill (FMS) interventions are implemented at scale, and even fewer are sustained in a way that allows for ongoing evaluation. There has been increasing recognition of applying systems thinking to investigate the multitude of influences on interventions. To improve research-practice translations, investigations need to incorporate synthesised perspective and collective input from intervention stakeholders. This study trials Collective Intelligence (CI) - an applied systems science approach - to understand barriers to the adoption, implementation and institutionalisation of effective FMS interventions for children and adolescents. A total of 58 barriers were generated and organised into 13 barrier categories. Participants voted to select 10 critical barriers and generated a structural map among the barriers to guide future action mapping. Barriers related to Government and Institutional factors and Curricular Conflicts were structured as fundamental drivers of the system of barriers. By presenting this application example, we aim to underline the considerations and alleviate barriers to conducting much needed implementation and sustainability studies in FMS interventions. CI also adds to the \"tool box\" to understand the complexity and functioning of public health interventions, such as those targeting physical activity behaviours.", "This paper describes the open cohort CROSS-TRACKS, which comprises population-based data from primary care, secondary care and national registries to study patient pathways and transitions across sectors while adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics.\nA total of 221\u2009283 individuals resided in the four Danish municipalities that constituted the catchment area of Horsens Regional Hospital in 2012-2018. A total of 96% of the population used primary care, 35% received at least one transfer payment and 66% was in contact with a hospital at least once in the period. Additional clinical information is available for hospital contacts (eg, alcohol intake, smoking status, body mass index and blood pressure). A total of 23% (n=8191) of individuals aged \u226565 years had at least one potentially preventable hospital admission, and 73% (n=5941) of these individuals had more than one.\nThe cohort is currently used for research projects in epidemiology and artificial intelligence. These projects comprise a prediction model for potentially preventable hospital admissions, a clinical decision support system based on artificial intelligence, prevention of medication errors in the transition between sectors, health behaviour and sociodemographic characteristics of men and women prior to fertility treatment, and a recently published study applying machine learning methods for early detection of sepsis.\nThe CROSS-TRACKS cohort will be expanded to comprise the entire Central Denmark Region consisting of 1.3\u2009million residents. The cohort can provide new knowledge on how to best organise interventions across healthcare sectors and prevent potentially preventable hospital admissions. Such knowledge would benefit both the individual citizen and society as a whole.", "Noninvasive imaging modalities are of central importance in the diagnosis of chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) in the current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), while the role of primary invasive coronary angiography in this context is increasingly being questioned. This review provides a\u00a0summary of the most important diagnostic strategies from the radiology perspective.\nThe diagnostic algorithm is guided by the pretest probability (PTP) for the presence of CCS, which can be estimated based on age, sex, and symptoms. It is important to note that PTP in the current guidelines has decreased significantly compared to older recommendations and this change has an impact on the selection of the most appropriate imaging technique.\nIn patients with low PTP (>5% and <15%) and without prediagnosed coronary artery disease (CAD), CCS can be safely ruled out with inconspicuous computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the coronary vessels. In patients with increased PTP (>15%) or prediagnosed CAD, noninvasive functional imaging should be primarily used to detect ischemia.\nThe excellent sensitivity (89%), specificity (87%) and high prognostic relevance make stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging the functional method of first choice. Technical innovations and the use of artificial intelligence-based methods for image analysis could contribute to further improve its accuracy in the future.\nRadiologists should be aware of the recommendations of the current guidelines and work towards the establishment of coronary CTA and stress perfusion CMR in clinical routine.", "In eutrophic coastal waters, harmful algal blooms (HAB) often occur and present challenges to environmental and fisheries management. Despite decades of research on HAB early warning systems, the field validation of algal bloom forecast models have received scant attention. We propose a daily algal bloom risk forecast system based on: (i) a vertical stability theory verified against 191 past algal bloom events; and (ii) a data-driven artificial neural network (ANN) model that assimilates high frequency data to predict sea surface temperature (SST), vertical temperature and salinity differential with an accuracy of 0.35oC, 0.51oC, and 0.58\u00a0psu respectively. The model does not rely on past chlorophyll measurements and has been validated against extensive field data. Operational forecasts are illustrated for representative algal bloom events at a marine fish farm in Tolo Harbour, Hong Kong. The robust model can assist with traditional onsite monitoring as well as artificial-intelligence (AI) based methods.", "The Internet, which has spanned several networks in a broad range of domains, is having a significant impact on every aspect of our lives. The next generation of networks will utilize a wide variety of resources with significant sensing capabilities. Such networks will extend beyond physically linked computers to include multimodal-information from biological, cognitive, semantic, and social networks. This paradigm shift will involve symbiotic networks of smart medical devices, and smart phones or mobile personal computing and communication devices. These devices-and the network-will be constantly sensing, monitoring, and interpreting the environment; this is sometimes referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). We are also witnessing considerable interest in the \"Omics\" paradigm, which can be viewed as the study of a domain in a massive scale, at different levels of abstraction, in an integrative manner. The IoT revolution, combined with the Omics revolution (genomics and socio-omics or social networks) and artificial intelligence resurgence, will have significant implications for the way health care is delivered in the United States. After discussing a vision for health care in the future, we introduce the P9 health care concept, followed by a discussion of a framework for smart health care. Then, we present a case study and research directions, followed by examples of ongoing work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).", "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmias that affects the lives of many people around the world and is associated with a five-fold increased risk of stroke and mortality. Like other problems in the healthcare domain, artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have been used to detect AF from patients' ECG signals. The cardiologist level performance in detecting this arrhythmia is often achieved by deep learning-based methods, however, they suffer from the lack of interpretability. In other words, these approaches are unable to explain the reasons behind their decisions. The lack of interpretability is a common challenge toward a wide application of machine learning (ML)-based approaches in the healthcare which limits the trust of clinicians in such methods. To address this challenge, we propose HAN-ECG, an interpretable bidirectional-recurrent-neural-network-based approach for the AF detection task. The HAN-ECG employs three attention mechanism levels to provide a multi-resolution analysis of the patterns in ECG leading to AF. The detected patterns by this hierarchical attention model facilitate the interpretation of the neural network decision process in identifying the patterns in the signal which contributed the most to the final detection. Experimental results on two AF databases demonstrate that our proposed model performs better than the existing algorithms. Visualization of these attention layers illustrates that our proposed model decides upon the important waves and heartbeats which are clinically meaningful in the detection task (e.g., absence of P-waves, and irregular R-R intervals for the AF detection task).", "Diagnostic processes typically rely on traditional and laborious methods, that are prone to human error, resulting in frequent misdiagnosis of diseases. Computational approaches are being increasingly used for more precise diagnosis of the clinical pathology, diagnosis of genetic and microbial diseases, and analysis of clinical chemistry data. These approaches are progressively used for improving the reliability of testing, resulting in reduced diagnostic errors. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational approaches mostly rely on training sets obtained from patient data stored in clinical databases. However, the use of AI is associated with several ethical issues, including patient privacy and data ownership. The capacity of AI-based mathematical models to interpret complex clinical data frequently leads to data bias and reporting of erroneous results based on patient data. In order to improve the reliability of computational approaches in clinical diagnostics, strategies to reduce data bias and analyzing real-life patient data need to be further refined.", "Suspended sediment load is a substantial portion of the total sediment load in rivers and plays a vital role in determination of the service life of the downstream dam. To this end, estimation models are needed to compute suspended sediment load in rivers. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has become popular in water resources engineering for solving complex problems such as sediment transport modeling. In this study, novel integrative intelligence models coupled with iterative classifier optimizer (ICO) are proposed to compute suspended sediment load in Simga station in Seonath river basin, Chhattisgarh State, India. The proposed models are hybridization of the random forest (RF) and pace regression (PR) models with the iterative classifier optimizer (ICO) algorithm to develop ICO-RF and ICO-PR hybrid models. The recommended models are established using the discharge and sediment daily data spanning a 35-year period (1980-2015). The accuracy of the developed models is examined in terms of error; by root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE); and based on a correlation index of determination coefficient (R2). The proposed novel hybrid models of ICO-RF and ICO-PR have been found to be more precise than their stand-alone counterparts of RF and PR. Overall, ICO-RF models delivered better accuracy than their alternatives. The results of this analysis tend to claim the appropriateness of the implemented methodology for precise modeling of the suspended sediment load in rivers.", "Dyslipidemias can affect molecular networks underlying the metabolic homeostasis and vascular function leading to atherogenesis at early stages of development. Since disease-related proteins often interact with each other in functional modules, many advanced network-oriented algorithms were applied to patient-derived big data to identify the complex gene-environment interactions underlying the early pathophysiology of dyslipidemias and atherosclerosis. Both the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7 (PCSK7) and collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) genes arose from the application of TFfit and WGCNA algorithms, respectively, as potential useful therapeutic targets in prevention of dyslipidemias. Moreover, the Seed Connector algorithm (SCA) algorithm suggested a putative role of the neuropilin-1 (NRP1) protein as drug target, whereas a regression network analysis reported that niacin may provide benefits in mixed dyslipidemias. Dyslipidemias are highly heterogeneous at the clinical level; thus, it would be helpful to overcome traditional evidence-based paradigm toward a personalized risk assessment and therapy. Network Medicine uses omics data, artificial intelligence (AI), imaging tools, and clinical information to design personalized therapy of dyslipidemias and atherosclerosis. Recently, a novel non-invasive AI-derived biomarker, named Fat Attenuation Index (FAI\u2122) has been established to early detect clinical signs of atherosclerosis. Moreover, an integrated AI-radiomics approach can detect fibrosis and microvascular remodeling improving the customized risk assessment. Here, we offer a network-based roadmap ranging from novel molecular pathways to digital therapeutics which can improve personalized therapy of dyslipidemias.", "Reading List: Select Healthcare Transformation Library 2.0 represents a broad-based, annotated, general reading list for students of health care innovation. The books were drawn from the 5,000-book private home library of Ronald S. Weinstein, MD, President Emeritus of the American Telemedicine Association. Weinstein is a lifelong book collector with special interests in the history of medical innovation and poetry. A Massachusetts General Hospital-trained pathologist and inductee into the US Distance Learning Association's Hall of Fame, he is known as a pioneer in telemedicine and the \"father of telepathology\" for his invention, patenting, and commercialization of telepathology, a subspecialty of telemedicine that is a billion-dollar worldwide industry today. This Reading List: Select Healthcare Transformation Library 2.0 consists of 41 books divided into 10 sections: (1) Human Intelligence, Behavior, and Creativity; (2) Societal Revolutions; (3) Innovation; (4) Healthcare System Transformations; (5) Education; (6) Transformational Technologies-Part 1 (AI, Automation, and Robotics); (7) Transformational Technologies-Part 2 (Telemedicine and Telehealth); (8) Digital Medicine; (9) Healthcare Transformation Implementation; and (10) COVID-19 Pandemic as an Innovation Accelerator.", "Hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) models are developed for sediment lead (Pb) prediction in two Bays (i.e., Bramble (BB) and Deception (DB)) stations, Australia. A feature selection (FS) algorithm called extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is proposed to abstract the correlated input parameters for the Pb prediction and validated against principal component of analysis (PCA), recursive feature elimination (RFE), and the genetic algorithm (GA). XGBoost model is applied using a grid search strategy (Grid-XGBoost) for predicting Pb and validated against the commonly used AI models, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The input parameter selection approaches redimensioned the 21 parameters into 9-5 parameters without losing their learned information over the models' training phase. At the BB station, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values (0.06, 0.32, 0.34, and 0.33) were achieved for the XGBoost-SVM, XGBoost-ANN, XGBoost-Grid-XGBoost, and Grid-XGBoost models, respectively. At the DB station, the lowest MAPE values, 0.25 and 0.24, were attained for the XGBoost-Grid-XGBoost and Grid-XGBoost models, respectively. Overall, the proposed hybrid AI models provided a reliable and robust computer aid technology for sediment Pb prediction that contribute to the best knowledge of environmental pollution monitoring and assessment.", "Studies on autistic strengths are often focused on what they reveal about autistic intelligence and, in some cases, exceptional and atypical reasoning abilities. An emerging research trend has demonstrated how interests and strengths often evident in autism can be harnessed in interventions to promote the well-being, adaptive, academic and professional success of autistic people. However, abilities in certain domains may be accompanied by major limitations in others, as well as psychiatric and behavioral issues, which may challenge their inclusion in support programs.\nTo provide an in-depth, pragmatic, real-life example of the psychological and psychiatric management of interests and strengths in an autistic adolescent.\nAn autistic teenager, C.A., with above-average calendar calculation and musical abilities, received psychiatric, neuropsychological, and language standardized and clinical assessments, combined with a measurement of his musical and calendar calculation abilities. C.A. and his parents then received psychiatric and psychological support over a 14-month period, targeting their perceptions of C.A.'s interests, strengths, and co-occurring difficulties.\nC.A. had a verbal IQ within the intellectual disability range and a non-verbal IQ in the low mean range. Modest calendar calculation, absolute pitch, and matrix abilities coexisted with severe receptive and expressive language disorder. The discrepancy between his abilities in areas of strengths and his limitations in other domains led to anxiety, frustration, and sometimes behavioral issues. Displacing the focus from academic performance to interests, as well as promoting the use of his strengths to develop new skills independently of their short-term adaptive benefits yielded positive effects on C.A.'s self-assessment, quality of life, and behavior at follow up.\nThe appealing idea that abilities mostly found in autistic people, such as calendar calculation, can be directly harnessed into academic achievement and lead to paid employment may have detrimental effects, especially when such abilities are modest and associated with other limitations. These abilities should be primarily used to maximize well-being and quality of life, independently of their short-term adaptive function, which may or may not be positive.", "Over 100 nations signed the Minamata Convention on Mercury to control the adverse effects of mercury (Hg) emissions on human beings. A spatially explicit analysis is needed to identify the specific sources and distribution of Hg-related health impacts. This study maps China's Hg-related health impacts and global supply chain drivers (i.e., global final consumers and primary suppliers) at a high spatial resolution. Here we show significant spatial heterogeneity in hotspots of China's Hg-related health impacts. Approximately 1% of the land area holds only 40% of the Chinese population but nearly 70% of the fatal heart attack deaths in China. Moreover, approximately 3% of the land area holds nearly 60% of the population but 70% of the intelligence quotient (IQ) decrements. The distribution of hotspots of China's Hg-related health impacts and global supply chain drivers are influenced by various factors including population, economy, transportation, resources, and dietary intake habits. These spatially explicit hotspots can support more effective policies in various stages of the global supply chains and more effective international cooperation to reduce Hg-related health impacts. This can facilitate the successful implementation of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.", "This concise review aims to explore the potential for the clinical implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies for detecting glaucoma and monitoring glaucoma progression.\nNonsystematic literature review using the search combinations \"Artificial Intelligence,\" \"Deep Learning,\" \"Machine Learning,\" \"Neural Networks,\" \"Bayesian Networks,\" \"Glaucoma Diagnosis,\" and \"Glaucoma Progression.\" Information on sensitivity and specificity regarding glaucoma diagnosis and progression analysis as well as methodological details were extracted.\nNumerous AI strategies provide promising levels of specificity and sensitivity for structural (e.g. optical coherence tomography [OCT] imaging, fundus photography) and functional (visual field [VF] testing) test modalities used for the detection of glaucoma. Area under receiver operating curve (AROC) values of > 0.90 were achieved with every modality. Combining structural and functional inputs has been shown to even more improve the diagnostic ability. Regarding glaucoma progression, AI strategies can detect progression earlier than conventional methods or potentially from one single VF test.\nAI algorithms applied to fundus photographs for screening purposes may provide good results using a simple and widely accessible test. However, for patients who are likely to have glaucoma more sophisticated methods should be used including data from OCT and perimetry. Outputs may serve as an adjunct to assist clinical decision making, whereas also enhancing the efficiency, productivity, and quality of the delivery of glaucoma care. Patients with diagnosed glaucoma may benefit from future algorithms to evaluate their risk of progression. Challenges are yet to be overcome, including the external validity of AI strategies, a move from a \"black box\" toward \"explainable AI,\" and likely regulatory hurdles. However, it is clear that AI can enhance the role of specialist clinicians and will inevitably shape the future of the delivery of glaucoma care to the next generation.\nThe promising levels of diagnostic accuracy reported by AI strategies across the modalities used in clinical practice for glaucoma detection can pave the way for the development of reliable models appropriate for their translation into clinical practice. Future incorporation of AI into healthcare models may help address the current limitations of access and timely management of patients with glaucoma across the world.", "The application of artificial intelligence in medicine, particularly in relation to screening and diagnosis of disease through imaging analysis, will have a profound impact over the next decade. This communication discusses regulatory challenges that should be considered by physicians and how potential issues may be mitigated using a collaborative approach, drawing on the combined expertise of relevant stakeholders.", "Systematic reviews are increasingly prevalent in environmental health due to their ability to synthesize evidence while reducing bias. Different systematic review methods have been developed by the US National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT), the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), and by the US EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), including the approach to assess risk of bias (ROB), one of the most vital steps which is used to evaluate internal validity of the studies. Our objective was to compare the performance of three tools (OHAT, IRIS, TSCA) in assessing ROB.\nWe selected a systematic review on polybrominated diphenyl ethers and intelligence quotient and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder because it had been endorsed by the National Academy of Sciences. Two reviewers followed verbatim instructions from the tools and independently applied each tool to assess ROB in 15 studies previously identified. We documented the time to apply each tool and the\u00a0impact the\u00a0ROB ratings for each tool had on the final rating of the quality of the overall body of evidence.\nThe time to complete the ROB assessments varied widely (mean = 20, 32, and 40\u2009min per study for the OHAT, IRIS, and TSCA tools, respectively). All studies were rated overall \"low\" or \"uninformative\" using IRIS, due to \"deficient\" or \"critically deficient\" ratings in one or two domains. Similarly, all studies were rated \"unacceptable\" using the TSCA tool because of one \"unacceptable\" rating in a metric related to statistical power. Approximately half of the studies had \"low\" or \"probably low ROB\" ratings across all domains with the OHAT and Navigation Guide tools.\nTools that use overall ROB or study quality ratings, such as IRIS and TSCA, may reduce the available evidence to assess the harms of environmental exposures by erroneously excluding studies, which leads to inaccurate conclusions about the quality of the body of evidence. We recommend using ROB tools that circumvents these issues, such as OHAT and Navigation Guide.\nThis review has not been registered as it is not a systematic review.", "It is unknown whether patients admitted for all-cause dental conditions (ACDC) are at high risk for hospital readmission, or what are the risk factors for dental hospital readmission.\nWe examined the prevalence of, and risk factors associated with, 30-day hospital readmission for patients with an all-cause dental admission. We applied artificial intelligence to develop machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict patients at risk of 30-day hospital readmission.\nThis study used data extracted from the 2013 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). There were a total of 11,341 cases for all-cause index admission for dental patients admitted to the hospitals. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze patient characteristics. This study applied five techniques to build risk prediction models and to identify risk factors. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision.\nThere were 11% of patients admitted for ACDC readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge. On average, the total charge per patient was $131,004 for those with 30-day readmission (n=1254) and $69,750 for those without readmission (n=10,087). Factors significantly associated with 30-day hospital readmission included total charges, number of diagnoses, age, number of chronic conditions, length of hospital stays, number of procedures, Medicare insurance and Medicaid insurance, and severity of illness. Model performance from all methods was similar with the artificial neural network showing the highest AUC of 0.739.\nOur results demonstrate that readmission after hospitalization with ACDC is fairly common. If one-third of the 30-day readmission cases can be avoided, there is a potential annual saving of over $25 million among the twenty-one states represented in the NRD. The ML algorithms can predict hospital readmission in dental patients and should be further tested to aid the reduction of hospital readmission and enhancement of patient-centered care.", "The strength named \"social intelligence\" in the Values in Action (VIA) Classification of Character Strengths and Virtues represents emotional, personal, and social intelligences, which are considered \"hot intelligences\". This work contributed to the study of the mechanisms of influence of social intelligence on mental health. A multiple mediation model was proposed to quantify the direct effect of social intelligence on psychopathological symptoms, as well as its indirect effect through its impact on components of subjective and psychological well-being. This study involved 1407 university students who completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Psychological Well-Being Scales (PWBS), and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Social intelligence was found to be significantly associated with life satisfaction (a = 0.33, p < 0.001), positive affect (a = 0.42, p < 0.001), and negative affect (a = -0.21, p < 0.001), transmitting significant indirect effects on psychopathological symptomatology through these components of subjective well-being. Likewise, social intelligence was positively and significantly related to psychological well-being (a-paths ranged from 0.31 to 0.43, p < 0.001), exerting significant and negative indirect effects on psychological distress through the dimension of positive relations with other people. These results could be useful in order to expand the explanatory models of the influence of social intelligence on mental health and to design interventions based on this strength for the promotion of well-being and the reduction in psychological distress.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) pertains to the ability of computers or computer-controlled machines to perform activities that demand the cognitive function and performance level of the human brain. The use of AI in medicine and health care is growing rapidly, significantly impacting areas such as medical diagnostics, drug development, treatment personalization, supportive health services, genomics, and public health management. AI offers several advantages; however, its rampant rise in health care also raises concerns regarding legal liability, ethics, and data privacy. Technological singularity (TS) is a hypothetical future point in time when AI will surpass human intelligence. If it occurs, TS in health care would imply the replacement of human medical practitioners with AI-guided robots and peripheral systems. Considering the pace at which technological advances are taking place in the arena of AI, and the pace at which AI is being integrated with health care systems, it is not be unreasonable to believe that TS in health care might occur in the near future and that AI-enabled services will profoundly augment the capabilities of doctors, if not completely replace them. There is a need to understand the associated challenges so that we may better prepare the health care system and society to embrace such a change - if it happens.", "For the last few decades, toxic levels of arsenic (As) in groundwater from the aquifers of the Ganges River delta, India and Bangladesh, have been known to cause serious public health concerns. Innumerable studies have advocated the control of geomorphologic, geologic, hydrogeologic, biogeochemical, and anthropogenic factors on arsenic mobilization, flow, and distribution patterns within the Ganges River delta. We have developed transboundary regional-scale models for computing the probability of groundwater As concentrations to exceed the WHO permissible thresholds for drinking water of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L within the Ganges River delta as a function of the various geomorphologic-(hydro)geologic-hydrostratigraphic-anthropogenic controlling factors, using statistical methods and artificial intelligence (AI) [i.e., machine learning] techniques namely, Random Forest (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Logistic Regression (LR) algorithms, followed by probabilistic delineation the high As-hazard zones within the delta. A \"hybrid multi-modeling approach\" was adapted for this study, which involved the introduction of hydrostratigraphic parameters (aquifer connectivity and surficial aquitard thickness) derived from a high-resolution transboundary hydrostratigraphic model developed for the Ganges River delta aquifer system, as predictors for modeling groundwater As probabilities within the delta. The RF model outperforms the BRT and LR model in terms of model performance. Model outputs suggest the dominant influence of surficial aquitard thickness and groundwater-fed irrigated area (%) on groundwater As. While, the north-central and southern regions of the Ganges River delta show low As-hazard (<10\u00a0\u03bcg/L), the western and north-eastern regions demonstrate elevated hazard level (>10\u00a0\u03bcg/L). An estimated 30.3 million people are found to be exposed to elevated groundwater As within the study area. Thus, our study demonstrates that such hybrid, predictive models are not only helpful in delineating the regional-scale distribution of groundwater As-hazard zones in the areas with limited As data but is also useful in identifying the possible exogenous forcing that may have led to the worst, natural pollution in human history.", "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) captures retinal damage in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). Previous studies investigating OCT in NMOSD have been limited by the rareness and heterogeneity of the disease. The goal of this study was to establish an image repository platform, which will facilitate neuroimaging studies in NMOSD. Here we summarise the profile of the Collaborative OCT in NMOSD repository as the initial effort in establishing this platform. This repository should prove invaluable for studies using OCT to investigate NMOSD.\nThe current cohort includes data from 539 patients with NMOSD and 114 healthy controls. These were collected at 22 participating centres from North and South America, Asia and Europe. The dataset consists of demographic details, diagnosis, antibody status, clinical disability, visual function, history of optic neuritis and other NMOSD defining attacks, and OCT source data from three different OCT devices.\nThe cohort informs similar demographic and clinical characteristics as those of previously published NMOSD cohorts. The image repository platform and centre network continue to be available for future prospective neuroimaging studies in NMOSD. For the conduct of the study, we have refined OCT image quality criteria and developed a cross-device intraretinal segmentation pipeline.\nWe are pursuing several scientific projects based on the repository, such as analysing retinal layer thickness measurements, in this cohort in an attempt to identify differences between distinct disease phenotypes, demographics and ethnicities. The dataset will be available for further projects to interested, qualified parties, such as those using specialised image analysis or artificial intelligence applications.", "Despite considerable progress in face recognition technology in recent years, deep learning (DL) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) have revealed commendable recognition effects with the advent of artificial intelligence and big data. FaceNet was presented in 2015 and is able to significantly improve the accuracy of face recognition, while also being powerfully built to counteract several common issues, such as occlusion, blur, illumination change, and different angles of head pose. However, not all hardware can sustain the heavy computing load in the execution of the FaceNet model. In applications in the security industry, lightweight and efficient face recognition are two key points for facilitating the deployment of DL and CNN models directly in field devices, due to their limited edge computing capability and low equipment cost. To this end, this paper provides a lightweight learning network improved from FaceNet, which is called FN13, to break through the hardware limitation of constrained computational resources. The proposed FN13 takes the advantage of center loss to reduce the variations of the between-class features and enlarge the difference of the within-class features, instead of the triplet loss by using FaceNet. The resulting model reduces the number of parameters and maintains a high degree of accuracy, only requiring few grayscale reference images per subject. The validity of FN13 is demonstrated by conducting experiments on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, as well as an analytical discussion regarding specific disguise problems.", "Falls in older adults result in serious, life-limiting consequences. An increasing number of fall prevention interventions have used technology to reduce the number of falls in community-dwelling adults. Various types of e-interventions are being tested in clinical trials and in the community. These include telehealth, exergames, cognitive games, socialized training, smart home systems and non-conventional balance training. Currently, no systematic review and meta-analysis has assessed the overall effectiveness of e-interventions and compared the effectiveness of the different types.\nThe aim of this review was to synthesize best available evidence concerning the effectiveness of e-interventions on fall, neuromuscular functions and quality of life in community-dwelling older adults.\nA rigorous three-step search was conducted in nine online databases for published and unpublished randomized controlled trials studying e-interventions. Studies were screened and assessed for individual and overall risk of bias by two independent reviewers. Six fall-related outcomes were evaluated in the meta-analysis: fall risk, balance, lower extremity strength, fall efficacy, cognitive function and health-related quality of life. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were conducted during meta-analysis.\nThirty-one studies fit the eligibility criteria and had an overall 74.7% low risk of bias. A total of 4,877 older adults from 17 countries were included in narrative synthesis and meta-analysis. Telehealth combined with exercise programmes and smart home systems were able to reduce fall risk significantly (risk ratio=0.79, 95% CI [0.72, 0.86]). E-interventions also significantly improved balance and fall efficacy (standardized mean difference=0.28, 95% CI [0.04, 0.53]). However, lower extremity strength, cognitive function and health-related quality of life did not show significant improvements.\nTelehealth combined with exercise and smart home systems demonstrated the best evidence of effectiveness in reduction of falls in community-dwelling older adults. Future research should focus on forecasting falls using smart home technology and Artificial Intelligence, and testing promising e-interventions on larger samples to improve the strength of evidence of fall prevention by e-interventions.", "Osteoarthritis (OA) has primarily been diagnosed with plain radiographs assessed visually by examiners with regard to joint space width and presence of subchondral sclerosis, cysts and osteophytes. The increasing use of artificial intelligence has seen software developed to examine plain radiographs for diagnosing OA, based on observed OA-associated subchondral bone microarchitecture changes. A software for computerized texture analysis has been developed to identify knee OA. The aim of this study was to assess the software's ability to identify radiocarpal OA.\nPresence of radiocarpal OA on 63 wrist radiographs of patients with a previous distal radius fracture was assessed independently by two surgeons experienced in assessing radiographs, and classified according to Kellgren-Lawrence (38 OA, 25 no OA). First, the computer software, not previously trained to identify wrist OA, assessed presence of radiocarpal OA on the 63 radiographs. In a second step, 144 labeled wrist radiographs with and without radiocarpal OA was used to train the computer software. Presence of OA on the original 63 radiographs were then reassessed by the software. Sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to determine the software's ability to discriminate between cases with and without OA.\nBefore training, sensitivity was 76% (95% CI 59-88), specificity 25% (10-47), and AUC 0.50 (0.35-0.65). After training, sensitivity was 46% (29-63), specificity 70% (47-87), and AUC 0.58 (0.43-0.73).\nThe software for computerized texture analysis of subchondral bone developed to identify knee OA could not detect OA of the radiocarpal joint.", "Artificial intelligence-based technology systems offer an alternative solution for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening compared with standard, in-office dilated eye examinations. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of Automated Retinal Image Analysis System (ARIAS)-based DR screening in a primary care medicine clinic that serves a low-income patient population.\nA model-based, cost-effectiveness analysis of two DR screening systems was created utilizing data from a recent study comparing adherence rates to follow-up eye care among adults ages 18 or older with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes. In the study, the patients were prescreened with an ARIAS-based, nonmydriatic (undilated), point-of-care tool in the primary care setting and were compared with patients with diabetes who were referred for dilated retinal screening without prescreening, as is the current standard of care. Using a Markov model with microsimulation resulting in a total of 600 000 simulated patient experiences, we calculated the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of the two screening approaches, with regard to five-year cost-effectiveness of DR screening and treatment of vision-threatening DR.\nAt five years, ARIAS-based screening showed similar utility as the standard of care screening systems. However, ARIAS reduced costs by 23.3%, with an ICUR of $258 721.81 comparing the current practice to ARIAS.\nPrimary care-based ARIAS DR screening is cost-effective when compared with standard of care screening methods.", "Digital health is transforming the delivery of health care around the world to meet the growing challenges presented by ageing populations with multiple chronic conditions. Digital health technologies can support the delivery of personalised nutrition care through the standardised Nutrition Care Process (NCP) by using personal data and technology-supported delivery modalities. The digital disruption of traditional dietetic services is occurring worldwide, supporting responsive and high-quality nutrition care. These disruptive technologies include integrated electronic and personal health records, mobile apps, wearables, artificial intelligence and machine learning, conversation agents, chatbots, and social robots. Here, we outline how digital health is disrupting the traditional model of nutrition care delivery and outline the potential for dietitians to not only embrace digital disruption, but also take ownership in shaping it, aiming to enhance patient care. An overview is provided of digital health concepts and disruptive technologies according to the four steps in the NCP: nutrition assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring and evaluation. It is imperative that dietitians stay abreast of these technological developments and be the leaders of the disruption, not simply subject to it. By doing so, dietitians now, as well as in the future, will maximise their impact and continue to champion evidence-based nutrition practice.", "Endoscopy is the optimal choice of diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Following the advancements made in medical technology, different kinds of novel endoscopy-methods have emerged. Although the significant progress in the penetration of endoscopic tools that have markedly improved the diagnostic rate of GI diseases, there are still some limitations, including instability of human diagnostic performance caused by intensive labor burden and high missed diagnosis rate of subtle lesions. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied gradually to assist endoscopists in addressing these issues.\nIn this study, we provide an overview of the application of the AI technology in the field of endoscopy, as well as its current limitations and prospects. The result suggested that AI had a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy compared with human endoscopists in the diagnosis of GI diseases. With the help of AI technology, the diagnostic performances of nonexpert endoscopists had been improved considerably.\nAI technology still has several limitations, and there are still plenty of opportunities for improvement.", "Several evolution strategies for in vivo computation are proposed with the aim of realizing tumor sensitization and targeting (TST) by externally manipulable nanoswimmers. In such targeting systems, nanoswimmers assembled by magnetic nanoparticles are externally manipulated to search for the tumor in the high-risk tissue by a rotating magnetic field produced by a coil system. This process can be interpreted as in vivo computation, where the tumor in the high-risk tissue corresponds to the global maximum or minimum of the in vivo optimization problem, the nanoswimmers are seen as the computational agents, the tumor-triggered biological gradient field (BGF) is used for fitness evaluation of the agents, and the high-risk tissue is the search space. Considering that the state-of-the-art magnetic nanoswimmer control method can only actuate all the nanoswimmers heading in the same direction simultaneously, we introduce the orthokinetic movement strategies into the agent location updating in the existing swarm intelligence algorithms. Especially, the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is revisited and the corresponding in vivo optimization algorithm called orthokinetic GSA (OGSA) is proposed to carry out the TST. Furthermore, to determine the direction of the orthokinetic agent movement in every iteration of the operation, we propose several strategies according to the fitness ranking of the nanoswimmers in the BGF. To verify the superiority of the OGSA and choose the optimal evolution strategy, some numerical experiments are presented and compared with that of the brute-force search, which represents the traditional method for TST. It is found that the TST performance can be improved by the weak priority evolution strategy (WP-ES) in most of the scenarios.", "In order to improve the reconstruction accuracy of magnetic induction tomography (MIT) and achieve fast imaging especially in the detection of cerebral hemorrhage, artificial intelligence algorithms are proposed to improve the accuracy of MIT inverse problem.\nAccording to the standard geometric data of human head, a three-dimensional (3D) head model containing four layer tissues is established for brain image reconstruction of MIT. Four deep learning (DL) networks, including restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), deep belief network (DBN), stacked autoencoder (SAE), and denoising autoencoder (DAE), are used to solve the nonlinear reconstruction problem of MIT, and the reconstruction results of DL networks and back-projection algorithm are compared. Finally, in order to verify the practical value of DL algorithms, the phantom experiment is carried out with MIT detection system.\nUsing the nonlinear data learning ability of DL algorithms, the rapid and high-precision imaging of cerebral hemorrhage can be realized. Compared with the back-projection algorithm, the DL improves the artifact and the accuracy of the reconstruction image. The location and volume of bleeding can be reconstructed and the prediction time reaches 20\u00a0ms. Moreover, the anti-noise performance of the networks can reach 20\u00a0dB.\nThe DL can effectively improve the reconstruction accuracy and prediction speed of the image when it is applied to the reconstruction of cerebral hemorrhage in MIT. This feasibility study MIT to be a potential technology for brain diseases to fully meet the needs of accurate, rapid, and low-cost clinical diagnosis and continuous monitoring.", "In this issue of Clinical Kidney Journal, Park et al. presents the results of a nationwide population-based trial that included >5000 dialysis patients receiving a drug-eluting stent (DES). The main objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and the safety of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). The primary outcome was a composite of mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and stroke, significantly lowered by a longer DAPT regimen at 12, 15 and 18\u2009months, respectively. Longer DAPT tended to be correlated with higher bleeding events at all landmarks, with no statistical significance. An important element was that almost 75% of the index events were acute coronary syndromes. This study presents the first solid evidence for a significant benefit of prolonged DAPT in dialysis patients receiving a DES. We believe that end-stage renal disease is still in the middle of a rope game, being pulled to one side or another by other features, inclining towards a higher bleeding risk or towards higher ischaemic risk. The acute versus elective presentation seems to weigh in choosing the antiplatelet regimen. The 'one-size-fits-all strategy' is not suitable for this particular group. Probably in the future, practitioners will be provided with decision pathways generated by artificial intelligence algorithms yielding 'truly individualized' DAPT protocols for every single patient.", "Improving road safety through artificial intelligence-based systems is now crucial turning smart cities into a reality. Under this highly relevant and extensive heading, an approach is proposed to improve vehicle detection in smart crosswalks using machine learning models. Contrarily to classic fuzzy classifiers, machine learning models do not require the readjustment of labels that depend on the location of the system and the road conditions. Several machine learning models were trained and tested using real traffic data taken from urban scenarios in both Portugal and Spain. These include random forest, time-series forecasting, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine, and logistic regression models. A deep reinforcement learning agent, based on a state-of-the-art double-deep recurrent Q-network, is also designed and compared with the machine learning models just mentioned. Results show that the machine learning models can efficiently replace the classic fuzzy classifier.", "The ability to predict material properties without the need for resource-consuming experimental efforts can immensely accelerate material and drug discovery. Although ab initio methods can be reliable and accurate in making such predictions, they are computationally too expensive on a large scale. The recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as the availability of large quantum mechanics derived datasets enable us to train models on these datasets as a benchmark and to make fast predictions on much larger datasets. The success of these machine learning models highly depends on the machine-readable fingerprints of the molecules that capture their chemical properties as well as topological information. In this work, we propose a common deep learning-based framework to combine different types of molecular fingerprints to enhance prediction accuracy. A graph neural network (GNN), many-body tensor representation (MBTR), and a set of simple molecular descriptors (MD) were used to predict the total energies, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of a dataset containing \u223c62k large organic molecules with complex aromatic rings and remarkably diverse functional groups. The results demonstrate that a combination of best performing molecular fingerprints can produce better results than the individual ones. The simple and flexible deep learning framework developed in this work can be easily adapted to incorporate other types of molecular fingerprints.", "Teleneurology has provided access to neurological expertise and state-of-the-art stroke care where previously they have been inaccessible. The use of Artificial Intelligence with machine learning to assist telestroke care can be revolutionary. This includes more rapid and more reliable diagnosis through imaging analysis as well as prediction of hospital course and 3-month prognosis. Intelligent Electronic Medical Records can search free text and provide decision assistance by analyzing patient charts. Speech recognition has advanced enough to be reliable and highly convenient. Smart contextually aware communication and alert programs can enhance efficiency of patient flow and improve outcomes. Automated data collection and analysis can make quality improvement and research projects quicker and much less burdensome. Despite current challenges, these synergistic technologies hold immense promise in enhancing the clinician experience, helping to reduce physician burnout while improving patient health outcomes at a lower cost. This brief overview discusses the multifaceted potential of AI use in telestroke.", "Computer-assisted detection (CAD) systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) using convolutional neural network (CNN) have been successfully used for the diagnosis of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in experimental situations. However, it is yet unclear whether CAD systems can detect cerebral aneurysms effectively in real-life clinical situations. This paper describes the diagnostic efficacy of CAD systems for cerebral aneurysms and the types of cerebral aneurysms that they can detect.\nFrom March 7, 2017 to August 26, 2018 we performed brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for 1623 subjects, to rule out intracranial diseases. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records including the history and images for each patient.\nAmong them, we encountered 5 cases in whom the cerebral aneurysms had been overlooked in the first and second round of imaging, and were detected for the first time by CAD. All missed aneurysms were less than 2\u200amm in diameter. Of the 5 aneurysms, 2 were internal carotid artery (ICA) paraclinoid aneurysms, 2 were Internal carotid-posterior communicating artery (IC-PC) aneurysms and 1 was a distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm.\nOur CAD system can detect very small aneurysms masked by the surrounding arteries and difficult for radiologists to detect. In the future, CAD systems might pave the way to substitute the workload of diagnostic radiologists and reduce the cost of human labor.", "Exploring the interactions between the immune system and nanomaterials (NMs) is critical for designing effective and safe NMs, but large knowledge gaps remain to be filled prior to clinical applications (e.g., immunotherapy). The lack of databases on interactions between the immune system and NMs affects the discovery of new NMs for immunotherapy. Complement activation and inhibition by NMs have been widely studied, but the general rules remain unclear. Biomimetic nanocoating to promote the clearance of NMs by the immune system is an alternative strategy for the immune response mediation of the biological corona. Immune response predictions based on NM properties can facilitate the design of NMs for immunotherapy, and artificial intelligences deserve much attention in the field. This review addresses the knowledge gaps regarding immune response and immunotherapy in relation to NMs, effective immunotherapy and material design without adverse immune responses.", "Are intelligence and creativity distinct abilities, or do they rely on the same cognitive and neural systems? We sought to quantify the extent to which intelligence and creative cognition overlap in brain and behavior by combining machine learning of fMRI data and latent variable modeling of cognitive ability data in a sample of young adults (N = 186) who completed a battery of intelligence and creative thinking tasks. The study had 3 analytic goals: (a) to assess contributions of specific facets of intelligence (e.g., fluid and crystallized intelligence) and general intelligence to creative ability (i.e., divergent thinking originality), (b) to model whole-brain functional connectivity networks that predict intelligence facets and creative ability, and (c) to quantify the degree to which these predictive networks overlap in the brain. Using structural equation modeling, we found moderate to large correlations between intelligence facets and creative ability, as well as a large correlation between general intelligence and creative ability (r = .63). Using connectome-based predictive modeling, we found that functional brain networks that predict intelligence facets overlap to varying degrees with a network that predicts creative ability, particularly within the prefrontal cortex of the executive control network. Notably, a network that predicted general intelligence shared 46% of its functional connections with a network that predicted creative ability-including connections linking executive control and salience/ventral attention networks-suggesting that intelligence and creative thinking rely on similar neural and cognitive systems.

This study aimed to assess the relationship between inattention and aggressive behavior and the effect of working memory on the relationship between inattention and aggressive behavior in children and adolescents with ADHD.\nThirty-one children and 26 adolescents with ADHD were retrospectively investigated. The subjects completed the Korean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (KWISC-IV), the Korean Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL), and the Korean Children's Depression Inventory (CDI).\nInattention was positively correlated with aggressive behavior in children and adolescents with ADHD and working memory showed an insignificant correlation. However, working memory had a significant moderating effect on aggressive behavior by interacting with inattention. The moderating effect of working memory manifested when the working memory index score on the K-WISC-IV was 73.5 points or higher, and it had a significant effect on aggressive behavior.\nThis study shows that the severity of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity should be addressed to provide appropriate treatment to children and adolescents with ADHD who exhibit aggressive behavior.", "MR imaging (MRI) is now part of the standard work up of patients with rectal cancer. Restaging MRI has been traditionally used to plan the surgical approach. Its role has recently increased and been adopted as a valuable tool to assist the clinical selection of clinical (near) complete responders for organ preserving treatment. Recently several studies have addressed new imaging biomarkers that combined with morphological provides a comprehensive picture of the tumor. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has entered the clinics and proven useful for response assessment after chemoradiotherapy. Other functional (quantitative) MRI technologies are on the horizon including artificial intelligence modeling. This narrative review provides an overview of recent advances in rectal cancer (re)staging by imaging with a specific focus on response prediction and evaluation of neoadjuvant treatment response. Furthermore, directions are given for future research.", "Deep learning is the fastest growing field in artificial intelligence and has led to many transformative innovations in various domains. However, lack of interpretability sometimes hinders its application in hypothesis-driven domains such as biology and healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model with individual feature ranking. Several simulated datasets with the scenarios that contributing features are correlated and buried among non-contributing features were used to characterize the novel analysis approach. A publicly available clinical dataset was also applied. The performance of the individual level dropout feature ranking model was compared with commonly used artificial neural network model, random forest model, and population level dropout feature ranking model. The individual level dropout feature ranking model provides a reasonable prediction of the outcomes. Unlike the random forest model and population level dropout feature ranking model, which can only identify global-wise contributing features (i.e., at population level), the individual level dropout feature ranking model allows further identification of impactful features on response at individual level. Therefore, it provides a basis for clustering patients into subgroups. This may provide a new tool for enriching patients in clinical drug development and developing personalized or individualized medicine.", "Imbalances in approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) decision-making (e.g., sacrificing rewards to avoid negative outcomes) are considered central to multiple psychiatric disorders. We used computational modelling to examine 2 factors that are often not distinguished in descriptive analyses of AAC: decision uncertainty and sensitivity to negative outcomes versus rewards (emotional conflict).\nA previously validated AAC task was completed by 478 participants, including healthy controls (n = 59), people with substance use disorders (n = 159) and people with depression and/or anxiety disorders who did not have substance use disorders (n = 260). Using an active inference model, we estimated individual-level values for a model parameter that reflected decision uncertainty and another that reflected emotional conflict. We also repeated analyses in a subsample (59 healthy controls, 161 people with depression and/or anxiety disorders, 56 people with substance use disorders) that was propensity-matched for age and general intelligence.\nThe model showed high accuracy (72%). As further validation, parameters correlated with reaction times and self-reported task motivations in expected directions. The emotional conflict parameter further correlated with self-reported anxiety during the task (r = 0.32, p < 0.001), and the decision uncertainty parameter correlated with self-reported difficulty making decisions (r = 0.45, p < 0.001). Compared to healthy controls, people with depression and/or anxiety disorders and people with substance use disorders showed higher decision uncertainty in the propensity-matched sample (t = 2.16, p = 0.03, and t = 2.88, p = 0.005, respectively), with analogous results in the full sample; people with substance use disorders also showed lower emotional conflict in the full sample (t = 3.17, p = 0.002).\nThis study was limited by heterogeneity of the clinical sample and an inability to examine learning.\nThese results suggest that reduced confidence in how to act, rather than increased emotional conflict, may explain maladaptive approach-avoidance behaviours in people with psychiatric disorders.", "Surgery is considered a cornerstone of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment. In the last years, robotic surgery has seen an increase in adoption rates for both benign and malignant diseases.\nThis work aims to review the current applications of robotic surgery in IBD.\nMinimally-invasive techniques have been applied to the treatment of IBD for more than 20 years. Investments in surgical digital and robotic platforms are increasingly arising, with an estimate of getting doubled within the next 5 years. Robotic surgery represents the newest technology available to reduce the impact of surgery on patients affected by IBD, and may theoretically be even more effective than other minimally-invasive techniques given the lower rate of conversion to open surgery as compared to laparoscopy according to many large retrospective series. Data on robotic surgery applied to IBD are still scarce and initial experiences in high-volume centers from retrospective series suggested that robotic surgery may achieve similar results when compared to laparoscopy. A new wave of robotics incorporating artificial intelligence is awaited to empower the capability of IBD surgeon in terms of intraoperative decision-making beyond technical skill enhancement.", "Uncovering patients' biases toward characteristics of anesthesiologists may inform ways to improve the patient-anesthesiologist relationship. The authors previously demonstrated that patients prefer anesthesiologists displaying confident body language, but did not detect a sex bias. The effect of anesthesiologists' age on patient perceptions has not been studied. In this follow-up study, it was hypothesized that patients would prefer older-appearing anesthesiologists over younger-appearing anesthesiologists and male over female anesthesiologists.\nThree hundred adult, English-speaking patients were recruited in the Preanesthesia Evaluation and Testing Center. Patients were randomized (150 per group) to view a set of four videos in random order. Each 90-s video featured an older female, older male, younger female, or younger male anesthesiologist reciting the same script describing general anesthesia. Patients ranked each anesthesiologist on confidence, intelligence, and likelihood of choosing the anesthesiologist to care for their family member. Patients also chose the one anesthesiologist who seemed most like a leader.\nThree hundred patients watched the videos and completed the questionnaire. Among patients younger than age 65 yr, the older anesthesiologists had greater odds of being ranked more confident (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.41 to 2.64; P < 0.001) and more intelligent (odds ratio, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.11; P < 0.001), and had greater odds of being considered a leader (odds ratio, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.72 to 4.00; P < 0.001) when compared with younger anesthesiologists. The preference for older anesthesiologists was not observed in patients age 65 and older. Female anesthesiologists had greater odds of being ranked more confident (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.87; P = 0.003) and more likely to be chosen to care for one's family member (odds ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.40 to 2.31; P < 0.001) compared with male anesthesiologists. The ranking preference for female anesthesiologists on these two measures was observed among white patients and not among nonwhite patients.\nPatients preferred older anesthesiologists on the measures of confidence, intelligence, and leadership. Patients also preferred female anesthesiologists on the measures of confidence and likelihood of choosing the anesthesiologist to care for one's family member.", "We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of radiation interruptions at different times on the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Totally, 4510 patients were identified from a well-established big-data intelligence platform. Optimal interruption thresholds were identified using Recursive partitioning analyses. Actuarial rates were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared using the log-rank test. Patients with preceding interruptions \u22651\u00a0d (5-year OS, 89.6% vs. 85.7%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; 5-year DFS, 81.4% vs. 76.4%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), or latter interruptions \u22654\u00a0d (88.4% vs. 82.3%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; 79.2% vs. 75.1%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) showed significant detrimental effects on OS and DFS than patients without those interruptions. However, no significant lower survival was identified in latter interruptions \u22651\u00a0d (5-year OS: 89.0% vs. 86.7%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.053; 5-year DFS, 80.2% vs. 77.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.080). Latter interruptions \u22654\u00a0d was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS (HR, 1.404; 95% CI, 1.143-1.723, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and DFS (HR, 1.351; 95% CI, 1.105-1.652, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) in multivariate analysis. Radiation interruptions longer than 3\u00a0days that occurred in the latter period of treatment with IMRT were independent factors in poorer survival. Efforts are needed to minimize radiation interruptions and improve the timely provision of treatment.", "The benefits attributed to emotional intelligence (EI) in a school environment can be observed in areas such as interpersonal relationships, psychological well-being, academic performance, and avoidance of disruptive behaviors. The objective of this study was to analyze a sample of 3451 adolescents from a secondary school to test whether EI is a protector against cybervictimization and the repercussions of cybervictimization, and whether EI has an influence on academic performance. The instruments used in the study included a questionnaire of risk factors for cybervictimization-the Trait Meta Mood Scale 24 (Spanish version)-and the global marks or academic performance of the students. The relationships between the variables were analyzed and a structural equation model was developed. The correlations revealed that there was a positive relationship between EI and student academic performance, but there was also a negative relationship regarding cybervictimization. In other words, students with lower EI were more likely to suffer from cybervictimization and could experience negative repercussions on school success. Through EI training and addressing disruptive behaviors by focusing on school climate, classroom management, and discipline, we can create emotional regulation guidelines among students to eradicate disruptive behaviors.", "This issue of the Biomedical Journal acquaints us with the compelling hypothesis that the vascular glycocalyx lies at the intersection of severe COVID-19 risk factors and damages, and the ways used by artificial intelligence to predict interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Furthermore, we explore the antiviral potential of valinomycin and the long list of COVID-19-related clinical trials, and learn how (not) to fix a broken femoral head. Last but not least, we get to enjoy the tale of the cellular oxygen-sensing system as well as the role of the host complement system during Leptospira infection, and learn that SARS-CoV-2 can sometimes come with a pathogenic plus one.", "A recent experiment proves the therapeutic effect of arm-in-arm walking, showing that if an aged participant walks in close synchrony with a young companion, the complexity matching effect results in the restoration of complexity in the former. A clear manifestation of complexity restoration is a perfect synchronization. The authors of this interesting experiment leave open two important problems. The first is the measure of complexity that is interpreted as a degree of multifractality. The second problem is the lack of a theoretical derivation of synchronization, which is experimentally observed with no theoretical derivation. The main goal of this paper is to establish a physiological foundation of these important results based on the recent advances on the dynamics of the brain, interpreted as a system at criticality. Criticality is a phenomenon requiring the cooperative interaction of units, the neurons of the brain, and is hypothesized as the main source of cognition. Using the criticality-induced intelligence, we define complexity as a property of crucial events, a form of temporal complexity, and we prove that the perfect synchronization is due to the interaction between the two systems, with the more complex system restoring the temporal complexity of the less complex system. The phenomenon of temporal complexity is characterized by ergodicity breaking that has made it difficult in the past to derive the perfect synchronization generated by complexity matching. For this reason, we supplement the main result of this paper with a comparison between complexity matching and complexity management.", "Fuzzy associative classifiers (FACs) have recently received considerable attention in the data mining community due to their ability to address the imprecision and graduality of truth. Similar to their more traditional statistical peers, these classifiers, however, have remained largely data driven, not leveraging human knowledge to their advantage. This is while human expert opinion and intuition should be a unique vantage point for such systems. We introduce here, for the first time, a human-centered framework (FLeAC) for FACs based on extended fuzzy logic and f -transformation that uses experts' opinions and preferences along with statistical data to solve subjective real-world problems. In FLeAC, experts take part in both constructing and reasoning of the classifier by assigning linguistic validity to each item. These validities are then aggregated using collective intelligence that determines final item validity. To examine the proposed framework, we extend an efficient and well-known FAC, CFAR, and present an extended f -CFAR algorithm. Also, several variations of f -CFAR are implemented to examine the effect of rule validity and different f -transformation operators. We then run various nonparametric statistical tests, including Friedman, Nemenyi posthoc, and ROC tests on an actual medical dataset of burn patients from Ahwaz, Iran, to compare f -CFAR performance with those of the original and nine other rule-based classifiers. Statistical analysis shows that f -CFAR not only has a better overall diagnostic performance than CFAR but also it outperforms CFAR and the other rule-based classifiers in terms of the number of rules, the number of conditions, and the execution time, leading to a more compact and comprehensible classifier with comparable accuracy.", "Recent news of Catholic and secular healthcare systems sharing electronic health record (EHR) data with technology companies for the purposes of developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications has drawn attention to the ethical and social challenges of such collaborations, including threats to patient privacy and confidentiality, undermining of patient consent, and lack of corporate transparency. Although the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops' Ethical and Religious Directives for Health Care Services (ERDs) address collaborations between US Catholic healthcare providers and other entities, the ERDs do not adequately address the novel concerns seen in EHR data-sharing for AI development. Neither does the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rule. This article describes ethical and social problems observed in recent patient data-sharing collaborations with AI companies and analyzes them in light of the guiding principles of the ERDs as well as the 2020 Rome Call to AI Ethics (RCAIE) document recently released by the Vatican. While both the ERDs and RCAIE guiding principles can inform future collaborations, we suggest that the next revision of the ERDs should consider addressing data-sharing and AI more directly.\nElectronic health record data-sharing with artificial intelligence developers presents unique ethical and social challenges that can be addressed with updated United States Catholic Conference of Bishops' Ethical and Religious Directives and guidance from the Vatican's 2020 Rome Call to AI Ethics.", "To date, no targeted therapy has been approved for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), suggesting that comprehensive understanding of genomic changes turns out to be an urgent need to break through the calm of currently known therapies of NPC.\nWhole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for 14 NPC patients, including 6 NPC-IIA cases, 8 NPC-IIB cases. The cancer chip expression data named GSE12452 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of each subtype were obtained using the Lima R package. Then gene ontology (GO) function enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed. Finally 7 potentially subtype relevant genes (PSRGs)1 were obtained.\nIn total, 37 clinically relevant mutations (CRMs)2 were obtained from WES. The 2 NPC subtypes exhibited different mutational landscapes, indicating that different NPC subtypes harbor different CRMs. Notably, we discovered that mutations of CCND1 and FGF family appeared simultaneously in 3 NPC-IIB cases, but 0 in NPC-IIA. In addition, 1395 DEGs were identified from GSE12452. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway showed significant enrichment in both the pathway distribution of CRMs and KEGG analysis of DEGs, suggesting that it is a key pathway in the development of NPC. Through PPI analysis of genes involved in the PI3K-Akt pathways and expression significance analysis of DEGs co-expressed by the 2 subtypes, 54 genes finally were screened for expression significance analysis. The GSEA analysis between patients with high and low expression of 11 candidate genes were performed. As a result, 7 PSRGs were selected, including COL4A1, ASB9, RDH10, TNFRSF21, BACE2, EVA1C and LHX2.\nThese results indicate that different NPC subtypes have different genetic changes, suggesting that they may be potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of NPC, and ultimately point to new strategies for intelligence.", "In recent times, a phishing attack has become one of the most prominent attacks faced by internet users, governments, and service-providing organizations. In a phishing attack, the attacker(s) collects the client's sensitive data (i.e., user account login details, credit/debit card numbers, etc.) by using spoofed emails or fake websites. Phishing websites are common entry points of online social engineering attacks, including numerous frauds on the websites. In such types of attacks, the attacker(s) create website pages by copying the behavior of legitimate websites and sends URL(s) to the targeted victims through spam messages, texts, or social networking. To provide a thorough understanding of phishing attack(s), this paper provides a literature review of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Hybrid Learning, and Scenario-based techniques for phishing attack detection. This paper also presents the comparison of different studies detecting the phishing attack for each AI technique and examines the qualities and shortcomings of these methodologies. Furthermore, this paper provides a comprehensive set of current challenges of phishing attacks and future research direction in this domain.", "To construct structural equation models to test the mediating role of emotional intelligence in the relationship between mindfulness and occupational burnout.\nReports assessing the relationships among mindfulness, emotional intelligence and burnout, specifically in ICU nurses, are scarce.\nThis was a descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional research design with 883 ICU nurses enrolled by convenience sampling from 29 ICUs in seven tertiary hospitals in urban areas of Chengdu, China. Mediation analysis was performed by structural equation modelling. Indirect effects were evaluated through bootstrapping.\nThe associations among mindfulness, emotional intelligence, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal accomplishment were all significant (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In the mediation models, emotional intelligence partially mediates the relationships between mindfulness and emotional exhaustion (indirect effect 0.118, p\u00a0=\u00a0.006; direct effect -0.374, p\u00a0=\u00a0.010; total effect -0.492, p\u00a0=\u00a0.011) and between mindfulness and depersonalization (indirect effect -0.182, p\u00a0=\u00a0.006; direct effect -0.452, p\u00a0=\u00a0.015; total effect -0.633, p\u00a0=\u00a0.018). Emotional intelligence plays a total mediating role between mindfulness and personal accomplishment (indirect effect 0.293, p\u00a0=\u00a0.004; direct effect 0.119, p\u00a0=\u00a0.053).\nThe results suggest that nursing manager could implement mindfulness training to improve occupational burnout in ICU nurses.\nNursing managers could help create a more favourable working environment by providing mindfulness training. Such mindfulness training could help improve nursing quality, reduce errors and ensure patient safety, possibly improving patient prognosis and probably satisfaction.", "To evaluate cognitive function in adult patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and associated factors.\nWe performed a cross-sectional observational study of adult patients with JIA and a healthy control group (no inflammatory diseases) matched for age, gender, and educational level. Cognitive function was assessed using Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III. The cognitive domains measured were attention/concentration, verbal function, visuospatial organization, working memory, and problem solving (Similarities). Other measures included clinical-epidemiological characteristics, comorbid conditions, and treatment. We performed a descriptive bivariate analysis and logistic regression to identify factors associated with visuospatial involvement.\nThe study population comprised 104 subjects (52 with JIA and 52 healthy controls). Patients with JIA had poorer results for visuospatial function, with a lower median scaled score on the Block Design test (5.0 [4.0-8.0] vs 8.0 [5.0-10.0]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.014). The number of patients with scaled scores below the average range (<8) in visuospatial organization was significantly greater in the JIA group (67.3% vs 40.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.006). The multivariate analysis revealed time since diagnosis (odds ratio [95% CI], 1.03 [1.01-1.06]), inflammatory activity according to Juvenile Arthritis\u00a0Disease Activity Score 27-joint count (1.94 [1.01-3.75]), and educational level (0.28 [0.08-0.94]) to be factors associated with visuospatial function.\nCognitive function in adult patients with JIA is poorer than in healthy controls at the expense of visuospatial function. Visuospatial function in JIA patients was inversely associated with disease duration, inflammatory activity, and lower educational level.", "The ability to mentalize, namely to understand, interpret and effectively communicate the mental state of self and others is considered important in self-organisation and affect regulation. The aim of the present study was to provide data on the validation process of Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (RFQ), a recently developed measure of mentalizing, in order to evaluate its use in research and in clinical practice for Greek populations. A total of 219 participants (102 people with type 1 diabetes and 117 healthy individuals) completed the RFQ. A principal component analysis supported the 2-factor model (RF certainty for mental states and RF uncertainty for mental states) in both samples. Internal consistencies of both subscales were satisfactory (\u03b1=0.80 for RF certainty and \u03b1=0.79 for RF uncertainty). Relationships with validity measures of psychological distress, empathy and emotional intelligence provided further support for the psychometric properties of the scale. As expected, there were positive associations between the degree of certainty concerning mental states and emotional intelligence (r=0.390, p<0.01), as well as empathy (r=0.292, p<0.01) in general population. Conversely, negative associations were found between the degree of certainty about mental states and psychological distress in the diabetes group (r=-0.470, p<0.01) and in general population (r=0.320, p<0.01). A reverse pattern of associations was observed between the degree of uncertainty about mental states and emotional intelligence (r=-0.265, p<0.01) in general population, as well as psychological distress in both the diabetes group (r=0.590, p<0.01) and in general population (r=0.330, p<0.01). Also, as expected, there were differences across age groups, with older participants reporting a more balanced reflective functioning - with higher certainty levels in the diabetes group (t=-2.133, p>0.05) and the healthy participants (t=-2.738, p>0.05) and lower uncertainty levels in the diabetes group (t=-2.480, p>0.05) and the healthy participants (t=-2.779, p>0.05). The data collected so far support the reliability and validity of the measure that can be used in research to address mentalizing impairments. However, further research is needed to evaluate its consistency thought time with a test-retest analysis, and to evidence its factorial structure with a confirmatory factor analysis. In addition, it is of primary importance to extend the validity testing of RFQ in clinical populations to further support its use in clinical practice.", "This research examines how artificial intelligence may contribute to better understanding and to overcome over-indebtedness in contexts of high poverty risk. This research uses Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) in a field database of 1654 over-indebted households to identify distinguishable clusters and to predict its risk factors. First, unsupervised machine learning using Self-Organizing Maps generated three over-indebtedness clusters: low-income (31.27%), low credit control (37.40%), and crisis-affected households (31.33%). Second, supervised machine learning with exhaustive grid search hyperparameters (32,730 predictive models) suggests that Nu-Support Vector Machine had the best accuracy in predicting families' over-indebtedness risk factors (89.5%). By proposing an AutoML approach on over-indebtedness, our research adds both theoretically and methodologically to current models of scarcity with important practical implications for business research and society. Our findings also contribute to novel ways to identify and characterize poverty risk in earlier stages, allowing customized interventions for different profiles of over-indebtedness.", "Bone age is one of biological indicators of maturity used in clinical practice and it is a very important parameter of a child\u2019s assessment, especially in paediatric endocrinology. The most widely used method of bone age assessment is by performing a hand and wrist radiograph and its analysis with Greulich-Pyle or Tanner-Whitehouse atlases, although it has been about 60 years since they were published. Due to the progress in the area of Computer-Aided Diagnosis and application of artificial intelligence in medicine, lately, numerous programs for automatic bone age assessment have been created. Most of them have been verified in clinical studies in comparison to traditional methods, showing good precision while eliminating inter- and intra-rater variability and significantly reducing the time of assessment. Additionally, there are available methods for assessment of bone age which avoid X-ray exposure, using modalities such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging.", "In recent years, technological advancements have made a promising impact on the development of autonomous vehicles. The evolution of electric vehicles, development of state-of-the-art sensors, and advances in artificial intelligence have provided necessary tools for the academia and industry to develop the prototypes of autonomous vehicles that enhance the road safety and traffic efficiency. The increase in the deployment of sensors for the autonomous vehicle, make it less cost-effective to be utilized by the consumer. This work focuses on the development of full-stack autonomous vehicle using the limited amount of sensors suite. The architecture aspect of the autonomous vehicle is categorized into four layers that include sensor layer, perception layer, planning layer and control layer. In the sensor layer, the integration of exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors on the autonomous vehicle are presented. The perception of the environment in term localization and detection using exteroceptive sensors are included in the perception layer. In the planning layer, algorithms for mission and motion planning are illustrated by incorporating the route information, velocity replanning and obstacle avoidance. The control layer constitutes lateral and longitudinal control for the autonomous vehicle. For the verification of the proposed system, the autonomous vehicle is tested in an unconstrained environment. The experimentation results show the efficacy of each module, including localization, object detection, mission and motion planning, obstacle avoidance, velocity replanning, lateral and longitudinal control. Further, in order to demonstrate the experimental validation and the application aspect of the autonomous vehicle, the proposed system is tested as an autonomous taxi service.", "Knowledge, technology, and society as well as natural systems are increasingly coherent and complex, and new systems are continuously formed at their interfaces. Convergence is a problem-solving strategy to holistically understand, create, and transform a system for reaching a common goal, such as advancing an emerging technology in society. The systems may be either in natural, scientific, technological, economic, or societal settings. Convergence offers a unifying strategy applicable to all systems that can be modeled as evolving neural-like networks. The paper presents an overview of the convergence science including underlying theories, principles, and methods and illustrates its implementation in key areas of application. The convergence approach begins with deep integration of previously separated fields, communities, and modes of thinking, to form and improve a new system, from where solutions divergence to previously unattainable applications and outcomes. The worldwide science and technology (S&T) landscape is changing at the beginning of the twenty-first century because of convergence. First, there is the affirmation of three transdisciplinary general-purpose technologies-nanotechnology, digital technology, and artificial intelligence (AI). A second main characteristics is the deep integration of five foundational science and technology fields (NBICA: nanoscale, modern biology, information, cognition, and artificial intelligence) from their basic elements-atoms, genes, bits, neurons, and logic steps and their collective action-to address global challenges and opportunities. The affirmation of nanotechnology at the confluence of disciplines toward systematic control of matter at the nanoscale has been an enabling inspiration and foundation for other S&T fields, emerging industries, and convergence solutions in society. Several future opportunities for implementation of convergence principles are the global S&T system, realizing sustainable society, advancing human capabilities, and conflict resolution.", "The study aimed to identify the mediating role of emotional intelligence and social competences in the relationship between gender and broad autism phenotype (BAP) as well as between age and BAP. It comprised 85 parents of children with ASD. They completed the questionnaires of Autism-Spectrum Quotient, social competences, and emotional intelligence. The results revealed that emotional intelligence in general and its two dimensions: the ability to accept and express emotions and to empathize are important mediators of the relationship between gender and BAP. Also, social competences in general and two of their dimensions: the effectiveness of behavior in intimate situations and in social situations were significant mediators. The relationship between age and BAP could not be confirmed.", "Skin-like optoelectronic sensors can have a wide range of technical applications ranging from wearable/implantable biodiagnostics, human-machine interfaces, and soft robotics to artificial intelligence. The previous focus has been on electrical signal transduction, whether resistive, capacitive, or piezoelectric. Here, we report on \"optical skin\" strain sensors based on elastomer-supported, highly ordered, and closely packed plasmonic nanocrystal arrays (plasmene). Using gold nanocubes (AuNCs) as a model system, we find that the types of polymeric ligands, interparticle spacing, and AuNC sizes play vital roles in strain-induced plasmonic responses. In particular, brush-forming polystyrene (PS) is a \"good\" ligand for forming elastic plasmenes which display strain-induced blue shift of high-energy plasmonic peaks with high reversibility upon strain release. Further experimental and simulation studies reveal the transition from isotropic uniform plasmon coupling at a non-strained state to anisotropic plasmon coupling at strained states, due to the AuNC alignment perpendicular to the straining direction. The two-term plasmonic ruler model may predict the primary high-energy peak location. Using the relative shift of the averaged high-energy peak to the coupling peak before straining, a plasmene nanosheet may be used as a strain sensor with the sensitivity depending on its internal structures, such as the constituent AuNC size or inter-particle spacing.", "The recent appearance and rapid spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus meant taking unprecedented measures to control the pandemic, which in Spain forced a state of alarm and a very strict confinement, leading the university system to become virtual online teaching. Taking into account the emotional deficiencies originated during the pandemic, among the most powerful tools to achieve engagement along with the identification, control and management of emotions is emotional intelligence (EI). The present study aims to establish the effect of the current confinement on the teaching-learning process and academic performance and the impact of the application of EI on university students. In total, 47 volunteers of the second course of the Degree in Pharmacy of the University of Granada (Spain) took part in this experience. Two temporary periods were established: at the beginning of the confinement period and after teaching several concepts of emotional intelligence online for two months. The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey Inventory (MBI-SS) and the Spanish version of Utrech Work Engagement Scale-Students (UWES-S) were used to evaluate the intervention. In total, 63.5% of the students presented academic burnout during the confinement before the intervention. After the EI workshops and seminars, only 31.1% presented academic burnout. Before the intervention with the emotional intelligence workshops, 44.6% experienced exhaustion, 41.7% cynicism and 60.3% felt it was ineffective in their academic performance. After the emotional intelligence workshops and seminars, 29.1% experienced exhaustion, 30.1% cynicism and 28.8% felt it was ineffective. The scores achieved after the study of EI in physiology classes led to better levels in all the variables studied. Students managed their adaptive processes more adequately and regulated their emotions better, as they felt less academic burnout and more engaged in their academic activities at the end of the study of EI through physiology.", "Tumor-educated platelets (TEPs) are potential biomarkers for cancer diagnostics. We employ TEP-derived RNA panels, determined by swarm intelligence, to detect and monitor glioblastoma. We assessed specificity by comparing the spliced RNA profile of TEPs from glioblastoma patients with multiple sclerosis and brain metastasis patients (validation series, n\u00a0= 157; accuracy, 80%; AUC, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.74-0.89; p\u00a0< 0.001]). Second, analysis of patients with glioblastoma versus asymptomatic healthy controls in an independent validation series (n\u00a0= 347) provided a detection accuracy of 95% and AUC of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99; p\u00a0< 0.001). Finally, we developed the digitalSWARM algorithm to improve monitoring of glioblastoma progression and demonstrate that the TEP tumor scores of individual glioblastoma patients represent tumor behavior and could be used to distinguish false positive progression from true progression (validation series, n\u00a0= 20; accuracy, 85%; AUC, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.70-1.00; p\u00a0< 0.012]). In conclusion, TEPs have potential as a minimally invasive biosource for blood-based diagnostics and monitoring of glioblastoma patients.", "An augmented reality (AR) platform combines several technologies in a system that can render individual \"digital objects\" that can be manipulated for a given purpose. In the audio domain, these may, for example, be generated by speaker separation, noise suppression, and signal enhancement. Access to the \"digital objects\" could be used to augment auditory objects that the user wants to hear better. Such AR platforms in conjunction with traditional hearing aids may contribute to closing the gap for people with hearing loss through multimodal sensor integration, leveraging extensive current artificial intelligence research, and machine-learning frameworks. This could take the form of an attention-driven signal enhancement and noise suppression platform, together with context awareness, which would improve the interpersonal communication experience in complex real-life situations. In that sense, an AR platform could serve as a frontend to current and future hearing solutions. The AR device would enhance the signals to be attended, but the hearing amplification would still be handled by hearing aids. In this article, suggestions are made about why AR platforms may offer ideal affordances to compensate for hearing loss, and how research-focused AR platforms could help toward better understanding of the role of hearing in everyday life.", "Research on causal reasoning often uses group-level data analyses that downplay individual differences and simple reasoning problems that are unrepresentative of everyday reasoning. In three empirical studies, we used an individual differences approach to investigate the cognitive processes people used in fault diagnosis, which is a complex diagnostic reasoning task. After first showing how high-level fault diagnosis strategies can be composed of simpler causal inferences, we discussed how two of these strategies-elimination and inference to the best explanation (IBE)-allow normative performance, which minimizes the number of diagnostic tests, whereas backtracking strategies are less efficient. We then investigated whether the use of normative strategies was infrequent and associated with greater fluid intelligence and positive thinking dispositions and whether normative strategies used slow, analytic processing while non-normative strategies used fast, heuristic processing.\nAcross three studies and 279 participants, uses of elimination and IBE were infrequent, and most participants used inefficient backtracking strategies. Fluid intelligence positively predicted elimination and IBE use but not backtracking use. Positive thinking dispositions predicted avoidance of backtracking. After classifying participants into groups that consistently used elimination, IBE, and backtracking, we found that participants who used elimination and IBE made fewer, but slower, diagnostic tests compared to backtracking users.\nParticipants' fault diagnosis performance showed wide individual differences. Use of normative strategies was predicted by greater fluid intelligence and more open-minded and engaged thinking dispositions. Elimination and IBE users made the slow, efficient responses typical of analytic processing. Backtracking users made the fast, inefficient responses suggestive of heuristic processing.", "It has been reported that people with schizophrenia are frequently overconfident relative to their performance, a trait observed in healthy individuals as well. In schizophrenia, impaired self-assessments have been found to be associated with functional impairments in various domains. Previous studies examining the correlation of overconfidence and task performance within domains (e.g., social cognition) had found overconfidence was associated with particularly poor performance. This study examines how overconfidence on a social cognitive emotion recognition task is correlated with performance on other social cognitive tests, measures of neurocognition, and intelligence. The sample includes 154 healthy controls and 218 outpatient individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. For the healthy controls, overconfidence was a significant predictor of poorer performance on social cognitive, but not neurocognitive tasks. For the participants with schizophrenia, overconfidence was a predictor of poorer performance on every performance-based task. In addition, overconfidence in healthy controls was more strongly correlated with intelligence than it was in participants with schizophrenia. The data suggest that a bias toward overestimation of performance aligns with poorer performance social cognitive domains, as well as neurocognitive domains in participants with schizophrenia. In healthy individuals, consistent with previous results, lower general intelligence seems to be a substantial predictor of overconfidence. These data suggest that attention to the accuracy of self-assessment is an area for future clinical interventions in people with schizophrenia.", "The living state is low entropy, highly complex organization, yet it is part of the energy cycle of the environment. Due to the recurring presence of the resting state, stimulus and its response form a thermodynamic cycle of perception that can be modeled by the Carnot engine. The endothermic reversed Carnot engine relies on energy from the environment to increase entropy (i.e., the synaptic complexity of the resting state). High entropy relies on mental energy, which represents intrinsic motivation and focuses on the future. It increases freedom of action. The Carnot engine can model exothermic, negative emotional states, which direct the focus on the past. The organism dumps entropy and energy to its environment, in the form of aggravation, anxiety, criticism, and physical violence. The loss of mental energy curtails freedom of action, forming apathy, depression, mental diseases, and immune problems. Our improving intuition about the brain's intelligent computations will allow the development of new treatments for mental disease and novel find applications in robotics and artificial intelligence.", "Atrial fibrillation (AF) associates with disability and frailty. Aim of this study was to evaluate in older AF patients, using artificial intelligence (AI), the relations between geriatric tools and daily standing and resting periods. We enrolled thirty-one\u2009>\u200965\u00a0years patients undergoing electrical cardioversion of AF (age: 79\u2009\u00b1\u20096\u00a0years; women: 41.9%; CHA2DS2-VASc: 3.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2; MMSE: 27.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7; GDS: 3.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8). The data of the first day following the procedure were analyzed using machine-learning techniques in a specifically designed cloud platform. Standing, activity, time (582\u2009\u00b1\u2009139\u00a0min) was directly associated with MMSE and inversely with GDS. Sleep length was 472\u2009\u00b1\u2009230\u00a0min. Light sleep, the longer resting phase, was inversely related to GDS. The Chest Effort Index, a measure of obstructive sleep apnea, grew with GDS. In conclusion, AI devices can be routinely used in improving older subjects' evaluation. A correlation exists between standing time, MMSE, and depressive symptoms. GDS associates to length and quality of sleep.", "Iodized salt is the mainstay intervention to tackle iodine-related disorders. In spite of the government's efforts to make iodized salt available in more than 90% of the households across the country, there are sketchy details on its use. Since the main propagators of this intervention are the mothers cooking in kitchen, this study was conceived, as a corollary to a larger micronutrient assessment study among school-going children.\nThe aim of this was to assess knowledge, practice of mothers of school-going children (6-16 years) regarding use of iodized salt, and to see any association between the simple psychological testing of the children and the iodine content of the salt used in home kitchen and the contributing factors thereof.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted by interviewing mothers of 240 school-going children of age groups 6-11 years and 12-16 years from six schools of Bhubaneswar using a semi-structured questionnaire regarding their knowledge on iodine and its deficiency and the practice of using iodized salt. MBI kit was used to assess the iodine content of salt used at home. The psychology adeptness of students was assessed using the standardized and validated coding, standard progressive matrices, and colored progressive matrices tests.\nAnalysis was done using SPSS version 16, wherein the sociodemographic data were shown in proportions, and the iodine content was taken as the dependent continuous variable and means reported. For the sake of associations with intelligence and cognition, a binary logistic regression model was drawn.\nIt reports that 47.5% of mothers knew that iodized salt is good for health and iodine content measured using MBI kit was 15 ppm and above for 71.7% of the sample. Further, iodine content in salt is seen as protective for cognition and also for IQ.\nThe knowledge of the mothers' needs reinforcement regarding iodine and related disorders and the benefits of iodized salt. The aim of the National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Program can only be achieved by generating awareness, regular follow-up, and improving the iodization of salt.", "Research attests to the important contributions of emotional, athletic, and cognitive expertise for sport performance. However, little is known regarding the interplay between trait emotional intelligence, athletic expertise, and working memory. The aim of this research was to examine the interplay between working memory (emotional, capacity and ability), trait emotional intelligence and athletic expertise. In total, 437 participants aged between 18 and 27\u00a0years with a range of athletic expertise (i.e., non-athlete n =\u00a096, novice n =\u00a092, amateur n =\u00a085, elite n =\u00a083, and super-elite n =\u00a081) completed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire Short Form, an Emotion Recognition Task (i.e., working memory-emotional), a Spatial Span Task (i.e., working memory-capacity), and a Spatial Working Memory Test (i.e., working memory-ability). Structural equation modelling indicated a significant positive relationship between trait emotional intelligence and all three components of working memory (i.e., emotional, capacity and ability). Also, this differed over athletic expertise whereby those with more expertise reported larger effects than those with less expertise. These findings suggest that trait emotional intelligence is important for working memory in athletes. Moreover, the link between cognitive and affective processes are increasingly relevant as athletes develop expertise levels.", "Insomnia subtypes are not well understood in the most severely affected children with autism spectrum disorder. We examined length of hospital stay, autism severity, nonverbal intelligence quotient, and behavioral functioning across insomnia subtypes in 427 psychiatrically hospitalized children with autism spectrum disorder (mean age = 12.8 \u00b1 3.4; 81.3% male). Per parent report, 60% (n = 257) of children had at least one type of insomnia. The distribution of subtypes was difficulty falling asleep (26.1%, n = 67), difficulty staying asleep (24.9%, n = 64), early morning awakening (4.3%, n = 11), and multiple insomnia symptoms (44.7%, n = 115). Difficulty staying asleep and early morning awakenings were associated with longer hospital stays. Early morning awakening was also associated with higher autism symptom severity. In general, children with difficulty staying asleep or multiple insomnia symptoms scored lower on adaptive behaviors (e.g. communication, self-care, socialization) and higher on maladaptive behaviors (e.g. irritability, hyperactivity, emotional reactivity, and emotional dysphoria). Difficulty staying asleep or having multiple insomnia symptoms appears to be most strongly related to impaired behavioral functioning. Conversely, early morning awakenings may be more closely tied with autism spectrum disorder itself. Further research is needed regarding insomnia subtypes at the severe end of the autism spectrum.", "Advancement in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), along with machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence techniques, initiated a world of possibilities in healthcare. It has an extensive range of applications: when connected to the Internet, ordinary medical devices and sensors can collect valuable data, deep learning, and artificial intelligence techniques utilize this data and give an insight of symptoms, trends and enable remote care. Recently, Covid-19 pandemic outbreak caused the death of a large number of people. This virus has infected millions of people, and still, the rate of infected people is increasing day by day. Researchers are endeavoring to utilize medical images and deep learning-based models for the detection of Covid-19. Various techniques have been presented that utilize X-Ray images of the chest for the detection of Covid-19. However, the importance of regional-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is currently confined. Thus, this research aimed to introduce an IoT-based deep learning framework for early assessment of Covid-19. This framework can reduce the working pressure of medical experts/radiologists and contribute to the pandemic control. A deep learning-based model, i.e., faster regions with CNNs (Faster-RCNN) with ResNet-101, is applied on X-Ray images of the chest for Covid-19 detection. It uses region proposal network (RPN) to perform detection. By employing the model, we achieve a detection accuracy of 98%. Therefore, we believe that the system might be capable in order to assist medical expert/radiologist, to verify early assessment toward Covid-19.", "Fifth Generation (5G) mobile communications technology became available in Japan as of the end of March 2020. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is proceeding with a plan to use 5G for a doctor-to-doctor remote diagnosis system. This remote diagnosis offers patients the benefit of receiving advanced medical care without having to travel long distances. The provision of a remote diagnosis will provide elderly patients in rural areas with an earlier diagnosis without burdening patients in Japan where the aging population and the uneven distribution of doctors are increasing. However, the system will increase the burden on specialists by expanding the doctor's catchment area. As a solution to that problem, deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to reduce the burden on doctors. In order to realize 5G- and AI-based real-time diagnostic support, diagnostic imaging using AI and an AI model that provides instructions are required. This is because ultrasonography and endoscopy, which can be used for remote diagnosis, do not acquire data on fixed areas like a CT or MRI scan. The AI model needs to instruct the doctor at the patient's home in order to collect appropriate information in accordance with the patient's symptoms and status. In order to build an interactive AI model, the interactions between doctors who are making a remote diagnosis should be recorded as training data and a 5G-based remote diagnosis system should be created. A remote diagnostic support system incorporating 5G and interactive diagnostic imaging incorporating AI will result in a system that places less of a burden on patients and doctors.", "Childhood exposure to domestic violence (DV) can lead to mental health problems including internalizing symptoms. This systematic literature review aimed to identify individual-, familial-, and community-level factors that mediate or modify the effect of DV exposure on internalizing symptoms among children and adolescents. This systematic literature review was registered with PROSPERO, registration number: CRD42019127012. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched between 1990 and 2018 for peer-reviewed, quantitative, longitudinal studies published in English. Backreferencing and key journal hand searches were conducted. Twelve longitudinal studies were included. These investigated how factors amenable to change either mediate or modify the effect of exposure to DV on internalizing symptoms (using validated measures) in children and adolescents up to 18 years within a general population. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa risk of bias tool, and a sample of studies were second reviewed by authors. One individual-level mediator was identified, namely emotional intelligence, and two effect modifiers were identified: relational victimization and participation in extracurricular activities. Familial mediators included maladaptive parenting and parenting stress, while effect modifiers included positive parenting (maternal warmth and availability) and family social support. No community-level factors were identified. All research was conducted in the United States, most focused on risk, and the majority measured outcomes in middle childhood. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that interventions provided to families exposed to intimate partner violence need to target both child and familial factors in order to successfully reduce children's internalizing symptoms.", "Monitoring the condition of rotating machinery, especially planetary gearboxes, is a challenging problem. In most of the available approaches, diagnostic procedures are related to advanced signal pre-processing/feature extraction methods or advanced data (features) analysis by using artificial intelligence. In this paper, the second approach is explored, so an application of decision trees for the classification of spectral-based 15D vectors of diagnostic data is proposed. The novelty of this paper is that by a combination of spectral analysis and the application of decision trees to a set of spectral features, we are able to take advantage of the multidimensionality of diagnostic data and classify/recognize the gearbox condition almost faultlessly even in non-stationary operating conditions. The diagnostics of time-varying systems are a complicated issue due to time-varying probability densities estimated for features. Using multidimensional data instead of an aggregated 1D feature, it is possible to improve the efficiency of diagnostics. It can be underlined that in comparison to previous work related to the same data, where the aggregated 1D variable was used, the efficiency of the proposed approach is around 99% (ca. 19% better). We tested several algorithms: classification and regression trees with the Gini index and entropy, as well as the random tree. We compare the obtained results with the K-nearest neighbors classification algorithm and meta-classifiers, namely: random forest and AdaBoost. As a result, we created the decision tree model with 99.74% classification accuracy on the test dataset.", "Rates of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME), a common ocular complication of diabetes mellitus, are increasing worldwide. There is a substantial burden concerning the detection and management of this condition, particularly in low-resource settings, due to limitations such as the time, cost, and labor associated with current screening and treatment methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a modality of pattern recognition that has the potential to combat these limitations in a reliable and cost-effective way. This review explores the various applications of AI on the screening, management, and treatment of DR and DME. AI applications for detecting referable DR and DME have been the most thoroughly researched applications for this condition. While some studies exist using AI to stratify DR patients based on the risk of progression, predict treatment outcomes to anti-VEGF therapy, and explore the utilization of AI for clinical trials to develop new treatments for DR, further validation studies on larger datasets are warranted.", "The analysis of bipartite networks is critical in a variety of application domains, such as exploring entity co-occurrences in intelligence analysis and investigating gene expression in bio-informatics. One important task is missing link prediction, which infers the existence of unseen links based on currently observed ones. In this article, we propose a visual analysis system, MissBiN, to involve analysts in the loop for making sense of link prediction results. MissBiN equips a novel method for link prediction in a bipartite network by leveraging the information of bi-cliques in the network. It also provides an interactive visualization for understanding the algorithm outputs. The design of MissBiN is based on three high-level analysis questions (what, why, and how) regarding missing links, which are distilled from the literature and expert interviews. We conducted quantitative experiments to assess the performance of the proposed link prediction algorithm, and interviewed two experts from different domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of MissBiN as a whole. We also provide a comprehensive usage scenario to illustrate the usefulness of the tool in an application of intelligence analysis.", "Modern medical care produces large volumes of multimodal patient data, which many clinicians struggle to process and synthesize into actionable knowledge. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as an effective tool in this regard. The field of hepatology is no exception, with a growing number of studies published that apply AI techniques to the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases. These have included machine-learning algorithms (such as regression models, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines) to predict disease progression, the presence of complications, and mortality; deep-learning algorithms to enable rapid, automated interpretation of radiologic and pathologic images; and natural-language processing to extract clinically meaningful concepts from vast quantities of unstructured data in electronic health records. This review article will provide a comprehensive overview of hepatology-focused AI research, discuss some of the barriers to clinical implementation and adoption, and suggest future directions for the field.", "Over the last two decades, heart centres have developed strategies to meet the neurodevelopmental needs of children with congenital heart disease. Since the publication of guidelines in 2012, cardiac neurodevelopmental follow-up programmes have become more widespread. Local neurodevelopmental programmes, however, have been developed independently in widely varying environments. We sought to characterise variation in structure and personnel in cardiac neurodevelopmental programmes. A 31-item survey was sent to all member institutions of the Cardiac Neurodevelopmental Outcome Collaborative. Multidisciplinary teams at each centre completed the survey. Responses were compiled in a descriptive fashion. Of the 29 invited centres, 23 responded to the survey (79%). Centres reported more anticipated neurodevelopment visits between birth and 5 years of age (median 5, range 2-8) than 5-18 years (median 2, range 0-10) with 53% of centres lacking any standard for routine neurodevelopment evaluations after 5 years of age. Estimated annual neurodevelopment clinic volume ranged from 85 to 428 visits with a median of 16% of visits involving children >5 years of age. Among responding centres, the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence were the most routinely used tests. Neonatal clinical assessment was more common (64%) than routine neonatal brain imaging (23%) during hospitalisation. In response to clinical need and published guidelines, centres have established formal cardiac neurodevelopment follow-up programmes. Centres vary considerably in their approaches to routine screening and objective testing, with many centres currently focussing their resources on evaluating younger patients.", "Inferring missing links based on the currently observed network is known as link prediction, which has tremendous real-world applications in biomedicine, e-commerce, social media, and criminal intelligence. Numerous methods have been proposed to solve the link prediction problem. Yet, many of these methods are designed for undirected networks only and based on domain-specific heuristics. Here we developed a new link prediction method based on deep generative models, which does not rely on any domain-specific heuristic and works for general undirected or directed complex networks. Our key idea is to represent the adjacency matrix of a network as an image and then learn hierarchical feature representations of the image by training a deep generative model. Those features correspond to structural patterns in the network at different scales, from small subgraphs to mesoscopic communities. When applied to various real-world networks from different domains, our method shows overall superior performance against existing methods.", "To compare insulin dose adjustments made by physicians to those made by an artificial intelligence-based decision support system, the Advisor Pro, in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using an insulin pump and self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG).\nThis was a multinational, non-interventional study surveying 17 physicians from 11 countries. Each physician was asked to provide insulin dose adjustments for the settings of the pump including basal rate, carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios (CRs), and correction factors (CFs) for 15 data sets of pumps and SMBG of people with T1D (mean age 18.4 \u00b1 4.8 years; eight females; mean glycated hemoglobin 8.2% \u00b1 1.4% [66 \u00b1 11mmol/mol]). The recommendations were compared among the physicians and between the physicians and the Advisor Pro. The study endpoint was the percentage of comparison points for which there was an agreement on the direction of insulin dose adjustments.\nThe percentage (mean \u00b1 SD) of agreement among the physicians on the direction of insulin pump dose adjustments was 51.8% \u00b1 9.2%, 54.2% \u00b1 6.4%, and 49.8% \u00b1 11.6% for the basal, CR, and CF, respectively. The automated recommendations of the Advisor Pro on the direction of insulin dose adjustments were comparable )49.5% \u00b1 6.4%, 55.3% \u00b1 8.7%, and 47.6% \u00b1 14.4% for the basal rate, CR, and CF, respectively( and noninferior to those provided by physicians. The mean absolute difference in magnitude of change between physicians was 17.1% \u00b1 13.1%, 14.6% \u00b1 8.4%, and 23.9% \u00b1 18.6% for the basal, CR, and CF, respectively, and comparable to the Advisor Pro 11.7% \u00b1 9.7%, 10.1% \u00b1 4.5%, and 25.5% \u00b1 19.5%, respectively, significant for basal and CR.\nConsiderable differences in the recommendations for changes in insulin dosing were observed among physicians. Since automated recommendations by the Advisor Pro were similar to those given by physicians, it could be considered a useful tool to manage T1D.", "The primary objective of this study was to predict subgroups of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on the Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-IV Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) by machine learning (ML). The secondary objective was to set up a ranking of Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) diagnostic algorithm items based on ML, and to confirm whether ML can sufficiently predict the diagnosis with these minimum items.\nIn the first experiment, a multiclass decision forest algorithm was applied, and the diagnostic algorithm score value of 1,269 Korean ADI-R test data was used for prediction. In the second experiment, we used 539 Korean ADI-R case data (over 48 months with verbal language) to apply mutual information to rank items used in the ADI diagnostic algorithm.\nIn the first experiment, the results of predicting in the case of pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified as \"ASD\" were almost three times higher than predicting it as \"No diagnosis.\" In the second experiment, the top 10 ranking items of ADI-R were mainly related to the quality abnormality of communication.\nIn conclusion, we verified the applicability of ML in diagnosis and found that the application of artificial intelligence for rapid diagnosis or screening of ASD patients may be useful.", "Specific Language Impairment (SLI) and Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) have been the subject of extensive research especially with respect to the connection between them. However, the manifestation of these disorders in adolescence has not been thoroughly investigated. The objective of the present study was to compare the intelligence scores and the reading, oral and written language skills of Greek adolescents with SLI and Greek adolescents with SLD, as assessed during their psycho-educational evaluation, in order to clear the path for diagnosis and intervention. 124 Greek adolescents diagnosed with Specific Learning Disabilities and 76 Greek adolescents diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment aged from 11 to 16 years took part in the study. All participants were assessed in reading, oral language and written language skills and took part in IQ testing. Independent samples t-test, chi-square test, odds ratios and their 95 percent confidence intervals were implemented to determine statistically significant differences. Analyses revealed differences in IQ scores and some differences in the skills assessed, thus indicating that SLI adolescents exhibited more difficulties across most of the basic academic skills, whereas SLD adolescents' difficulties confined to the affected written language skills. Specifically, the observed difference was statistically significant for the total and verbal IQ score, and WISC-III scores also disclosed a significant difference for the similarities and information defisub- tests. Regarding reading skills, SLI adolescents were 4.9 times more likely to exhibit line skipping, 5.8 times more likely to exhibit hesitations, 3.2 times more likely to exhibit repetitions of syllables/words/ phrases, and 8.5 times more likely to exhibit non-acknowledgement of punctuation. Regarding reading comprehension, adolescents with SLI were more likely to have difficulty in retrieving simple information questions, making inferences, and giving titles. Adolescents with SLI were also more likely to have difficulties in story reproduction, giving synonyms/opposites, oral sentence reproduction and auditory oral word reproduction. In the area of written language skills, SLI adolescents were more likely to have poor handwriting, poor content, poor structure, and poor use of punctuation. In adolescence, Specific Language Impairment can be a different manifestation of an ongoing language disorder, which finally appears as a different type of Specific Learning Disability, but with a more generalized nature of learning difficulties. This finding should be interpreted in terms of the importance of differential diagnosis, especially during the challenging period of adolescence.", "The high demand for health care services and the growing capability of artificial intelligence have led to the development of conversational agents designed to support a variety of health-related activities, including behavior change, treatment support, health monitoring, training, triage, and screening support. Automation of these tasks could free clinicians to focus on more complex work and increase the accessibility to health care services for the public. An overarching assessment of the acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of these agents in health care is needed to collate the evidence so that future development can target areas for improvement and potential for sustainable adoption.\nThis systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and usability of conversational agents in health care and identify the elements that users like and dislike to inform future research and development of these agents.\nPubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library were systematically searched for articles published since 2008 that evaluated unconstrained natural language processing conversational agents used in health care. EndNote (version X9, Clarivate Analytics) reference management software was used for initial screening, and full-text screening was conducted by 1 reviewer. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed by one reviewer and validated by another.\nA total of 31 studies were selected and included a variety of conversational agents, including 14 chatbots (2 of which were voice chatbots), 6 embodied conversational agents (3 of which were interactive voice response calls, virtual patients, and speech recognition screening systems), 1 contextual question-answering agent, and 1 voice recognition triage system. Overall, the evidence reported was mostly positive or mixed. Usability and satisfaction performed well (27/30 and 26/31), and positive or mixed effectiveness was found in three-quarters of the studies (23/30). However, there were several limitations of the agents highlighted in specific qualitative feedback.\nThe studies generally reported positive or mixed evidence for the effectiveness, usability, and satisfactoriness of the conversational agents investigated, but qualitative user perceptions were more mixed. The quality of many of the studies was limited, and improved study design and reporting are necessary to more accurately evaluate the usefulness of the agents in health care and identify key areas for improvement. Further research should also analyze the cost-effectiveness, privacy, and security of the agents.\nRR2-10.2196/16934.", "As artificial intelligence and big data analysis develop rapidly, data privacy, especially patient medical data privacy, is getting more and more attention.\nThe study aims to strengthen the protection of private data while ensuring the model training process; this article introduces a multi-Blockchain-based decentralized collaborative machine learning training method for medical image analysis. In this way, researchers from different medical institutions are able to collaborate to train models without exchanging sensitive patient data.\nPartial parameter update method is applied to prevent indirect privacy leakage during model propagation. With the peer-to-peer communication in the multi-Blockchain system, a machine learning task can leverage auxiliary information from another similar task in another Blockchain. In addition, after the collaborative training process, personalized models of different medical institutions will be trained.\nThe experimental results show that our method achieves similar performance with the centralized model-training method by collecting data sets of all participants and prevents private data leakage at the same time. Transferring auxiliary information from similar task on another Blockchain has also been proven to effectively accelerate model convergence and improve model accuracy, especially in the scenario of absence of data. Personalization training process further improves model performance.\nOur approach can effectively help researchers from different organizations to achieve collaborative training without disclosing their private data.", "The artificial intelligence field is obtaining ever-increasing interests for enhancing the accuracy of diagnosis and the quality of patient care. Deep learning neural network (DLNN) approach was considered in patients with brain stroke (BS) to predict and classify the outcome by the risk factors.\nA total of 332 patients with BS (mean age: 77.4 [standard deviation: 10.4] years, 50.6% - male) from Imam Khomeini Hospital, Ardabil, Iran, during 2008-2018 participated in this prospective study. Data were gathered from the available documents of the BS registry. Furthermore, the diagnosis of BS was considered based on computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. The DLNN strategy was applied to predict the effects of the main risk factors on mortality. The quality of the model was measured by diagnostic indices.\nThe finding of this study for 81 selected models demonstrated that ranges of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 90.5%-99.7%, 83.8%-100%, and 89.8%-99.5%, respectively. Based on the optimal model (tangent hyperbolic activation function with the minimum-maximum hidden units of 10-20, max epochs of 400, momentum of 0.5, and learning rate of 0.1), the most important predictors for BS mortality were time interval after 10 years (accuracy = 92.2%), age category (75.6%), the history of hyperlipoproteinemia (66.9%), and education level (66.9%). The other independent variables are at moderate importance (66.6%) which include sex, employment status, residential place, smoking habits, history of heart disease, cerebrovascular accident type, blood pressure, diabetes, oral contraceptive pill use, and physical activity.\nThe best means for dropping the BS load is effective BS prevention. DLNN strategy showed a surprising presentation in the prediction of BS mortality based on the main risk factors with an excellent diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the time interval after 10 years, age, the history of hyperlipoproteinemia, and education level are the most important predictors for BS.", "Objective. While prosthetic hands with independently actuated digits have become commercially available, state-of-the-art human-machine interfaces (HMI) only permit control over a limited set of grasp patterns, which does not enable amputees to experience sufficient improvement in their daily activities to make an active prosthesis useful.Approach. Here we present a technology platform combining fully-integrated bioelectronics, implantable intrafascicular microelectrodes and deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate this missing bridge by tapping into the intricate motor control signals of peripheral nerves. The bioelectric neural interface includes an ultra-low-noise neural recording system to sense electroneurography (ENG) signals from microelectrode arrays implanted in the residual nerves, and AI models employing the recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to decode the subject's motor intention.Main results. A pilot human study has been carried out on a transradial amputee. We demonstrate that the information channel established by the proposed neural interface is sufficient to provide high accuracy control of a prosthetic hand up to 15 degrees of freedom (DOF). The interface is intuitive as it directly maps complex prosthesis movements to the patient's true intention.Significance. Our study layouts the foundation towards not only a robust and dexterous control strategy for modern neuroprostheses at a near-natural level approaching that of the able hand, but also an intuitive conduit for connecting human minds and machines through the peripheral neural pathways.Clinical trial: DExterous Hand Control Through Fascicular Targeting (DEFT). Identifier: NCT02994160.", "Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is an essential diagnostic tool for various types of pancreatic diseases such as pancreatic tumors and chronic pancreatitis; however, EUS imaging has low specificity for the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a mathematical prediction technique that automates learning and recognizes patterns in data. This review describes the details and principles of AI and deep learning algorithms. The term AI does not have any definite definition; almost all AI systems fall under narrow AI, which can handle single or limited tasks. Deep learning is based on neural networks, which is a machine learning technique that is widely used in the medical field. Deep learning involves three phases: data collection and annotation, building the deep learning architecture, and training and ability validation. For medical image diagnosis, image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation are performed. In EUS, AI is used for detecting anatomical features, differential pancreatic tumors, and cysts. For this, conventional machine learning architectures are used, and deep learning architecture has been used in only two reports. Although the diagnostic abilities in these reports were about 85-95%, these were exploratory research and very few reports have included substantial evidence. AI is increasingly being used for medical image diagnosis due to its high performance and will soon become an essential technique for medical diagnosis.", "Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress of intelligent robots brought about by mimicking human intelligence. However, current robots are still far from being able to handle multiple tasks in a dynamic environment as efficiently as humans. To cope with complexity and variability, further progress toward scalability and adaptability are essential for intelligent robots. Here, we report a brain-inspired robotic platform implemented by an unmanned bicycle that exhibits scalability of network scale, quantity and diversity to handle the changing needs of different scenarios. The platform adopts rich coding schemes and a trainable and scalable neural state machine, enabling flexible cooperation of hybrid networks. In addition, an embedded system is developed using a cross-paradigm neuromorphic chip to facilitate the implementation of diverse neural networks in spike or non-spike form. The platform achieved various real-time tasks concurrently in different real-world scenarios, providing a new pathway to enhance robots' intelligence.", "Most oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumors arise from oral premalignant lesions. Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), usually occurring in male chewers of betel quid, is a premalignant stromal disease characterized by a high malignant transformation rate and high prevalence. Although a relationship between the inhabited microbiome and carcinogenesis has been proposed, no detailed information regarding the oral microbiome of patients with OSF exists; the changes of the salivary microbiome during cancer formation remain unclear. This study compared the salivary microbiomes of male patients with OSCC and a predisposing OSF background (OSCC-OSF group) and those with OSF only (OSF group). The results of high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene indicated that OSF-related carcinogenesis and smoking status significantly contributed to phylogenetic composition variations in the salivary microbiome, leading to considerable reductions in species richness and phylogenetic diversity. The microbiome profile of OSF-related malignancy was associated with increased microbial stochastic fluctuation, which dominated the salivary microbiome assembly and caused species co-occurrence network collapse. Artificial intelligence selection algorithms consistently identified 5 key species in the OSCC-OSF group: Porphyromonas catoniae, Prevotella multisaccharivorax, Prevotella sp. HMT-300, Mitsuokella sp. HMT-131, and Treponema sp. HMT-927. Robust accuracy in predicting oral carcinogenesis was obtained with our exploratory and validation data sets. In functional analysis, the microbiome of the OSCC-OSF group had greater potential for S-adenosyl-l-methionine and norspermidine synthesis but lower potential for l-ornithine and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and formaldehyde metabolism. These findings indicated that the salivary microbiome plays important roles in modulating microbial metabolites during oral carcinogenesis. In conclusion, our results provided new insights into salivary microbiome alterations during the malignant transformation of OSF.", "Whole slide imaging (WSI) has various uses, including the development of decision support systems, image analysis, education, conferences, and remote diagnostics. It is also used to develop artificial intelligence using machine learning methods. In the clinical setting, however, many issues have hindered the implementation of WSI. These issues are becoming more important as WSI is gaining wider use in clinical practice, particularly with the implementation of artificial intelligence in pathological diagnosis. One of the most important issues is the standardization of color for WSI, which is an important component of digital pathology. In this paper, we review the major factors of color variation and how to evaluate and modify color variation to establish color standardization. There are five major reasons for color variation, which include specimen thickness, staining, scanner, viewer, and display. Recognizing that the color is not standardized is the first step towards standardization, and it is difficult to ascertain whether the appropriate color of the WSI is displayed at the reviewers' end.", "The ever-growing availability of imaging led to increasing incidentally discovered unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). We leveraged machine-learning techniques and advanced statistical methods to provide new insights into rupture intracranial aneurysm (RIA) risks.\nWe analysed the characteristics of 2505 patients with intracranial aneurysms (IA) discovered between 2016 and 2019. Baseline characteristics, familial history of IA, tobacco and alcohol consumption, pharmacological treatments before the IA diagnosis, cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, headaches, allergy and atopy, IA location, absolute IA size and adjusted size ratio (aSR) were analysed with a multivariable logistic regression (MLR) model. A random forest (RF) method globally assessed the risk factors and evaluated the predictive capacity of a multivariate model.\nAmong 994 patients with RIA (39.7%) and 1511 patients with UIA (60.3 %), the MLR showed that IA location appeared to be the most significant factor associated with RIA (OR, 95% CI: internal carotid artery, reference; middle cerebral artery, 2.72, 2.02-3.58; anterior cerebral artery, 4.99, 3.61-6.92; posterior circulation arteries, 6.05, 4.41-8.33). Size and aSR were not significant factors associated with RIA in the MLR model and antiplatelet-treatment intake patients were less likely to have RIA (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55-0.98). IA location, age, following by aSR were the best predictors of RIA using the RF model.\nThe location of IA is the most consistent parameter associated with RIA. The use of 'artificial intelligence' RF helps to re-evaluate the contribution and selection of each risk factor in the multivariate model.", "Coordination of various physical and mental aspects of individuals, including the ability to control difficult conditions and situations has an effect in the prevention and development of various diseases, such as diabetes, and the improvement of the quality of life. Therefore, the purpose of this study was is to determine the effect of emotional intelligence on the quality of life of elderly diabetic patients.\nThis study was conducted in 2018. The statistical population in this cross-sectional study consisted of elderly people referred to the health centers of Kermanshah province in western Iran, who were divided via available sampling into two groups with diabetes and without diabetes. Data gathering tools were a couple of LIPAD Quality of Life and Shrink Emotional Intelligence standard questionnaires. The Data was analysed using software SPSS, 23 th version. Tests were used (T-test, Chi-square, Anova and regression).\nMost of them were male (52.72%) and the mean age of the patients was 65.01(\u00b16.08) years old and married. The quality of life score in diabetics and non-diabetics was respectively 51.9 and 50.37 with a standard deviation of 17.73 and 20.54. The mean total score of emotional intelligence in the elderly with diabetes was 99.42 with a standard deviation of 10.37 and non-diabetic subjects were 97.18 with a standard deviation of 18.4.\nThere was no significant difference between the mean scores of quality of life (0.652) and emotional intelligence (0.421) in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. But, the emotional intelligence has an effect on the quality of life of the elderly people.", "Although artificial intelligence (AI) was initially developed many years ago, it has experienced spectacular advances over the last 10 years for application in the field of medicine, and is now used for diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic purposes in almost all fields. Its application in the area of hepatology is especially relevant for the study of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as this is a very common tumor, with particular radiological characteristics that allow its diagnosis without the need for a histological study. However, the interpretation and analysis of the resulting images is not always easy, in addition to which the images vary during the course of the disease, and prognosis and treatment response can be conditioned by multiple factors. The vast amount of data available lend themselves to study and analysis by AI in its various branches, such as deep-learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), which play a fundamental role in decision-making as well as overcoming the constraints involved in human evaluation. ML is a form of AI based on automated learning from a set of previously provided data and training in algorithms to organize and recognize patterns. DL is a more extensive form of learning that attempts to simulate the working of the human brain, using a lot more data and more complex algorithms. This review specifies the type of AI used by the various authors. However, well-designed prospective studies are needed in order to avoid as far as possible any bias that may later affect the interpretability of the images and thereby limit the acceptance and application of these models in clinical practice. In addition, professionals now need to understand the true usefulness of these techniques, as well as their associated strengths and limitations.", "To purpose of this paper was to assess the feasibility of volumetric breast density estimations on MRI without segmentations accompanied with an explainability step. A total of 615 patients with breast cancer were included for volumetric breast density estimation. A 3-dimensional regression convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to estimate the volumetric breast density. Patients were split in training (N\u2009=\u2009400), validation (N\u2009=\u200950), and hold-out test set (N\u2009=\u2009165). Hyperparameters were optimized using Neural Network Intelligence and augmentations consisted of translations and rotations. The estimated densities were evaluated to the ground truth using Spearman's correlation and Bland-Altman plots. The output of the CNN was visually analyzed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Spearman's correlation between estimated and ground truth density was \u03c1\u2009=\u20090.81 (N\u2009=\u2009165, P\u2009<\u20090.001) in the hold-out test set. The estimated density had a median bias of 0.70% (95% limits of agreement\u2009=\u2009-\u20096.8% to 5.0%) to the ground truth. SHAP showed that in correct density estimations, the algorithm based its decision on fibroglandular and fatty tissue. In incorrect estimations, other structures such as the pectoral muscle or the heart were included. To conclude,\u00a0it is feasible to automatically estimate volumetric breast density on MRI without segmentations, and to provide accompanying explanations.", "Scores can assess the severity and course of disease and predict outcome in an objective manner. This information is needed for proper risk assessment and stratification. Furthermore, scoring systems support optimal patient care, resource management and are gaining in importance in terms of artificial intelligence.\nThis study evaluated and compared the prognostic ability of various common pediatric scoring systems (PRISM, PRISM III, PRISM IV, PIM, PIM2, PIM3, PELOD, PELOD 2) in order to determine which is the most applicable score for pediatric sepsis patients in terms of timing of disease survey and insensitivity to missing data.\nWe retrospectively examined data from 398 patients under 18 years of age, who were diagnosed with sepsis. Scores were assessed at ICU admission and re-evaluated on the day of peak C-reactive protein. The scores were compared for their ability to predict mortality in this specific patient population and for their impairment due to missing data.\nPIM (AUC 0.76 (0.68-0.76)), PIM2 (AUC 0.78 (0.72-0.78)) and PIM3 (AUC 0.76 (0.68-0.76)) scores together with PRSIM III (AUC 0.75 (0.68-0.75)) and PELOD 2 (AUC 0.75 (0.66-0.75)) are the most suitable scores for determining patient prognosis at ICU admission. Once sepsis is pronounced, PELOD 2 (AUC 0.84 (0.77-0.91)) and PRISM IV (AUC 0.8 (0.72-0.88)) become significantly better in their performance and count among the best prognostic scores for use at this time together with PRISM III (AUC 0.81 (0.73-0.89)). PELOD 2 is good for monitoring and, like the PIM scores, is also largely insensitive to missing values.\nOverall, PIM scores show comparatively good performance, are stable as far as timing of the disease survey is concerned, and they are also relatively stable in terms of missing parameters. PELOD 2 is best suitable for monitoring clinical course.", "Developments in enhanced and magnified endoscopy have signified major advances in endoscopic imaging of ileocolonic pathology in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to augment the benefits of these advanced techniques. Nevertheless, treatment of IBD patients is frustrated by high rates of non-response to therapy, while delayed detection and failures to detect neoplastic lesions impede successful surveillance. A possible solution is offered by molecular imaging, which adds functional imaging data to mucosal morphology assessment through visualizing biological parameters. Other label-free modalities enable visualization beyond the mucosal surface without the need of tracers.\nA literature search up to May 2020 was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE in order to find relevant articles that involve the (pre-)clinical application of high-definition white light endoscopy, chromoendoscopy, artificial intelligence, confocal laser endomicroscopy, endocytoscopy, molecular imaging, optical coherence tomography, and Raman spectroscopy in IBD.\nEnhanced and magnified endoscopy have enabled an improved assessment of the ileocolonic mucosa. Implementing molecular imaging in endoscopy could overcome the remaining clinical challenges by giving practitioners a real-time in vivo view of targeted biomarkers. Label-free modalities could help optimize the endoscopic assessment of mucosal healing and dysplasia detection in IBD patients.", "Radiomics is a relatively new approach for image analysis. As a part of radiomics, texture analysis, which consists in extracting a great amount of quantitative data from original images, can be used to identify specific features that can help determining the actual nature of a pancreatic lesion and providing other information such as resectability, tumor grade, tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy or survival after surgery. In this review, the basic of radiomics, recent developments and the results of texture analysis using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the field of pancreatic tumors are presented. Future applications of radiomics, such as artificial intelligence, are discussed.", "We discuss recent advancements in structural biology methods for investigating sites of protein-protein interactions. We will inform readers outside the field of structural biology about techniques beyond crystallography, and how these different technologies can be utilized for drug development.\nAdvancements in cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and micro-electron diffraction (microED) may change how we view atomic resolution structural biology, such that well-ordered macrocrystals of protein complexes are not required for interface identification. However, some drug discovery applications, such as lead peptide compound generation, may not require atomic resolution; mass spectrometry techniques can provide an expedited path to generation of lead compounds. New crosslinking compounds, more user-friendly data analysis, and novel protocols such as protein painting can advance drug discovery programs, even in the absence of atomic resolution structural data. Finally, artificial intelligence and machine learning methods, while never truly replacing experimental methods, may provide rational ways to stratify potential druggable regions identified with mass spectrometry into higher and lower priority candidates.\nElectron diffraction of nanocrystals combines the benefits of both x-ray diffraction and cryoEM, and may prove to be the next generation of atomic resolution protein-protein interface identification. However, in situations such as peptide drug discovery, mass spectrometry techniques supported by advancements in computational methods will likely prove sufficient to support drug discovery efforts. In addition, these methods can be significantly faster than any crystallographic or cryoEM methods for identification of interacting regions.", "The relationship between cognitive abilities and academic achievement across schooling from the first to the eleventh grade was analyzed. Information processing speed, visuospatial working memory, number sense, and fluid intelligence were considered predictors of general academic achievement, which was derived from grades in mathematics, language, and biology. This cross-sectional study involved 1560 pupils who were in grades 1-11 at general education schools and were aged from 6.8 to 19.1 years (50.4% were boys). Information processing speed, visuospatial working memory, and number sense were measured using the Choice Reaction Time, Corsi Block-Tapping, and Number Sense computerized tests, respectively. Fluid intelligence was measured using the paper-and-pencil version of the Standard Progressive Matrices test. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were carried out. It was shown that it is possible to describe the structure of the relationship between cognitive abilities and academic achievement for all levels of schooling with a single model. In this model, information processing speed is the key predictor of fluid intelligence, working memory, and number sense, which in turn contribute to individual differences in academic success. Additionally, the specificity of the relationship between individual indicators of cognitive abilities and academic achievement at each level of schooling was revealed.", "Repeated invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is desirable because many neurosurgical pathologies are associated with elevated ICP. On the other hand, it could become a risk for children to repeat sedation, anesthesia, or radiation exposure. As a non-invasive method, measurements of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has been revealed to accurately predict increased ICP. However, no studies have indicated a relationship among age, brain, and ventricular parameters in normal children, nor a prediction of increased ICP with artificial intelligence.\nThis study enrolled 400 normal children for control and 75 children with signs of increased ICP between 2009 and 2019. Measurements of the parameters including ONSD on CT were obtained. A supervised machine learning was applied to predict suspected increased ICP based on CT measurements. A linear correlation was shown between ln(age) and mean ONSD (mONSD) in normal children, revealing mONSD = 0.36ln(age)+2.26 (R2 = 0.60). This study revealed a linear correlation of mONSD measured on CT with ln(age) and the width of the brain, not the width of the ventricles in 400 normal children based on the univariate analyses. Additionally, the multivariate analyses revealed minimum bicaudate nuclei distance was also associated with mONSD. The results of the group comparison between control and suspected increased ICP revealed a statistical significance in mONSD and the width of the ventricles. The study indicated that supervised machine learning application could be applied to predict suspected increased ICP in children, with an accuracy of 94% for training, 91% for test.\nThis study clarified three issues regarding ONSD and ICP. Mean ONSD measured on CT was correlated with ln(age) and the width of the brain, not the width of the ventricles in 400 normal children based on the univariate analyses. The multivariate analyses revealed minimum bicaudate nuclei distance was also associated with mONSD. Mean ONSD and the width of ventricles were statistically significant in children with signs of elevated ICP. Finally, the study showed that machine learning could be used to predict children with suspected increased ICP.", "Automated collection of on-vehicle sensor data allows the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for vehicular systems' diagnostic and prognostic processes to better assess the state-of-health, predict faults and evaluate residual life of ground vehicle systems. One of the vital subsystems, in terms of safety and mission criticality, is the power train, (comprising the engine, transmission, and final drives), which provides the driving torque required for vehicle acceleration. In this paper, a novel health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) architecture is presented, together with dedicated diagnosis/prognosis algorithms that utilize data gathered from a sensor network embedded in an armoured personnel carrier (APC) vehicle. To model the drivetrain, a virtual dynamometer is introduced, which estimates the engine torque output for successive comparison with the measured torque values taken from the engine control unit. This virtual dynamometer is also used in conjunction with other sensed variables to determine the maximum torque output of the engine, which is considered to be the primary indicator of engine health. Regression analysis is performed to capture the effect of certain variables such as engine hours, oil temperature, and coolant temperature on the degradation of maximum engine torque. Degradations in the final drives system were identified using a comparison of the temperature trends between the left-hand and right-hand final drives. This research lays foundations for the development of real-time diagnosis and prognosis functions for an integrated vehicle health management (IVHM) system suitable for safety critical manned and unmanned vehicle applications.", "The pandemic of the SARS CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19 sickness, constitutes a global challenge to well-being. Positive psychology constructs of grit and growth mindset may offer a solution to this challenge as both are associated with psychological resilience. A growth mindset describes the underlying beliefs people have about the malleability of intelligence, and grit refers to dedication to long-term goals. The present study explored whether such constructs could constitute protective factors against the academic stress associated with loneliness and perceived lack of control among international students (n\u2009=\u2009170) during social isolation, induced by COVID-19 restrictions. The results of a hierarchical multiple regression model explained 36% of the variance in academic stress with a perceived lack of control (\u00df\u2009=\u2009.53, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and growth mindset (\u00df\u2009=\u2009-.22, p\u2009<\u2009.001) being significant direct predictors. Moderation analysis explained 17% of the variance and confirmed that a level of dispositional grit moderated the detrimental influence loneliness had on academic stress. Simple slopes analysis revealed a significant effect for moderate (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.07, p\u2009=\u2009.01) and high (\u03b2\u2009=\u00a0.16, p\u2009=\u2009.001) levels of grit. Our findings suggest that grit and growth mindset, as dynamic variables, could be taught to students as resilience-building prevention of academic stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, our results have shown that parents (37%) and friends (32%) were most frequently identified by students as supporters during the COVID-19 pandemic with minimal reported support from universities (2.5%).", "In the current study, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach was used for the learning of a physical system. We applied four inputs and one output in the learning process of AI. In the learning process, the inputs are space locations of a BCR (bubble column reactor), which are x, y, and z coordinate as well as the amount of gas fraction in BCR. The liquid velocity is also considered as output. A variety of functions were used in learning, such as gbellmf and gaussmf functions, to examine which functions can give the best learning. At the end of the study, all of the results were compared to CFD (computational fluid dynamics). A three-dimensional (3D) BCR was used in this research, and we studied simulation by CFD as well as AI. The data from CFD in a 3D BCR was studied in the AI domain. In AI, we tuned for various parameters to achieve the best intelligence in the system. For instance, different inputs, different membership functions, different numbers of membership functions were used in the learning process. Moreover, the meshless prediction was used, meaning that some data in the BCR have not participated in the learning, and they were predicted in the prediction process, which gives us a special capability to compare the results with the CFD outcomes. The findings showed us that AI can predict the CFD results, and a great agreement was achieved between CFD computing nodes and AI elements. This novel methodology can suggest a meshless and multifunctional AI model to simulate the turbulence flow in the BCR. For further evaluation, the ANFIS method is compared with ACOFIS and PSOFIS methods with regards to model's accuracy. The results show that ANFIS method contains higher accuracy and prediction capability compared with ACOFIS and PSOFIS methods.", "Diminished visual monitoring of faces and activities of others is an early feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is uncertain whether deficits in activity monitoring, identified using a homogeneous set of stimuli, persist throughout the lifespan in ASD, and thus, whether they could serve as a biological indicator (\"biomarker\") of ASD. We investigated differences in visual attention during activity monitoring in children and adult participants with autism compared to a control group of participants without autism.\nEye movements of participants with autism (n\u2009=\u2009122; mean age [SD]\u2009=\u200914.5 [8.0] years) and typically developing (TD) controls (n\u2009=\u200940, age\u2009=\u200916.4 [13.3] years) were recorded while they viewed a series of videos depicting two female actors conversing while interacting with their hands over a shared task. Actors either continuously focused their gaze on each other's face (mutual gaze) or on the shared activity area (shared focus). Mean percentage looking time was computed for the activity area, actors' heads, and their bodies.\nCompared to TD participants, participants with ASD looked longer at the activity area (mean % looking time: 58.5% vs. 53.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.005) but less at the heads (15.2% vs. 23.7%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Additionally, within-group differences in looking time were observed between the mutual gaze and shared focus conditions in both participants without ASD (activity: \u0394\u2009=\u2009-\u20096.4%, p\u2009<\u20090.004; heads: \u0394\u2009=\u2009+\u20093.5%, p\u2009<\u20090.02) and participants with ASD (bodies: \u0394\u2009=\u2009+\u20091.6%, p\u2009<\u20090.002).\nThe TD participants were not as well characterized as the participants with ASD. Inclusion criteria regarding the cognitive ability [intelligence quotient (IQ)\u2009>\u200960] limited the ability to include individuals with substantial intellectual disability.\nDifferences in attention to faces could constitute a feature discriminative between individuals with and without ASD across the lifespan, whereas between-group differences in looking at activities may shift with development. These findings may have applications in the search for underlying biological indicators specific to ASD. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02668991.", "Surgical residents have been shown to experience high rates of burnout. Whether this is influenced predominately by intrinsic characteristics, external factors, or is multifactorial has not been well studied. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between these elements and burnout. We hypothesized that residents with higher emotional intelligence scores, greater resilience and mindfulness, and better work environments would experience lower rates of burnout.\nGeneral surgery residents at 7 sites in the US were invited to complete an electronic survey in 2019 that included the 2-item Maslach Burnout Inventory, Brief Emotional Intelligence Scale, Revised Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale, 2-Item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and Job Resources scale of the Job Demands-Resources Questionnaire. Individual constructs were assessed for association with burnout, using multivariable logistic regression models. Residents' scores were evaluated in aggregate, in groups according to demographic characteristics, and by site.\nOf 284 residents, 164 completed the survey (response rate 58%). A total of 71% of respondents were at high risk for burnout, with sites ranging from 57% to 85% (p\u202f=\u202f0.49). Burnout rates demonstrated no significant difference across gender, PGY level, and respondent age. On bivariate model, no demographic variables were found to be associated with burnout, but the internal characteristics of emotional intelligence, resilience and mindfulness, and the external characteristics of work engagement and job resources were each found to be protective against burnout (p < 0.001 for all). However, multivariable models examining internal and external characteristics found that no internal characteristics were associated with burnout, while job resources (coeff. -1.0, p-value <0.001) and work engagement (coeff. -0.76, p-value 0.032) were significantly protective factors. Rates of engagement overall were high, particularly with respect to work \"dedication.\"\nA majority of residents at multiple institutions were at high risk for burnout during the study period. Improved work engagement and job resources were found to be more strongly associated with decreased burnout rates when compared to internal characteristics. Although surgical residents appear to already be highly engaged in their work, programs should continue to explore ways to increase job resources, and further research should be aimed at elucidating the mediating effect of internal characteristics on these external factors.", "Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed malignancy. It causes significant mortality and morbidity, which can be reduced by early diagnosis with an effective screening test. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and computer-aided detection (CAD) with screening methods has shown promising colorectal cancer screening results. AI could provide a \"second look\" for endoscopists to decrease the rate of missed polyps during a colonoscopy. It can also improve detection and characterization of polyps by integration with colonoscopy and various advanced endoscopic modalities such as magnifying narrow-band imaging, endocytoscopy, confocal endomicroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy, and magnifying chromoendoscopy. This descriptive review discusses various AI and CAD applications in colorectal cancer screening, polyp detection, and characterization.", "Predictive analysis can be used to evaluate the enormous data generated by the healthcare industry to extract information and establish relationships amongst the variables. It uses artificial intelligence to reveal associations not suspected by the healthcare professionals. Tobacco cessation is clearly beneficial; however, many tobacco users respond differently as it is based on multitude of factors. Our objectives were to assess the data mining techniques using the WEKA tool, evaluate its role in predictive analysis, and to predict the quit status of patients using prediction algorithms in tobacco cessation.\nWEKA, a data mining tool, was used to classify the data and evaluate them using 10-fold cross-validations. The various algorithms used in this tool are Na\u00efve Bayes, SMO, Random Forest, J-48, and Decision Stump to further analyze its role in determining the quit status of patients. For this, secondary data of 655 patients from a tobacco cessation clinic were utilized and described using 20 different attributes for prediction of quit status.\nThe Decision Stump and SMO were found to be having the best prediction and accuracy for prediction of the quit status. Out of 20 attributes, previous quitting attempt, type of intervention, and number of years since the habit was initiated were found to be associated with early quitting rate.\nThis study concluded that data mining and predictive analytical models like WEKA tool will not only improve patient outcomes but identify variables or a combination of variables for effective interventions in tobacco cessation.", "Frailty is a reduced capacity to recover from a physiologically stressful event. It is well established that preoperative frailty is associated with poor postoperative outcomes, but it is unclear if this includes cognitive decline following anesthesia and surgery. This retrospective observational study was a secondary analysis of data from a previous study (the Anaesthesia, Cognition, Evaluation [ACE] study). We aimed to identify if preoperative frailty or prefrailty is associated with preoperative and postoperative neurocognitive disorders or postoperative cognitive dysfunction.\nThe ACE study enrolled 300 participants aged \u226560 scheduled for elective total hip joint replacement and who underwent a full neuropsychological assessment at baseline and 3 and 12 months postoperatively. We applied patient data to 2 frailty models; both were based on an accumulation of deficits score: the reported Edmonton frail scale (REFS) and the comprehensive geriatric assessment-frailty index (CGA-FI) based on the comprehensive geriatric assessment. We calculated these 2 scores using baseline data collected from the medical history, demographic and clinical data as well as self-reported questionnaires. Some items on the REFS (3 of 18 or 17%) and the CGA-FI (37 of 51 or 27%) did not have an equivalent item in the ACE data.\nThe mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 70.1 years (6.6) with more women (197 [66%]). Using the REFS model, 40 of 300 (13.3%) patients were classified as vulnerable, mild, or moderately frail. Using the CGA-FI model, 69 of 300 (23%) were classified as intermediate or high frailty. The REFS and the CGA-FI were strongly correlated (r = 0.75; P < .01) with 34 of 300 (11%) meeting criteria for frailty by both the REFS and the CGA-FI.Frailty or prefrailty was associated with cognitive decline at 3 and 12 months using the REFS (odds ratio [OR], 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.23 and OR, 2.00, 95% CI, 1.26-3.17, respectively) after adjusting for baseline mini-mental state examination (MMSE), smoking, hypertension, diabetes, history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and estimated intelligence quotient (IQ). Age did not modify this association. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, 3-month cognitive decline was no longer significantly associated with baseline frailty.\nThis retrospective analysis demonstrates an association between baseline frailty and postoperative neurocognitive disorders, particularly using the more extensive REFS scoring method. This supports preoperative screening for frailty to risk-stratify patients, and identify and implement preventive strategies and to improve postoperative outcomes for older individuals.", "Background Recognition of salient MRI morphologic and kinetic features of various malignant tumor subtypes and benign diseases, either visually or with artificial intelligence (AI), allows radiologists to improve diagnoses that may improve patient treatment. Purpose To evaluate whether the diagnostic performance of radiologists in the differentiation of cancer from noncancer at dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) breast MRI is improved when using an AI system compared with conventionally available software. Materials and Methods In a retrospective clinical reader study, images from breast DCE MRI examinations were interpreted by 19 breast imaging radiologists from eight academic and 11 private practices. Readers interpreted each examination twice. In the \"first read,\" they were provided with conventionally available computer-aided evaluation software, including kinetic maps. In the \"second read,\" they were also provided with AI analytics through computer-aided diagnosis software. Reader diagnostic performance was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a figure of merit in the task of distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. The primary study end point was the difference in AUC between the first-read and the second-read conditions. Results One hundred eleven women (mean age, 52 years \u00b1 13 [standard deviation]) were evaluated with a total of 111 breast DCE MRI examinations (54 malignant and 57 nonmalignant lesions). The average AUC of all readers improved from 0.71 to 0.76 (P = .04) when using the AI system. The average sensitivity improved when Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 was used as the cut point (from 90% to 94%; 95% confidence interval [CI] for the change: 0.8%, 7.4%) but not when using BI-RADS category 4a (from 80% to 85%; 95% CI: -0.9%, 11%). The average specificity showed no difference when using either BI-RADS category 4a or category 3 as the cut point (52% and 52% [95% CI: -7.3%, 6.0%], and from 29% to 28% [95% CI: -6.4%, 4.3%], respectively). Conclusion Use of an artificial intelligence system improves radiologists' performance in the task of differentiating benign and malignant MRI breast lesions. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Krupinski in this issue.", "Polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene have been associated with individual differences in cognition, brain structure and brain function. For example, the \u03b54 allele has been associated with cognitive and brain impairment in old age and increased risk of dementia, while the \u03b52 allele has been claimed to be neuroprotective. According to the 'antagonistic pleiotropy' hypothesis, these polymorphisms have different effects across the lifespan, with \u03b54, for example, postulated to confer benefits on cognitive and brain functions earlier in life. In this stage 2 of the Registered Report - https://osf.io/bufc4, we report the results from the cognitive and brain measures in the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience cohort (www.cam-can.org). We investigated the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis by testing for allele-by-age interactions in approximately 600 people across the adult lifespan (18-88\u2009years), on six outcome variables related to cognition, brain structure and brain function (namely, fluid intelligence, verbal memory, hippocampal grey-matter volume, mean diffusion within white matter and resting-state connectivity measured by both functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography). We found no evidence to support the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis. Indeed, Bayes factors supported the null hypothesis in all cases, except for the (linear) interaction between age and possession of the \u03b54 allele on fluid intelligence, for which the evidence for faster decline in older ages was ambiguous. Overall, these pre-registered analyses question the antagonistic pleiotropy of APOE polymorphisms, at least in healthy adults.", "Early screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) with an efficient and scalable method is highly needed to reduce blindness, due to the growing epidemic of diabetes. The aim of the study was to validate an artificial intelligence-enabled DR screening and to investigate the prevalence of DR in adult patients with diabetes in China.\nThe study was prospectively conducted at 155 diabetes centers in China. A non-mydriatic, macula-centered fundus photograph per eye was collected and graded through a deep learning (DL)-based, five-stage DR classification. Images from a randomly selected one-third of participants were used for the DL algorithm validation.\nIn total, 47 269 patients (mean (SD) age, 54.29 (11.60) years) were enrolled. 15 805 randomly selected participants were reviewed by a panel of specialists for DL algorithm validation. The DR grading algorithms had a 83.3% (95% CI: 81.9% to 84.6%) sensitivity and a 92.5% (95% CI: 92.1% to 92.9%) specificity to detect referable DR. The five-stage DR classification performance (concordance: 83.0%) is comparable to the interobserver variability of specialists (concordance: 84.3%). The estimated prevalence in patients with diabetes detected by DL algorithm for any DR, referable DR and vision-threatening DR were 28.8% (95% CI: 28.4% to 29.3%), 24.4% (95% CI: 24.0% to 24.8%) and 10.8% (95% CI: 10.5% to 11.1%), respectively. The prevalence was higher in female, elderly, longer diabetes duration and higher glycated hemoglobin groups.\nThis study performed, a nationwide, multicenter, DL-based DR screening and the results indicated the importance and feasibility of DR screening in clinical practice with this system deployed at diabetes centers.\nNCT04240652.", "The integration of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, known as ANFIS, is investigated for simulating the hydrodynamic in a bubble column reactor. The Eulerian-Eulerian two-phase model is employed as the CFD approach. For the ANFIS technique, a sensitivity analysis is done by varying the number of inputs and the number of membership functions (MFs). The x and z coordinates of the fluid location, the air velocity, and the pressure are considered as the inputs of the ANFIS, while the air vorticity is the output. The results revealed that the ANFIS with all four inputs and the MFs of five achieved the highest intelligence with the regression number close to 1. More specifically, gbell function in the learning framework is used to train all local computing nodes from solving Navier-Stokes equations. In the decision or prediction part, the fuzzy mechanism is used for the prediction of extra nodes that solve, which Navier-Stokes equations did not solve. The results show that the gbell function enables us to fully train all numerical points and also store data set in the frame of mathematical equations. Besides, this function responds well with the number of inputs and MFs for accurate prediction of reactor hydrodynamics. Additionally, a high number of MFs and input parameters influence the accuracy of the method during prediction. In the current study, gbell MF was studied to investigate its accuracy in the prediction of the two-phase flow. Also, different numbers of MFs were considered to investigate the level of accuracy and capability of prediction. ANFIS clustering methods, grid partition and fuzzy C-mean (FCM) clustering, are compared to see the ability of the method in prediction. To compare the accuracy of the ANFIS method with FCM clustering, the data were compared to the gaussmf function. The results showed that the method has high accuracy and that it could predict the flow pattern.", "Research on cognitive ability is done in different paradigms. In the Piagetian paradigm, cognitive ability focuses on cognitive development along qualitative stages. Interactive real scenarios, \"Piagetian tasks\", are constructed for measurement. According to age, tasks differing in complexity are applied in individual measurements. In the psychometric paradigm, the investigation of cognitive ability focuses on individual differences. Intelligence is seen as a quantitative construct with gradual differences between persons and ages. Paper-and-pencil tests with items differing in difficulty are used for IQ measurement of single persons or school classes. However, do those tasks measure two distinct cognitive abilities? Solving tasks in both approaches requires basic (speed, working memory) and complex cognitive abilities (reasoning, understanding). Regarding empirical relationships, we used three Austrian samples (in kindergarten four to six years old N\u2009=\u200940, in primary school six to eight years old N\u2009=\u200940, and nine to ten years old N\u2009=\u200941). They were tested with psychometric tests (Raven CPM or SPM) and Piagetian tasks. In addition, mental speed (ZVT) was measured in the two school samples. The average observed correlation between IQ and Piagetian tasks was r\u2009=\u2009.51. In factor analyses, the tests loaded on a common factor of general intelligence. Further analyses revealed that mental speed is correlated more strongly with psychometric (r\u2009=\u2009.50) than with Piagetian tasks (r\u2009=\u2009.39), while Piagetian tasks are more related to parental education indicators (speed: r\u2009=\u2009.11, Raven: r\u2009=\u2009.20, Piaget: r\u2009=\u2009.25).", "Duplications of chromosome 16p11.2, even though rare in the general population, are one of the most frequent known genetic causes of autism spectrum disorder and of other neurodevelopmental disorders. However, data about the neuro-behavioral phenotype of these patients are few. We described a sample of children with duplication of chromosome 16p11.2 focusing on the neuro-behavioral phenotype. The five patients reported presented with very heterogeneous conditions as for characteristics and severity, ranging from a learning disorder in a child with normal intelligence quotient to an autism spectrum disorder associated with an intellectual disability. Our case report underlines the wide heterogeneity of the neuropsychiatric phenotypes associated with a duplication of chromosome 16p11.2. Similarly to other copy number variations that are considered pathogenic, the wide variability of phenotype of chromosome 16p11.2 duplication is probably related to additional risk factors, both genetic and not genetic, often difficult to identify and most likely different from case to case.", "There is clear agreement about the importance of promoting emotional intelligence in school through programs integrated in the academic curriculum. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of the EDI program on the emotional intelligence trait and on general academic performance, as well as mathematics and language performance. The participants were 5th grade elementary school students between 10 and 11 years old. A quasi-experimental repeated-measures design was used, with a comparison group and four assessment points. The results showed, on the one hand, the effectiveness of a two-year intervention in improving emotional intelligence and, on the other hand, its positive influence on academic performance in general, and specifically on mathematics and language performance. In the non-intervention group, general academic performance and language performance declined. The results are discussed, and recommendations are made for future interventions.", "A digital medical health system named Tianxia120 that can provide patients and hospitals with \"one-step service\" is proposed in this paper. Evolving from the techniques of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), medical dig data, and medical Artificial Intelligence, the system can systematically promote the change of service status between doctors and patients from \"passive mode\" to \"proactive mode\" and realize online service that is similar to offline medical treatment scenarios. The system consists of a patient terminal and a doctor terminal. They can perform online inquiry (through graphic, voice, telephone, video, etc.), electronic prescription, multiparameter self-diagnosis, cold chain logistics, medicine distribution, etc. The system can provide rich medical health information, medical tools browsing, and health care big data aggregation processing functions. Compared with the traditional medical system, this system has the characteristics of full function, rich data, and high security. It is expected to be applied to hospital applications and medical research to promote the construction and innovation of clinical medical disciplines.", "Low frequency vibration monitoring has significant implications on environmental safety and engineering practices. Vibration expressed by visual information should contain sufficient spatial information. RGB-D camera could record diverse spatial information of vibration in frame images. Deep learning can adaptively transform frame images into deep abstract features through nonlinear mapping, which is an effective method to improve the intelligence of vibration monitoring. In this paper, a multi-modal low frequency visual vibration monitoring system based on Kinect v2 and 3DCNN-ConvLSTM is proposed. Microsoft Kinect v2 collects RGB and depth video information of vibrating objects in unstable ambient light. The 3DCNN-ConvLSTM architecture can effectively learn the spatial-temporal characteristics of muti-frequency vibration. The short-term spatiotemporal feature of the collected vibration information is learned through 3D convolution networks and the long-term spatiotemporal feature is learned through convolutional LSTM. Multi-modal fusion of RGB and depth mode is used to further improve the monitoring accuracy to 93% in the low frequency vibration range of 0-10 Hz. The results show that the system can monitor low frequency vibration and meet the basic measurement requirements.", "Metabolic engineering aims to maximize the production of bio-economically important substances (compounds, enzymes, or other proteins) through the optimization of the genetics, cellular processes and growth conditions of microorganisms. This requires detailed understanding of underlying metabolic pathways involved in the production of the targeted substances, and how the cellular processes or growth conditions are regulated by the engineering. To achieve this goal, a large system of experimental techniques, compound libraries, computational methods and data resources, including multi-omics data, are used. The recent advent of multi-omics systems biology approaches significantly impacted the field by opening new avenues to perform dynamic and large-scale analyses that deepen our knowledge on the manipulations. However, with the enormous transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics available, it is a daunting task to integrate the data for a more holistic understanding. Novel data mining and analytics approaches, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), can provide breakthroughs where traditional low-throughput experiment-alone methods cannot easily achieve. Here, we review the latest attempts of combining systems biology and AI in metabolic engineering research, and highlight how this alliance can help overcome the current challenges facing industrial biotechnology, especially for food-related substances and compounds using microorganisms.", "Dermatological diagnosis remains challenging for nonspecialists because the morphologies of primary skin lesions widely vary from patient to patient. Although previous studies have used artificial intelligence (AI) to classify lesions as benign or malignant, there have not been extensive studies examining the use of AI on identifying and categorizing a primary skin lesion's morphology. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a standalone AI tool to correctly categorize a skin lesion's morphology from a test bank of images. To provide a marker of performance, we evaluate the accuracy of primary care physicians to categorize skin lesion morphology in the same test bank of images without any aids and then with the aid of a simple visual guide. The AI system achieved an accuracy of 68% in determining the single most likely morphology from the test image bank. When the AI's top prediction was broadened to its top three most likely predictions, accuracy improved to 80%. In comparison, the diagnostic accuracy of primary care physicians was 36% without any aids and 68% with the visual guide (P < 0.001). The AI was subsequently tested on an additional set of 222 heterogeneous images of varying Fitzpatrick skin types and achieved an overall accuracy of 70% in the Fitzpatrick I-III skin type group and 68% in the Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin type group (P\u00a0= 0.79). An AI is a powerful tool to assist physicians in the diagnosis of skin lesions while still requiring the user to critically consider other possible diagnoses.", "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a lack of social communication and social interaction. Autism is a mental disorder investigated by social and computational intelligence scientists utilizing advanced technologies such as machine learning models to enhance clinicians' ability to provide robust diagnosis and prognosis of autism. However, with dynamic changes in autism behaviour patterns, these models' quality and accuracy have become a great challenge for clinical practitioners. We applied a deep neural network learning on a large brain image dataset obtained from ABIDE (autism brain imaging data exchange) to provide an efficient diagnosis of ASD, especially for children. Our deep learning model combines unsupervised neural network learning, an autoencoder, and supervised deep learning using convolutional neural networks. Our proposed algorithm outperforms individual-based classifiers measured by various validations and assessment measures. Experimental results indicate that the autoencoder combined with the convolution neural networks provides the best performance by achieving 84.05% accuracy and Area under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.78.", "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted numerous medical specialties with high emphasis on radiology. Associated novel diagnostic methods have become a rapidly emerging hot topic, and it is essential to provide insights into quantitative analysis of the growing literature. Purpose The purpose of this study is to highlight future academic trends, identify potential research gaps, and analyze scientific landscape of AI in the field of medicine. The main aim is to explore comprehensive dataset over a 46-year period in terms of publication type, publication citation, country of origin, institution, and medical specialty. Material and Methods The Web of Science database was searched from 1975 to 2020, and publications on AI were explored. Both original research reports and review articles were included in comprehensive bibliometric analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and numerous variables were applied, namely year of publication, institution, type of publication, specialty area, country of origin, and citation numbers, and the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance was used. Results A total of 117,974 relevant citations were retrieved, of which 83,979 original research and review articles were retained for analysis. Not surprisingly, the largest proportion of citations were from the United States (23%, n = 19,180) followed by China, Spain, England, and Germany. The number of citations was relatively consistent during the 1970s and emerging gradually during the 1980s. However, ongoing scientific trend positively evolved, and the numbers started to grow significantly in the 1990s and demonstrated continuous increasing wave since then. The most frequently represented key medical specialties were oncology, radiology, neuroradiology, and ophthalmology. Overall, no major statistical difference was found between these four domains (p = 0.753). Conclusions In summary, research on AI-powered technologies in the medical domain was at early stage in the 1970s.\u00a0However, associated deep learning algorithms significantly attracted and revolutionized the scientific community with subsequent evolution of research and exponential growth of multidisciplinary publications since that time. Work in this field has impacted radiology as an area of predominant interest and has been led by institutions in the United States, Spain, France, China, and England. The bibliometric study reported herein can provide a broad overview and valuable guidance to help medical researchers gain insights into key points and trace the global trends regarding the status of AI research in medicine, particularly in radiology and other relevant multispecialty areas.", "The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to global health and healthcare crisis, apart from the tremendous socioeconomic effects. One of the significant challenges in this crisis is to identify and monitor the COVID-19 patients quickly and efficiently to facilitate timely decisions for their treatment, monitoring, and management. Research efforts are on to develop less time-consuming methods to replace or to supplement RT-PCR-based methods. The present study is aimed at creating efficient deep learning models, trained with chest X-ray images, for rapid screening of COVID-19 patients. We used publicly available PA chest X-ray images of adult COVID-19 patients for the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based classification models for COVID-19 and other major infectious diseases. To increase the dataset size and develop generalized models, we performed 25 different types of augmentations on the original images. Furthermore, we utilized the transfer learning approach for the training and testing of the classification models. The combination of two best-performing models (each trained on 286 images, rotated through 120\u00b0 or 140\u00b0 angle) displayed the highest prediction accuracy for normal, COVID-19, non-COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis images. AI-based classification models trained through the transfer learning approach can efficiently classify the chest X-ray images representing studied diseases. Our method is more efficient than previously published methods. It is one step ahead towards the implementation of AI-based methods for classification problems in biomedical imaging related to COVID-19.", "Healthcare has already been impacted by the fourth industrial revolution exemplified by tip of spear technology, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Yet, there is much to be accomplished as systems remain suboptimal, and full interoperability of digital records is not realized. Given the footprint of technology in healthcare, the field of clinical immunology will certainly see improvements related to these tools.\nBiomedical informatics spans the gamut of technology in biomedicine. Within this distinct field, advances are being made, which allow for engineering of systems to automate disease detection, create computable phenotypes and improve record portability. Within clinical immunology, technologies are emerging along these lines and are expected to continue.\nThis review highlights advancements in digital health including learning health systems, electronic phenotyping, artificial intelligence and use of registries. Technological advancements for improving diagnosis and care of patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases is also highlighted.", "This article reports how 18 UK and Canadian population health artificial intelligence researchers in Higher Education Institutions perceive the use of artificial intelligence systems in their research, and how this compares with their perceptions about the media portrayal of artificial intelligence systems. This is triangulated with a small scoping analysis of how UK and Canadian news articles portray artificial intelligence systems associated with health research and care. Interviewees had concerns about what they perceived as sensationalist reporting of artificial intelligence systems - a finding reflected in the media analysis. In line with Pickersgill's concept of 'epistemic modesty', they considered artificial intelligence systems better perceived as non-exceptionalist methodological tools that were uncertain and unexciting. Adopting 'epistemic modesty' was sometimes hindered by stakeholders to whom the research is disseminated, who may be less interested in hearing about the uncertainties of scientific practice, having implications on both research and policy.", "The ability to encode and manipulate data structures with distributed neural representations could qualitatively enhance the capabilities of traditional neural networks by supporting rule-based symbolic reasoning, a central property of cognition. Here we show how this may be accomplished within the framework of Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) (Plate, 1991; Gayler, 1998; Kanerva, 1996), whereby data structures are encoded by combining high-dimensional vectors with operations that together form an algebra on the space of distributed representations. In particular, we propose an efficient solution to a hard combinatorial search problem that arises when decoding elements of a VSA data structure: the factorization of products of multiple codevectors. Our proposed algorithm, called a resonator network, is a new type of recurrent neural network that interleaves VSA multiplication operations and pattern completion. We show in two examples-parsing of a tree-like data structure and parsing of a visual scene-how the factorization problem arises and how the resonator network can solve it. More broadly, resonator networks open the possibility of applying VSAs to myriad artificial intelligence problems in real-world domains. The companion article in this issue (Kent, Frady, Sommer, & Olshausen, 2020) presents a rigorous analysis and evaluation of the performance of resonator networks, showing it outperforms alternative approaches.", "Gastric cancer (GC), one of the most common cancers around the world, is a multifactorial disease and there are many risk factors for this disease. Assessing the risk of GC is essential for choosing an appropriate healthcare strategy. There have been very few studies conducted on the development of risk assessment systems for GC. This study is aimed at providing a medical decision support system based on soft computing using fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) which will help healthcare professionals to decide on an appropriate individual healthcare strategy based on the risk level of the disease. FCMs are considered as one of the strongest artificial intelligence techniques for complex system modeling. In this system, an FCM based on Nonlinear Hebbian Learning (NHL) algorithm is used. The data used in this study are collected from the medical records of 560 patients referring to Imam Reza Hospital in Tabriz City. 27 effective features in gastric cancer were selected using the opinions of three experts. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method is 95.83%. The results show that the proposed method is more accurate than other decision-making algorithms, such as decision trees, Na\u00efve Bayes, and ANN. From the perspective of healthcare professionals, the proposed medical decision support system is simple, comprehensive, and more effective than previous models for assessing the risk of GC and can help them to predict the risk factors for GC in the clinical setting.", "To develop a deep learning model that generates consistent, high-quality lymph node clinical target volumes (CTV) contours for head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, as an integral part of a fully automated radiation treatment planning workflow.\nComputed tomography (CT) scans from 71 HNC patients were retrospectively collected and split into training (n = 51), cross-validation (n = 10), and test (n = 10) data sets. All had target volume delineations covering lymph node levels Ia through V (Ia-V), Ib through V (Ib-V), II through IV (II-IV), and retropharyngeal (RP) nodes, which were previously approved by a radiation oncologist specializing in HNC. Volumes of interest (VOIs) about nodal levels were automatically identified using computer vision techniques. The VOI (cropped CT image) and approved contours were used to train a U-Net autosegmentation model. Each lymph node level was trained independently, with model parameters optimized by assessing performance on the cross-validation data set. Once optimal model parameters were identified, overlap and distance metrics were calculated between ground truth and autosegmentations on the test set. Lastly, this final model was used on 32 additional patient scans (not included in original 71 cases) and autosegmentations visually rated by 3 radiation oncologists as being \"clinically acceptable without requiring edits,\" \"requiring minor edits,\" or \"requiring major edits.\"\nWhen comparing ground truths to autosegmentations on the test data set, median Dice Similarity Coefficients were 0.90, 0.90, 0.89, and 0.81, and median mean surface distance values were 1.0 mm, 1.0 mm, 1.1 mm, and 1.3 mm for node levels Ia-V, Ib-V, II-IV, and RP nodes, respectively. Qualitative scoring varied among physicians. Overall, 99% of autosegmented target volumes were either scored as being clinically acceptable or requiring minor edits (ie, stylistic recommendations, <2 minutes).\nWe developed a fully automated artificial intelligence approach to autodelineate nodal CTVs for patients with intact HNC. Most autosegmentations were found to be clinically acceptable after qualitative review when considering recommended stylistic edits. This promising work automatically delineates nodal CTVs in a robust and consistent manner; this approach can be implemented in ongoing efforts for fully automated radiation treatment planning.", "The database here described contains data relevant to preterm infants' movement acquired in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The data consists of 16 depth videos recorded during the actual clinical practice. Each video consists of 1000 frames (i.e., 100s). The dataset was acquired at the NICU of the Salesi Hospital, Ancona (Italy). Each frame was annotated with the limb-joint location. Twelve joints were annotated, i.e., left and right shoul- der, elbow, wrist, hip, knee and ankle. The database is freely accessible at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3891404. This dataset represents a unique resource for artificial intelligence researchers that want to develop algorithms to provide healthcare professionals working in NICUs with decision support. Hence, the babyPose dataset is the first annotated dataset of depth images relevant to preterm infants' movement analysis.", "Addressing the global decline of coral reefs requires effective actions from managers, policymakers and society as a whole. Coral reef scientists are therefore challenged with the task of providing prompt and relevant inputs for science-based decision-making. Here, we provide a baseline dataset, covering 1300\u2009km of tropical coral reef habitats globally, and comprised of over one million geo-referenced, high-resolution photo-quadrats analysed using artificial intelligence to automatically estimate the proportional cover of benthic components. The dataset contains information on five major reef regions, and spans 2012-2018, including surveys before and after the 2016 global bleaching event. The taxonomic resolution attained by image analysis, as well as the spatially explicit nature of the images, allow for multi-scale spatial analyses, temporal assessments (decline and recovery), and serve for supporting image recognition developments. This standardised dataset across broad geographies offers a significant contribution towards a sound baseline for advancing our understanding of coral reef ecology and thereby taking collective and informed actions to mitigate catastrophic losses in coral reefs worldwide.", "Systematic reviews often require substantial resources, partially due to the large number of records identified during searching. Although artificial intelligence may not be ready to fully replace human reviewers, it may accelerate and reduce the screening burden. Using DistillerSR (May 2020 release), we evaluated the performance of the prioritization simulation tool to determine the reduction in screening burden and time savings.\nUsing a true recall @ 95%, response sets from 10 completed systematic reviews were used to evaluate: (i) the reduction of screening burden; (ii) the accuracy of the prioritization algorithm; and (iii) the hours saved when a modified screening approach was implemented. To account for variation in the simulations, and to introduce randomness (through shuffling the references), 10 simulations were run for each review. Means, standard deviations, medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) are presented.\nAmong the 10 systematic reviews, using true recall @ 95% there was a median reduction in screening burden of 47.1% (IQR: 37.5 to 58.0%). A median of 41.2% (IQR: 33.4 to 46.9%) of the excluded records needed to be screened to achieve true recall @ 95%. The median title/abstract screening hours saved using a modified screening approach at a true recall @ 95% was 29.8\u2009h (IQR: 28.1 to 74.7\u2009h). This was increased to a median of 36\u2009h (IQR: 32.2 to 79.7\u2009h) when considering the time saved not retrieving and screening full texts of the remaining 5% of records not yet identified as included at title/abstract. Among the 100 simulations (10 simulations per review), none of these 5% of records were a final included study in the systematic review. The reduction in screening burden to achieve true recall @ 95% compared to @ 100% resulted in a reduced screening burden median of 40.6% (IQR: 38.3 to 54.2%).\nThe prioritization tool in DistillerSR can reduce screening burden. A modified or stop screening approach once a true recall @ 95% is achieved appears to be a valid method for rapid reviews, and perhaps systematic reviews. This needs to be further evaluated in prospective reviews using the estimated recall.", "Algorithms and information processing, fundamental to biological system, are an essential aspect of many elementary physical phenomena, such as molecular self-assembly. Self-assembly system has been proved to be capable of performing many logic operations by the early work. A significant challenge related to the design of molecular information processing systems is to develop a programmable architecture that controls the states of individual molecular events. Here, a novel systematic implementation of logical inference is presented based on DNA tile assembly system. Exploiting the intrinsic programmable capability of molecular interactions, firstly a seed tile configuration is constructed to encode the input information of a logical inference problem, including all facts, all inference rules and their equivalent rules. Then, three tile assembly subsystems are discussed to fulfil the main logical deduction steps. We describe mechanisms for finding the successful solutions among the many parallel assemblies. A whole tile assembly system is established on the base of a seed configuration and three subsystems. This prototype is the first programming language to implement deduction operations based on two-dimensional DNA assembly. It is demonstrated that algorithmic DNA tile assembly system can be treated as an important way to implement logic inference, which will shed light on aspects of applications in the field of artificial intelligence in the future.", "The Special Issue (SI) \"Remote Sensing in Vessel Detection and Navigation\" highlighted a variety of topics related to remote sensing with navigational sensors.

Novel quantitative assessments of myocardial viability, microcalcification and in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and cardiac amyloidosis will also be described. Lastly, we will review the potential role for artificial intelligence to improve image analysis, disease diagnosis, and risk prediction. The potential clinical role for all these novel techniques will be highlighted as well as methods to optimize their implementation.", "Achieving military mission objectives requires high levels of performance from Airmen who operate under extreme physical and cognitive demands. Thus, there is a critical need to establish scientific interventions to enhance physical fitness and cognitive performance-promoting the resilience of Airmen and aiding in mission success. We therefore conducted a comprehensive, 12-week randomized controlled trial in active-duty Air Force Airmen (n\u2009=\u2009148) to compare the efficacy of a multimodal intervention comprised of high-intensity interval aerobic fitness and strength training paired with a novel nutritional supplement [comprised of \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB), lutein, phospholipids, DHA and selected micronutrients including B12 and folic acid] to high-intensity interval aerobic fitness and strength training paired with a standard of care placebo beverage. The exercise intervention alone improved several dimensions of physical fitness [strength and endurance (+\u00a08.3%), power (+\u00a00.85%), mobility and stability (+\u200922%), heart rate (-\u20091.1%) and lean muscle mass (+\u20091.4%)] and cognitive function [(episodic memory (+\u20099.5%), processing efficiency (+\u20097.5%), executive function reaction time (-\u20094.8%) and fluid intelligence accuracy (+\u200919.5%)]. Relative to exercise training alone, the multimodal fitness and nutritional intervention further improved working memory (+\u20099.0%), fluid intelligence reaction time (-\u20097.7%), processing efficiency (+\u20091.8%), heart rate (-\u20092.4%) and lean muscle mass (+\u20091.5%). These findings establish the efficacy of a multimodal intervention that incorporates aerobic fitness and strength training with a novel nutritional supplement to enhance military performance objectives and to provide optimal exercise training and nutritional support for the modern warfighter.", "Footwear marks are one of the most frequently encountered evidence types recovered from a crime scene and can provide valuable scene intelligence regarding potential suspects. It has been acknowledged that impressions of footwear and tools can be recovered from graves, but previous studies have only focused on tool mark recovery. This has led to a lack of published information regarding footwear mark recovery from graves. It is therefore important to demonstrate whether the recovery of footwear marks is feasible and, if so, under what conditions this can be achieved. To address recovery, this study, placed 60 three dimensional (3D) impressions of footwear marks within 60 simulated graves. This was done to assess time (1, 2, 4\u00a0months) and at known depths (20, 30, 40\u00a0cm). The footwear marks within the graves were covered with clothing or left uncovered. The shoe's design patterns were grouped and counted in a photographic comparison between the 3D footwear impressions, placed within the test-pits, and any recovered impressions. A grading system was adapted by the authors to score the quality of footwear impressions observed during recovery. The results demonstrate that the preservation and recovery of footwear impressions from graves is feasible. The simulated graves covered with clothing showed better preservation of footwear impressions, but there was no clear evidence that time or depth had an effect. The authors note that careful consideration and vigilant excavation skills are needed when excavating graves which may bear potential footwear marks, as their recovery will lead to an increased amount of intelligence that can link suspects to homicide scenes.", "To determine the extent and disclosure of financial ties to industry and use of scientific evidence in comments on a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory framework for modifications to artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based software as a medical device (SaMD).\nCross-sectional study.\nWe searched all publicly available comments on the FDA 'Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)-Discussion Paper and Request for Feedback' from 2 April 2019 to 8 August 2019.\nThe proportion of articles submitted by parties with financial ties to industry, disclosing those ties, citing scientific articles, citing systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and using a systematic process to identify relevant literature.\nWe analysed 125 comments submitted on the proposed framework. 79 (63%) comments came from parties with financial ties; for 36 (29%) comments, it was not clear and the absence of financial ties could only be confirmed for 10 (8%) comments. No financial ties were disclosed in any of the comments that were not from industry submitters. The vast majority of submitted comments (86%) did not cite any scientific literature, just 4% cited a systematic review or meta-analysis and no comments indicated that a systematic process was used to identify relevant literature.\nFinancial ties to industry were common and undisclosed, and scientific evidence, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, were rarely cited. To ensure regulatory frameworks best serve patient interests, the FDA should mandate disclosure of potential conflicts of interest (including financial ties) in comments, encourage the use of scientific evidence, and encourage engagement from non-conflicted parties.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken us by storm, helping us to make decisions in everything we do, even in finding our \"true love\" and the \"significant other\". While 5G promises us high-speed mobile internet, 6G pledges to support ubiquitous AI services through next-generation softwarization, heterogeneity, and configurability of networks. The work on 6G is in its infancy and requires the community to conceptualize and develop its design, implementation, deployment, and use cases. Towards this end, this paper proposes a framework for Distributed AI as a Service (DAIaaS) provisioning for Internet of Everything (IoE) and 6G environments. The AI service is \"distributed\" because the actual training and inference computations are divided into smaller, concurrent, computations suited to the level and capacity of resources available with cloud, fog, and edge layers. Multiple DAIaaS provisioning configurations for distributed training and inference are proposed to investigate the design choices and performance bottlenecks of DAIaaS. Specifically, we have developed three case studies (e.g., smart airport) with eight scenarios (e.g., federated learning) comprising nine applications and AI delivery models (smart surveillance, etc.) and 50 distinct sensor and software modules (e.g., object tracker). The evaluation of the case studies and the DAIaaS framework is reported in terms of end-to-end delay, network usage, energy consumption, and financial savings with recommendations to achieve higher performance. DAIaaS will facilitate standardization of distributed AI provisioning, allow developers to focus on the domain-specific details without worrying about distributed training and inference, and help systemize the mass-production of technologies for smarter environments.", "Prediction of the groundwater nitrate concentration is of utmost importance for pollution control and water resource management. This research aims to model the spatial groundwater nitrate concentration in the Marvdasht watershed, Iran, based on several artificial intelligence methods of support vector machine (SVM), Cubist, random forest (RF), and Bayesian artificial neural network (Baysia-ANN) machine learning models. For this purpose, 11 independent variables affecting groundwater nitrate changes include elevation, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, rainfall, piezometric depth, distance from the river, distance from residential, Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), and topographic wetness index (TWI) in the study area were prepared. Nitrate levels were also measured in 67 wells and used as a dependent variable for modeling. Data were divided into two categories of training (70%) and testing (30%) for modeling. The evaluation criteria coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the models used. The results of modeling the susceptibility of groundwater nitrate concentration showed that the RF (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 4.24, NSE = 0.87) model is better than the other Cubist (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 5.18, NSE = 0.81), SVM (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 6.07, NSE = 0.74), Bayesian-ANN (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 5.91, NSE = 0.75) models. The results of groundwater nitrate concentration zoning in the study area showed that the northern parts of the case study have the highest amount of nitrate, which is higher in these agricultural areas than in other areas. The most important cause of nitrate pollution in these areas is agriculture activities and the use of groundwater to irrigate these crops and the wells close to agricultural areas, which has led to the indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers by irrigation or rainwater of these fertilizers is washed and penetrates groundwater and pollutes the aquifer.", "Huntington's disease (HD) is a heritable degenerative brain disease caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene with excessive repeats of the base triplet cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG), which codes for the aminoacid glutamine. HD is associated with a broad spectrum of neurocognitive dysfunction, including deficits in social cognition. The appreciation of fairness rules and reciprocity has not been studied in HD. Based on theoretical considerations suggesting that brain regions known to be affected from HD are involved in economic decision-making, the present study sought to examine HD patients' performance in two neuroeconomic games.\nTwenty-nine manifest HD mutation carriers (20 males, nine females) performed an Ultimatum Game (UG) and a Dictator Game (DG) where third-party punishment of observed unfairness was required. In addition, patients were tested for neurocognition and the ability to understand other people's mental states (\"theory of mind\"). For comparison, a clinical control group of 30 patients with chronic schizophrenia, and 30 unaffected healthy controls matched for age and verbal intelligence took part in the study.\nPatients with HD had some appreciation of fairness rules, as they tended to reject unfair offers in the UG similar to controls. However, unlike the other two groups, individuals with HD did not punish observed unfairness from a third-party perspective. This lack of \"altruistic punishment\" was associated with deficits in executive functioning including working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility, and to a lesser degree with poor \"theory of mind.\"\nHD seems to be associated with impairments in understanding of more complex rules of social exchange. Aside from deficits in executive functioning, this behavior could, in part, be linked to an inability to experience third-party punishment as rewarding.", "The aim of this study was to validate the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue v. 1.5) in a Lebanese sample and compare its factorial structure to that of a UK sample. There were similar gender and age distributions in both samples as well as satisfactory structural reliabilities at the global, factor, and facet levels. Results from exploratory factor analysis showed a four-factor structure similar to that originally obtained by the author of the questionnaire. There were strong correlations between the factor scores derived from the two datasets (\u2265.90). Tucker congruence supported the similarity between the Lebanese and UK factors. Independent-samples t tests showed that Lebanese participants scored higher on the Sociability factor and the facets of self-esteem, social awareness and emotion perception, whereas UK participants scored higher on the facets of stress management, optimism and relationships. Gender differences are also reported, and recommendations for future research discussed.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are interwoven into our everyday lives and have grown enormously in some major fields in medicine including cardiology and radiology. While these specialties have quickly embraced AI and ML, orthopedic surgery has been slower to do so. Fortunately, there has been a recent surge in new research emphasizing the need for a systematic review. The primary objective of this systematic review will be to provide an update on the advances of AI and ML in the field of orthopedic surgery. The secondary objectives will be to evaluate the applications of AI and ML in providing a clinical diagnosis and predicting post-operative outcomes and complications in orthopedic surgery.\nA systematic search will be conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases for articles written in English, Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese language articles published up to September 2020. References will be screened and assessed for eligibility by at least two independent reviewers as per PRISMA guidelines. Studies must apply to orthopedic interventions and acute and chronic orthopedic musculoskeletal injuries to be considered eligible. Studies will be excluded if they are animal studies and do not relate to orthopedic interventions or if no clinical data were produced. Gold standard processes and practices to obtain a clinical diagnosis and predict post-operative outcomes shall be compared with and without the use of ML algorithms. Any case reports and other primary studies assessing the prediction rate of post-operative outcomes or the ability to identify a diagnosis in orthopedic surgery will be included. Systematic reviews or literature reviews will be examined to identify further studies for inclusion, and the results of meta-analyses will not be included in the analysis.\nOur findings will evaluate the advances of AI and ML in the field of orthopedic surgery. We expect to find a large quantity of uncontrolled studies and a smaller subset of articles describing actual applications and outcomes for clinical care. Cohort studies and large randomized control trial will likely be needed.\nThe protocol will be registered on PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews prior to commencement.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a significant role in Magnetic Resonance guided Radiotherapy (MRgRT), especially to speed up the online adaptive workflow. The aim of this study is to set up a Deep Learning (DL) approach able to generate synthetic computed tomography (sCT) images from low field MR images in pelvis and abdomen.\nA conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) was used for sCT generation: a total of 120 patients treated on pelvic and abdominal sites were enrolled and divided in training (80) and test sets (40). Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment plans were calculated on sCT and original CT and then compared in terms of gamma analysis and differences in Dose Volume Histogram (DVH). The two one-sided test for paired samples (TOST-P) was used to evaluate the equivalence among different DVH parameters calculated for target and organs at risks (OAR) on CT and sCT images.\nUsing a CPU architecture, the mean time required by the neural network to generate a synthetic CT was 175\u00a0\u00b1\u00a043 seconds (s) for pelvic cases and 110\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040\u00a0s for abdominal ones. Mean gamma passing rates for the three tolerance criteria analysed (1%/1\u00a0mm, 2%/2\u00a0mm and 3%/3\u00a0mm) were respectively 90.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5%, 98.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1% and 99.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2% for abdominal cases; 89.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.8%, 99.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7% and 99.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2% for pelvic ones, while equivalence within 1% was observed among the DVH indicators.\nThis study demonstrated that sCT generation using a DL approach is feasible for low field MR images in pelvis and abdomen, allowing a reliable calculation of IMRT plans in MRgRT.", "(Aim) COVID-19 is an infectious disease spreading to the world this year. In this study, we plan to develop an artificial intelligence based tool to diagnose on chest CT images. (Method) On one hand, we extract features from a self-created convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn individual image-level representations. The proposed CNN employed several new techniques such as rank-based average pooling and multiple-way data augmentation. On the other hand, relation-aware representations were learnt from graph convolutional network (GCN). Deep feature fusion (DFF) was developed in this work to fuse individual image-level features and relation-aware features from both GCN and CNN, respectively. The best model was named as FGCNet. (Results) The experiment first chose the best model from eight proposed network models, and then compared it with 15 state-of-the-art approaches. (Conclusion) The proposed FGCNet model is effective and gives better performance than all 15 state-of-the-art methods. Thus, our proposed FGCNet model can assist radiologists to rapidly detect COVID-19 from chest CT images.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a field poised to affect nearly every aspect of medicine, especially radiology. A PubMed search for the terms \"artificial intelligence radiology\" demonstrates an exponential increase in publications on this topic in recent years. Despite these impending changes, medical education designed for future radiologists have only recently begun. We present our institution's efforts to address this problem as a model for a successful introductory curriculum into artificial intelligence in radiology titled AI-RADS.\nThe course was based on a sequence of foundational algorithms in AI; these algorithms were presented as logical extensions of each other and were introduced as familiar examples (spam filters, movie recommendations, etc.). Since most trainees enter residency without computational backgrounds, secondary lessons, such as pixel mathematics, were integrated in this progression. Didactic sessions were reinforced with a concurrent journal club highlighting the algorithm discussed in the previous lecture. To circumvent often intimidating technical descriptions, study guides for these papers were produced. Questionnaires were administered before and after each lecture to assess confidence in the material. Surveys were also submitted at each journal club assessing learner preparedness and appropriateness of the article.\nThe course received a 9.8/10 rating from residents for overall satisfaction. With the exception of the final lecture, there were significant increases in learner confidence in reading journal articles on AI after each lecture. Residents demonstrated significant increases in perceived understanding of foundational concepts in artificial intelligence across all mastery questions for every lecture.\nThe success of our institution's pilot AI-RADS course demonstrates a workable model of including AI in resident education.", "Since January 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global concern, and its cardiovascular manifestations have highlighted the need for fast, sensitive and specific tools for early identification and risk stratification. Machine learning is a software solution with the ability to analyze large amounts of data and make predictions without prior programming. When faced with new problems with unique challenges as evident in the COVID-19 pandemic, machine learning can offer solutions that are not apparent on the surface by sifting quickly through massive quantities of data and making associations that may have been missed. Artificial intelligence is a broad term that encompasses different tools, including various types of machine learning and deep learning. Here, we review several cardiovascular applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence and their potential applications to cardiovascular diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in COVID-19 infection.", "Quantitative analysis has been applied extensively to image processing and interpretation in nuclear cardiology to improve disease diagnosis and risk stratification. This is Part 2 of a two-part continuing medical education article, which will review the potential clinical role for emerging quantitative analysis tools. The article will describe advanced methods for quantifying dyssynchrony, ventricular function and perfusion, and hybrid imaging analysis. This article discusses evolving methods to measure myocardial blood flow with positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography. Novel quantitative assessments of myocardial viability, microcalcification and in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and cardiac amyloidosis will also be described. Lastly, we will review the potential role for artificial intelligence to improve image analysis, disease diagnosis, and risk prediction. The potential clinical role for all these novel techniques will be highlighted as well as methods to optimize their implementation. (J Nucl Cardiol 2020).", "The complex span task used to evaluate working memory (WM) capacity has been considered to be the most predictive task of fluid intelligence. However, the structure of the complex span tasks varies from one study to another, and it has not been questioned yet whether these variants could influence the predictive power of these tasks. Previous studies have typically used either structures based on alternating processing-storage patterns or alternating storage-processing patterns. We present one experiment in which the participants were submitted to both the processing-storage vs. storage-processing types. After completing both types of complex span tasks, the participants performed a reasoning test (Matrix Reasoning of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - WAIS-IV). The results showed a significant difference in the WM spans between the two conditions, with higher spans observed in the processing-storage alternating structure, and different serial position curves. However, the correlations showed that both types of tasks remained equally predictive of performance in the reasoning test. These results are discussed in regard to the time-based resource-sharing model.", "Novel artificial intelligence techniques are emerging in all fields of healthcare, including gastroenterology. The aim of this review is to give an overview of artificial intelligence applications in the management of pancreatic diseases. We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed and Medline up to May 2020 to identify relevant articles. Our results showed that the development of machine-learning based applications is rapidly evolving in the management of pancreatic diseases, guiding precision medicine in clinical, endoscopic and radiologic settings. Before implementation into clinical practice, further research should focus on the external validation of novel techniques, clarifying the accuracy and robustness of these models.", "In this study, starting from our selective D3R agonist FOB02-04A (5), we investigated the chemical space around the linker portion of the molecule via insertion of a hydroxyl substituent and ring-expansion of the trans-cyclopropyl moiety into a trans-cyclohexyl scaffold. Moreover, to further elucidate the importance of the primary pharmacophore stereochemistry in the design of bitopic ligands, we investigated the chiral requirements of (+)-PD128907 ((+)-(4a R ,10b R )-2)) by synthesizing and resolving bitopic analogues in all the cis and trans combinations of its 9-methoxy-3,4,4a,10b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno[4,3-b][1,4] oxazine scaffold. Despite the lack of success in obtaining new analogues with improved biological profiles, in comparison to our current leads, a \"negative\" result due to a poor or simply not improved biological profile is fundamental toward better understanding chemical space and optimal stereochemistry for target recognition. Herein, we identified essential structural information to understand the differences between orthosteric and bitopic ligand-receptor binding interactions, discriminate D3R active and inactive states, and assist multitarget receptor recognition. Exploring stereochemical complexity and developing extended D3R SAR from this new library complements previously described SAR and inspires future structural and computational biology investigation. Moreover, the expansion of chemical space characterization for D3R agonism may be utilized in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug design, in the future.", "During a pandemic, healthcare professionals encounter various health hazards that affect their personal life and workplace. Emotional intelligence (EI) has a substantial impact on nurses' success and performance in the healthcare industry. However, previous research studies report inconsistent findings regarding how different levels of EI affect job performance (JP), particularly during pandemics. The present study contributes to the literature on this contemporary topic by investigating the impact of EI on JP among nurses during COVID-19 crisis management in Saudi Arabia (SA).\nIn a convenience sampling, 340 nurses from three tertiary hospitals completed an online survey assessing EI and JP during COVID-19 climax levels in March and April, 2020. Only nurses who had direct contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were eligible. The Wong & Law EI scale (WLEIS) was used in a cross-sectional design to determine participants' EI. Empirically, JP was measured by the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire (IWPQ). Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 20.0 (IBM Corp).\nGenerally, nurses reported, out of a 5-point Likert scale, moderate to high levels of EI (M = 3.99, SD = 0.434). Nurses in critical care units demonstrated the highest levels of EI, followed by nurses in intensive care, neonatal intensive care, then general nurses. Nurses working in respiratory therapy demonstrated the lowest levels. Across all groups during crisis, nurses reported a significant impact of EI on JP (\u03b2 = 0.389, p < 0.01).\nNurses reported satisfactory levels of EI, and most of their practices were aligned with national standards during COVID-19, but slightly in inverse to EI. However, more research is necessary to understand the greater impact of stressors influencing JP to the extent that levels of EI are no longer satisfactory.", "In this article, we propose a dataset about the energy consumption of mobile devices that was collected as part of a \"Tour de France\" with an electrical wheelchair. Part of these data was used to propose a mathematical model based on an experimental methodology of the energy consumed in mobile devices. Based on these precise measurements in a real environment, we have elaborated predictive models of energy consumption. The objective of this paper is to make accessible the data related to these publications to other researchers in several fields of science (computer science, telecommunications, meteorological science, artificial intelligence, statistics...). To our knowledge, this is the first publication of a dataset recording real world energy consumption data in mobile devices.", "Training algorithms to computationally plan multistep organic syntheses has been a challenge for more than 50 years1-7. However, the field has progressed greatly since the development of early programs such as LHASA1,7, for which reaction choices at each step were made by human operators. Multiple software platforms6,8-14 are now capable of completely autonomous planning. But these programs 'think' only one step at a time and have so far been limited to relatively simple targets, the syntheses of which could arguably be designed by human chemists within minutes, without the help of a computer. Furthermore, no algorithm has yet been able to design plausible routes to complex natural products, for which much more far-sighted, multistep planning is necessary15,16 and closely related literature precedents cannot be relied on. Here we demonstrate that such computational synthesis planning is possible, provided that the program's knowledge of organic chemistry and data-based artificial intelligence routines are augmented with causal relationships17,18, allowing it to 'strategize' over multiple synthetic steps. Using a Turing-like test administered to synthesis experts, we show that the routes designed by such a program are largely indistinguishable from those designed by humans. We also successfully validated three computer-designed syntheses of natural products in the laboratory. Taken together, these results indicate that expert-level automated synthetic planning is feasible, pending continued improvements to the reaction knowledge base and further code optimization.", "Whole slide imaging (WSI) has recently received FDA approval for sign out in surgical pathology and some anticipate this to mature into the gold standard. During this transition, it will be important to validate WSI for its intended use. And many studies have validated whole slide imaging by comparing diagnostic accuracy with that of conventual light microscopy (CLM); however, the assessment of histopathologic markers is prone to much more discrepancy. One of the best examples being tumor-bud scoring in colorectal carcinoma. Other signatures, including stromal differentiation or desmoplastic reaction; could better represent the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The findings in our study suggest stromal differentiation on both digital and glass slides to be much more reproducible (0.3585-0.9368) when compared to tumor budding (0.0968-0.7871). When comparing interobserver variation between glass and digital slides for three observers; stromal differentiation was more reliable on glass slides (0.4492), when compared to its digital counterpart (0.3016). On the other hand, interobserver variation for tumor bud scoring was more reliable on digital (0.1661), than glass slides (0.1026). Overall, there is significant variation between different observers and reproducibility issues present on conventual light microscopy transfer to digital slides. Although it is possible that too much emphasis is being placed on the concordance of WSI with CLM. In future, applications in artificial intelligence may be key to diagnostic precision and improved patient outcomes.", "Cognitive dysfunction is a significant complaint among patients after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), with devastating consequences on functional recovery and quality of life. Prognostic models allow a better assessment and management of neurotrauma patients. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the predictive value of the Baseline Prognostic Risk Score (BPRS) in moderate to severe TBI, in a sample of patients treated with neurotrophic factors. Eighty patients with moderate-severe TBI from the CAPTAIN II study were included in secondary data analysis. Patients received active treatment with Cerebrolysin, 50 mL per day for ten days, followed by two treatment cycles with 10 mL per day for ten days. BPRS was determined on admission; the age was recorded, and patients were evaluated using the following neurocognitive tests: Mini-Mental State Essay (MMSE), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition Processing Speed Index (WAIS-III PSI) and Stroop Colour Word Test-Victoria Version at 10, 30 and 90 days. Hierarchical regression analysis was performed to investigate the unique predictive value of BPRS on cognitive evolution, independent of age. BPRS independently predicted scores on the WAIS-III PSI DSCales and the Word subscale of the Stroop Colour Word Test at 90 days. Age was a significant predictor for all the investigated scales at 10, 30, and 90 days. This study demonstrates the predictive value of a validated prognostic model (BPRS) for medium-term neurocognitive outcomes in a sample of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury treated with neurotrophic factors.", "Sutures are a set of standard actions which are accomplished by multi-instruments, researchers studied the robot autonomy of suturing, which was based on movement planning completed by a single instrument, but did not consider the assignment of suturing tasks to instruments.\nA method was proposed for the autonomous suturing task assignment to instruments, which built a comprehensive evaluation index under some constraint conditions to determine the optimal scheme of the suturing task assignment to instruments.\nAn experiment of duodenal ulcer repair with a suturing operation was conducted under the guidance of a surgeon, and the results showed that the optimal scheme of the suturing task assignment was obtained by using the proposed method.\nThe proposed method can be used for autonomous suturing task assignment, which is beneficial for improving the intelligence of robot operation.", "Camouflaging involves masking and/or compensating for autistic characteristics and has been identified in autistic individuals through a variety of different methods. Individual variation in the extent, processes and outcomes of camouflaging has been reported in autistic adults, and there has been some investigation of camouflaging by autistic adolescents. This study was conducted to better understand how some of these individual differences emerge, by examining potential mechanisms (theory of mind, executive function, intelligence quotient and age) involved in camouflaging by 58 autistic adolescents aged 13-18\u2009years (29 females, 29 males). Fewer executive function difficulties predicted greater use of total camouflaging strategies and the compensation subscale, but not the masking or assimilation subscales; no other predictors reached statistical significance. These findings suggest that individual differences in executive function ability may underlie variation in the use of camouflaging by adolescents. The total variance explained in the model was small, suggesting the need to examine other factors which may underpin camouflaging. The implications of this finding for the relationship between camouflaging and well-being are discussed, along with the distinction between attempts to camouflage and the efficacy of those attempts. LAY SUMMARY: Camouflaging involves hiding your autism or finding ways around difficulties in order to fit in during social situations. This study found that autistic teenagers with good executive function abilities camouflage their autism more than those who struggle with executive function (which includes planning, goal-direction and memory). This may have implications for teenagers' mental health and their social functioning.", "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are the best alternative for immediate disclosure and diagnosis of skin diseases. Such systems comprise several image processing procedures, including segmentation, feature extraction and artificial intelligence (AI) based methods. This survey highlights different CAD methodologies for diagnosing Melanoma and related skin diseases. It has also discussed types, stages, treatments and various imaging techniques of skin cancer. Currently, researchers developed new techniques to detect each stage. Extensive studies on melanoma cancer detection were performed by incorporating advanced machine learning. Still, there is a high need for an accurate, faster, affordable, portable methodology for a CAD system. This will strengthen the work in related fields and address the future direction of a similar kind of research.", "To develop and evaluate a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) machine parameter optimization (MPO) approach based on deep-Q reinforcement learning (RL) capable of finding an optimal machine control policy using previous prostate cancer patient CT scans and contours, and applying the policy to new cases to rapidly produce deliverable VMAT plans in a simplified beam model.\nA convolutional deep-Q network was employed to control the dose rate and multileaf collimator of a C-arm linear accelerator model using the current dose distribution and machine parameter state as input. A Q-value was defined as the discounted cumulative cost based on dose objectives, and experience-replay RL was performed to determine a policy to minimize the Q-value. A two-dimensional network design was employed which optimized each opposing leaf pair independently while monitoring the corresponding dose plane blocked by those leaves. This RL approach was applied to CT and contours from 40 retrospective prostate cancer patients. The dataset was split into training (15 patients) and validation (5 patients) groups to optimize the network, and its performance was tested in an independent cohort of 20 patients by comparing RL-based dose distributions to conformal arcs and clinical intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) delivering a prescription dose of 78\u00a0Gy in 40 fractions.\nMean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD execution time of the RL VMAT optimization was 1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0s per slice. In the test cohort, mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD (P-value) planning target volume (PTV), bladder, and rectum dose were 80.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0\u00a0Gy (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), 44.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.6\u00a0Gy (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and 43.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.1\u00a0Gy (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for RL VMAT compared to 81.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0Gy, 51.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.9\u00a0Gy, and 36.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.3\u00a0Gy for clinical IMRT.\nRL was applied to VMAT MPO using clinical patient contours without independently optimized treatment plans for training and achieved comparable target and normal tissue dose to clinical plans despite the application of a relatively simple network design originally developed for video-game control. These results suggest that extending a RL approach to a full three-dimensional beam model could enable rapid artificial intelligence-based optimization of deliverable treatment plans, reducing the time required for radiotherapy planning without requiring previous plans for training.", "Novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) pandemic has neither clinically proven vaccine nor drugs; however, its patients are recovering with the aid of antibiotic medications, anti-viral drugs, and chloroquine as well as vitamin C supplementation. It is now evident that the world needs a speedy and quicker solution to contain and tackle the further spread of COVID-19 across the world with the aid of non-clinical approaches such as data mining approaches, augmented intelligence and other artificial intelligence techniques so as to mitigate the huge burden on the healthcare system while providing the best possible means for patients' diagnosis and prognosis of the 2019-nCoV pandemic effectively. In this study, data mining models were developed for the prediction of COVID-19 infected patients' recovery using epidemiological dataset of COVID-19 patients of South Korea. The decision tree, support vector machine, naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and K-nearest neighbor algorithms were applied directly on the dataset using python programming language to develop the models. The model predicted a minimum and maximum number of days for COVID-19 patients to recover from the virus, the age group of patients who are of high risk not to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, those who are likely to recover and those who might be likely to recover quickly from COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the present study have shown that the model developed with decision tree data mining algorithm is more efficient to predict the possibility of recovery of the infected patients from COVID-19 pandemic with the overall accuracy of 99.85% which stands to be the best model developed among the models developed with other algorithms including support vector machine, naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and K-nearest neighbor.", "Mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving tool and provides organ support for patients with respiratory failure. However, injurious ventilation due to inappropriate delivery of high tidal volume can initiate or potentiate lung injury. This could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ventilator associated conditions and finally increased mortality. In this study, we explore the viability and compare machine learning methods to generate personalized predictive alerts indicating violation of the safe tidal volume per ideal body weight (IBW) threshold that is accepted as the upper limit for lung protective ventilation (LPV), prior to application to patients. We process streams of patient respiratory data recorded per minute from ventilators in an intensive care unit and apply several state-of-the-art time series prediction methods to forecast the behavior of the tidal volume metric per patient, 1\u00a0hour ahead. Our results show that boosted regression delivers better predictive accuracy than other methods that we investigated and requires relatively short execution times. Long short-term memory neural networks can deliver similar levels of accuracy but only after much longer periods of data acquisition, further extended by several hours computing time to train the algorithm. Utilizing Artificial Intelligence, we have developed a personalized clinical decision support tool that can predict tidal volume behavior within 10% accuracy and compare alerts recorded from a real world system to highlight that our models would have predicted violations 1\u00a0hour ahead and can therefore conclude that the algorithms can provide clinical decision support.", "The 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' test (Eyes Test) has been widely used to measure theory of mind (ToM) or the ability to recognize the thoughts and feelings of others. Although previous studies have analysed its relationship with the ability to perceive emotions, the potential links with more complex emotional abilities remain unclear. The aim of the present research was to analyse the relationship between the Eyes Test and each of the emotional intelligence (EI) branches: perceiving, facilitating, understanding and managing emotions. In addition, we were interested in studying these relationships as a function of the Eyes Test difficulty. Eight hundred and seventy-four participants completed the Eyes Test and the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. A stepwise multiple regression analysis for the total score on the Eyes Test revealed that the best fitting model included the understanding, perceiving and managing emotion branches, with the understanding branch being the one most strongly associated with performance on the Eyes Test. Interestingly, stepwise multiple regression analysis for the easiest items of the Eyes Test revealed the same predictors, but, in the case of the most difficult items only the understanding branch was a predictor. These outcomes were not moderated by the influence of gender. Our findings support the notion that the Eyes Test can be used as a ToM task and that it is associated with complex EI abilities. Limitations and future lines of investigation are discussed.", "To explore the integration method and technical realization of artificial intelligence bone age assessment system with the hospital RIS-PACS network and workflow.\nTwo sets of artificial intelligence based on bone age assessment systems (CHBoneAI 1.0/2.0) were developed. The intelligent system was further integrated with RIS-PACS based on the http protocol in Python flask web framework.\nThe two sets of systems were successfully integrated into the local network and RIS-PACS in hospital. The deployment has been smoothly running for nearly 3 years. Within the current network setting, it takes less than 3 s to complete bone age assessment for a single patient.\nThe artificial intelligence based bone age assessment system has been deployed in clinical RIS-PACS platform and the \"running in parallel\", which is marking a success of Stage-I and paving the way to Stage-II where the intelligent systems can evolve to become more powerful in particular of the system self-evolution and the \"running alternatively\".", "As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied to biomedical research and clinical decisions, developing unbiased AI models that work equally well for all ethnic groups is of crucial importance to health disparity prevention and reduction. However, the biomedical data inequality between different ethnic groups is set to generate new health care disparities through data-driven, algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical decisions. Using an extensive set of machine learning experiments on cancer omics data, we find that current prevalent schemes of multiethnic machine learning are prone to generating significant model performance disparities between ethnic groups. We show that these performance disparities are caused by data inequality and data distribution discrepancies between ethnic groups. We also find that transfer learning can improve machine learning model performance for data-disadvantaged ethnic groups, and thus provides an effective approach to reduce health care disparities arising from data inequality among ethnic groups.", "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major neurodevelopmental disorder with heterogeneous symptoms, subtypes, and cognitive deficits. Cognitive deficits are central to ADHD pathophysiology and one potential source of heterogeneity in ADHD. Subtype-specific cognitive correlates are not, however, well-studied. We explored cognitive correlates of ADHD subtypes based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) scores. We also assessed subtype-specific self-esteem rating in ADHD subtypes and explored\u00a0its association with cognitive correlates.\nOne hundred thirty-nine children with ADHD (80.6% boy, 19.4% girl) were categorized into the predominantly \"hyperactive (ADHD-H)\", \"inattentive (ADHD-I)\" and \"combined (ADHD-C)\" subtype based on their symptoms and scores on the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL) and Conners Parent-Rating Scale (CPRS-RS). They were then individually administrated the WISC-IV and completed a self-esteem inventory. Group differences in the WISC-IV indices and their predictability in discriminating ADHD subtypes were analyzed.\nWe found a quantitative differentiation of cognitive abilities among ADHD subtypes with \"working memory\" as the most compromised cognitive domain. ADHD-I had the poorest cognitive profile while ADHD-H scored highest in all cognitive domains. Importantly, cognitive abilities were negatively correlated with inattention and positively correlated with hyperactive symptoms. Moreover, self-esteem ratings were positively correlated with the cognitive domains and were rated differently based on the subtypes. ADHD-H, with the highest cognitive strength, reported the highest level of self-esteem among all subtypes.\nADHD subtype-specific symptoms, cognitive deficits, and self-esteem problems should be considered for precise diagnosis and effective and personalized treatment in ADHD in light of further supporting evidence and assessments. Cognitive interventions might be more compatible with and effective in inattentive and combined subtypes of ADHD. Working memory improving-based interventions can benefit all ADHD subtypes. A supportive educational system in school and providing adjunct supportive interventions should be considered for children with ADHD\u00a0as well.", "While the world has experience with many different types of infectious diseases, the current crisis related to the spread of COVID-19 has challenged epidemiologists and public health experts alike, leading to a rapid search for, and development of, new and innovative solutions to combat its spread. The transmission of this virus has infected more than 18.92 million people as of August 6, 2020, with over half a million deaths across the globe; the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this a global pandemic. A multidisciplinary approach needs to be followed for diagnosis, treatment and tracking, especially between medical and computer sciences, so, a common ground is available to facilitate the research work at a faster pace. With this in mind, this survey paper aimed to explore and understand how and which different technological tools and techniques have been used within the context of COVID-19. The primary contribution of this paper is in its collation of the current state-of-the-art technological approaches applied to the context of COVID-19, and doing this in a holistic way, covering multiple disciplines and different perspectives. The analysis is widened by investigating Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for the diagnosis, anticipate infection and mortality rate by tracing contacts and targeted drug designing. Moreover, the impact of different kinds of medical data used in diagnosis, prognosis and pandemic analysis is also provided. This review paper covers both medical and technological perspectives to facilitate the virologists, AI researchers and policymakers while in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.", "Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is expected to significantly influence the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare in the near future. While there are only a handful of practical examples for its medical use with enough evidence, hype and attention around the topic are significant. There are so many papers, conference talks, misleading news headlines and study interpretations that a short and visual guide any medical professional can refer back to in their professional life might be useful. For this, it is critical that physicians understand the basics of the technology so they can see beyond the hype, evaluate A.I.-based studies and clinical validation; as well as acknowledge the limitations and opportunities of A.I. This paper aims to serve as a short, visual and digestible repository of information and details every physician might need to know in the age of A.I. We describe the simple definition of A.I., its levels, its methods, the differences between the methods with medical examples, the potential benefits, dangers, challenges of A.I., as well as attempt to provide a futuristic vision about using it in an everyday medical practice.", "The growth in information technology and computer capacity has opened up opportunities to deal with much and much larger data sets than even a decade ago. There has been a technological revolution of big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Perhaps many readers would immediately think about robotic surgery or self-driving cars, but there is much more to AI. This Short Communication starts with an overview of the key terms, including AI, machine learning, deep learning and Big Data. This Short Communication highlights so developments of AI in health that could benefit a low-income country like Nepal and stresses the need for Nepal's health and education systems to track such developments and apply them locally. Moreover, Nepal needs to start growing its own AI expertise to help develop national or South Asian solutions. This would require investing in local resources such as access to computer power/capacity as well as training young Nepali to work in AI.", "Early life adversity (ELA) in childhood is a major risk factor for borderline intellectual functioning (BIF). BIF affects both adaptive and intellectual abilities, commonly leading to school failure and to an increased risk to develop mental and social problems in the adulthood. This study aimed to investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of ELA associated with BIF in terms of global topological organization and structural connectivity and their relation with intellectual functioning. BIF (N=32) and age-matched typical development (TD, N=14) children were evaluated for intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioral competencies, and ELA. Children underwent an anatomical and diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) protocol. Global brain topological organization was assessed measuring segregation and integration indexes. Moreover, structural matrices, measuring normalized number of fibers (NFn), were compared between the 2 groups using network-based statistics. Finally, a linear regression model was used to explore the relationship between network parameters and clinical measures. Results showed increased behavioral difficulties and ELA, together with decreased network integration in BIF children. Moreover, significantly lower NFn was observed in the BIF group (p=.039) in a sub-network comprising anterior and posterior cingulate, the pericallosal sulcus, the orbital frontal areas, amygdala, basal ganglia, the accumbens nucleus, and the hippocampus. Linear regression showed that NFn significantly predicted IQ (p<.0001). This study demonstrated that ELA in children with BIF is associated with a decreased information integration at the global level, and with an altered structural connectivity within the limbic system strictly related to the intellectual functioning.", "This paper attempts to bring new ideas regarding the use of artificial intelligence in language learning apps. Artificial intelligence has seen a dramatic increase and its utilization in various aspects of data science, information science and various platforms is unprecedented. Its ubiquitousness is evident in smart cities, in online marketing, and data mining, however, its utilization in language learning apps is still somehow neglected. There are a few questions, such as why it is so, etc., this paper attempts to address. The research focuses on several most used language learning apps and the presence of artificial intelligence in them. The findings of the paper are as follows: basically none of the analysed apps uses any kind of machine learning, artificial intelligence or deep learning, and they are mostly based on predefined algorithms that do not utilize the full potential of the computational power we have currently available. The paper also suggests possible solutions and brings practical advice on how to implement artificial intelligence in these apps. The paper is important for any education innovation at the beginning of the 21 century. Without his innovative approach, education will lack sustainability and competitiveness, which will present a serious threat to the whole educational system.", "Colloquially known as coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a matter of grave concern for every country around the world. The rapid growth of the pandemic has wreaked havoc and prompted the need for immediate reactions to curb the effects. To manage the problems, many research in a variety of area of science have started studying the issue. Artificial Intelligence is among the area of science that has found great applications in tackling the problem in many aspects. Here, we perform an overview on the applications of AI in a variety of fields including diagnosis of the disease via different types of tests and symptoms, monitoring patients, identifying severity of a patient, processing covid-19 related imaging tests, epidemiology, pharmaceutical studies, etc. The aim of this paper is to perform a comprehensive survey on the applications of AI in battling against the difficulties the outbreak has caused. Thus we cover every way that AI approaches have been employed and to cover all the research until the writing of this paper. We try organize the works in a way that overall picture is comprehensible. Such a picture, although full of details, is very helpful in understand where AI sits in current pandemonium. We also tried to conclude the paper with ideas on how the problems can be tackled in a better way and provide some suggestions for future works.", "New in radiotherapy of solid tumors. The new irradiation techniques integrate the latest technological developments in medical imaging and computer science, dosimetry, and linacs into the treatment procedure. They raise new hopes for the treatment of solid tumor pathologies. Three techniques seem particularly promising: intensity modulated radiotherapy, respiratory gating radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiotherapy. The emergence of artificial intelligence, and particularly its applications in the field of imaging, opens up a new field of research. The purpose of these different innovations is to achieve very high precision radiotherapy, which makes it possible to better adapt the radiation fields to the tumor and thus protect the critical organs.\nNouveaut\u00e9s dans la radioth\u00e9rapie des tumeurs solides. Les nouvelles techniques d\u2019irradiation int\u00e8grent dans la proc\u00e9dure de traitement les derniers d\u00e9veloppements technologiques en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imagerie et d\u2019informatique m\u00e9dicales, de dosim\u00e9trie, et d\u2019appareils de traitement.

We had earlier reported that sex can be distinguished using known factors obtained from color fundus photography (CFP) in adult eyes. However, it is not clear when the sex difference in fundus parameters begins. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate sex determination based on fundus parameters using binominal logistic regression in elementary school students.\nThis prospective observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 119 right eyes of elementary school students (aged 8 or 9\u00a0years, 59 boys and 60 girls). Through CFP, the tessellation fundus index was calculated as R/(R + G + B) using the mean value of red-green-blue intensity in the eight locations around the optic disc. Optic disc ovality ratio, papillomacular angle, retinal artery trajectory, and retinal vessel were quantified based on our earlier reports. Regularized binomial logistic regression was applied to these variables to select the decisive factors. Furthermore, its discriminative performance was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Sex difference in the parameters was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test.\nThe optimal model yielded by the Ridge binomial logistic regression suggested that the ovality ratio of girls was significantly smaller, whereas their nasal green and blue intensities were significantly higher, than those of boys. Using this approach, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 63.2%.\nAlthough sex can be distinguished using CFP even in elementary school students, the discrimination accuracy was relatively low. Some sex difference in the ocular fundus may begin after the age of 10\u00a0years.", "Research on meditation and mindfulness practice has flourished in recent years. While much of this research has focused on well-being outcomes associated with mindfulness practice, less research has focused on how perception of self may change as a result of mindfulness practice, or whether these changes in self-perception may be mechanisms of mindfulness in action. This is somewhat surprising given that mindfulness derives from traditions often described as guiding people to realize and experience the non-separation of self from the world or its \"oneness\" with the whole of reality. The current study used a collective intelligence methodology, Interactive Management (IM), to explore the nature of oneness experiences. Five IM sessions were conducted with five separate groups of experienced meditators. Participants generated, clarified, and selected oneness self-perceptions they believed most characterized their experience both during meditation and in their everyday experience in the world. Each group also developed structural models describing how highly ranked aspects of oneness self-perceptions are interrelated in a system. Consistent themes and categories of oneness experience appeared across the five IM sessions, with changes in the sense of space (unboundedness), time, identity, wholeness, and flow highlighted as most influential. Results are discussed in light of emerging theory and research on oneness self-perception and non-dual awareness.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a significant growth in government surveillance techniques globally, primarily through the use of cell phone applications. However, although these applications can have actionable effects on public health efforts to control pandemics, the participatory or voluntary nature of these measures is obscuring the relationship between health information and traditional government surveillance techniques, potentially preventing effective oversight. Public health measures have traditionally been resistant to the integration of government-led intelligence techniques, such as signals intelligence (SIGINT), because of ethical and legal issues arising from the nature of surveillance techniques.We explore this rise of participatory SIGINT and its nature as an extension of biosurveillance through 3 drivers: the rise of surveillance capitalism, the exploitation of a public health crisis to obscure state of exception politics with a moral imperative, and the historically enduring nature of emergency-implemented surveillance measures.We conclude that although mobile applications may indeed be useful in containing pandemics, they should be subject to similar oversight and regulation as other government intelligence collection techniques.", "Today's Bachelor in Medicine, Bachelor in Surgery (MBBS) students will become Indian Medical Graduates in future. Emotional intelligence (EI) is an essential component in the making of an Indian Medical Graduate. There is increasing stress during medical training. The study was conducted to compare the association of EI score and perceived stress scale (PSS) among average and excellent undergraduate medical students. The secondary objective was to find the predictors of excellent academic performance.\nThis descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted after institutional ethics committee approval. All 522 consented students studying in 2nd, 4th, 7th, and 9th semesters filled up established pre-validated questionnaires ; Schutteself report EI test and Cohen's perceived stress scale. Sociodemographic details of the respondents were collected. Average attendance and marks of previous semester examinations of all included students were collected from academic cell of the institution. All students were grouped into three groups: average, good, and excellent performers from the marks collected. Comparison of EI scores and PSS scores was done between students in excellent and average groups using unpaired t-test.\nOf the 94.9% of respondents, 78.2% of the students were included in the study. The mean EI and PSS scores were 123 \u00b1 14.5 and 22.8 \u00b1 13.9, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in EI scores between average and excellent performers ([123.8 \u00b1 18.7] vs. [127.7 \u00b1 16]; P - 0.089). Perceived stress was lower in excellent performers ([20.9 \u00b1 11.1] vs. [24.8 \u00b1 15.0]; P - 0.01). EI was associated with better performance in clinical year students. EI was negatively correlated to perceived stress.\nOur study provides predictors of excellent academic performances among Indian medical undergraduates. This study suggests introduction of extracurricular activities in ongoing undergraduate curricular syllabus. It imparts awareness among students about the importance of attending classes. This study bestows higher EI and lower perceived stress to better academic performance.", "To assess the relationship between study abroad participation and levels of cultural intelligence (CQ) of dietetics students and professionals.\nParticipants were recruited via e-mail to complete an online survey, which included the Cultural Intelligence Scale and an additional 21 items developed and partially validated by the researchers. A mixed-method analysis was used to examine relationships between CQ levels, study abroad program participation, and international travel experiences.\nParticipation in study abroad programs and international travel experiences were related to higher levels of CQ in metacognitive (P\u202f=\u202f0.003; P < 0.001), cognitive (P\u202f=\u202f0.001; P\u202f=\u202f0.001), motivational (P < 0.001; P < 0.001), and behavioral (P\u202f=\u202f0.02; P < 0.001) dimensions.\nResults suggest that participation in study abroad programs and international travel experiences may result in high CQ levels and may equip students and practicing dietitians with skills, knowledge, and resources for practicing in culturally diverse communities. Future experimental research implementing study abroad programs and international travel opportunities for this population may help determine how these experiences impact dietetics practice in the long term.", "Recent advances in artificial intelligence show tremendous promise to improve the accuracy, reproducibility, and availability of medical diagnostics across a number of medical subspecialities. This is especially true in the field of digital pathology, which has recently witnessed a surge in publications describing state-of-the-art performance for machine learning models across a wide range of diagnostic applications. Nonetheless, despite this promise, there remain significant gaps in translating applications for any of these technologies into actual clinical practice. In this review, we will first give a brief overview of the recent progress in applying AI to digitized pathology images, focusing on how these tools might be applied in clinical workflows in the near term to improve the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists. Then we define and describe in detail the various factors that need to be addressed in order to successfully close the \"translation gap\" for AI applications in digital pathology.", "This study examined: (a) crystallized/fluid intelligence trajectories of adolescents and adults with Down syndrome; and (b) the contribution of endogenous (health, activities of daily living-ADL) and exogenous (cognitively stimulating leisure activities) factors on adults' intelligence with age.\nFour cohorts (N\u00a0=\u00a080) with Down syndrome participated: adolescents (ages 16-21) and adults (ages 30-45, 46-60 and 61+). All completed Vocabulary and Similarities (crystallized) and Block Design and Raven (fluid) intelligence tests (WAIS-IIIHEB , Wechsler, 2001).\nThe 30-45 cohort significantly outperformed the 16-21 cohort. Except for Vocabulary, which remained stable, onset of decline was at 40-50. Age-related declining health and ADL correlated with participants' lower fluid intelligence, but cognitive leisure activities mitigated this influence.\nIntelligence development into adulthood supported the continuous trajectory and compensation age theory, rather than accelerated or stable trajectories. Not only endogenous factors but also exogenous factors determined intelligence levels in adults with Down syndrome, supporting cognitive activity theory.", "Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field, combining linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence to enable machines to read and understand human language for meaningful purposes. Recent advancements in deep learning have begun to offer significant improvements in NLP task performance. These techniques have the potential to create new automated tools that could improve clinical workflows and unlock unstructured textual information contained in radiology and clinical reports for the development of radiology and clinical artificial intelligence applications. These applications will combine the appropriate application of classic linguistic and NLP preprocessing techniques, modern NLP techniques, and modern deep learning techniques.", "The article presents a solution supporting individualised learning in courses with a tight schedule. Such courses pose additional organisational challenges and require appropriate tools. The presented solution is based on an Intelligent Tutoring System immersed in repository of e-learning content, which enables selection of content immediately before its provision to the student instead of at the beginning of a course. Thanks to this, the system, having identified the student's needs, is able to make available the most suitable repository content at a given stage of education. The flexibility of the system is guaranteed by modularisation of content and its logical division using the UCTS taxonomy. The content has been described by means of concepts arranged according to the specificity of the domain to which the resources belong in order to ensure that the ITS is able to select relevant content. The proposed solution was used to set up an Applications of Fuzzy Logic course, which was part of an Artificial Intelligence class. The course was conducted within a very limited time frame resulting from the COVID-19 epidemic.", "Cardiovascular patients are at increased risk of acquiring coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection while their visit to healthcare facilities. There is a need for alternative tools for optimal monitoring and management of cardiovascular patients in the present pandemic situation. Digital health care may prove to be a new revolutionary tool to protect cardiovascular patients from coronavirus disease by avoiding routine visits to health care facilities that are already overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.\nTo evaluate the role of digital health care in the present era of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have reviewed the published literature on digital health services providing cardiovascular care.\nDigital health including telemedicine services, robotic telemedicine carts, use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, use of digital gadgets like smartwatches and web-based applications may be a safe alternative for the management of cardiovascular patients in the present pandemic situation.", "Most terminally ill cancer patients prefer to die at home, but a majority die in institutional settings. Research questions about this discrepancy have not been fully answered. This study applies artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to explore the complex network of factors and the cause-effect relationships affecting the place of death, with the ultimate aim of developing policies favouring home-based end-of-life care.\nA data mining algorithm and a causal probabilistic model for data analysis were developed with information derived from expert knowledge that was merged with data from 116 deceased cancer patients in southern Switzerland. This data set was obtained via a retrospective clinical chart review.\nDependencies of disease and treatment-related decisions demonstrate an influence on the place of death of 13%. Anticancer treatment in advanced disease prevents or delays communication about the end of life between oncologists, patients and families. Unknown preferences for the place of death represent a great barrier to a home death. A further barrier is the limited availability of family caregivers for terminal home care. The family's preference for the last place of care has a high impact on the place of death of 51%, while the influence of the patient's preference is low, at 14%. Approximately one-third of family systems can be empowered by health care professionals to provide home care through open end-of-life communication and good symptom management. Such intervention has an influence on the place of death of 17%. If families express a convincing preference for home care, the involvement of a specialist palliative home care service can increase the probability of home deaths by 24%.\nConcerning death at home, open communication about death and dying is essential. Furthermore, for the patient preference for home care to be respected, the family's decision for the last place of care seems to be key. The early initiation of family-centred palliative care and the provision of specialist palliative home care for patients who wish to die at home are suggested.", "In March 2020, a multidisciplinary task force (so-called Basque Modelling Task Force, BMTF) was created to assist the Basque health managers and Government during the COVID-19 responses. BMTF is a modelling team, working on different approaches, including stochastic processes, statistical methods and artificial intelligence. Here we describe the efforts and challenges to develop a flexible modeling framework able to describe the dynamics observed for the tested positive cases, including the modelling development steps. The results obtained by a new stochastic SHARUCD model framework are presented. Our models differentiate mild and asymptomatic from severe infections prone to be hospitalized and were able to predict the course of the epidemic, providing important projections on the national health system's necessities during the increased population demand on hospital admissions. Short and longer-term predictions were tested with good results adjusted to the available epidemiological data. We have shown that the partial lockdown measures were effective and enough to slow down disease transmission in the Basque Country. The growth rate [Formula: see text] was calculated from the model and from the data and the implications for the reproduction ratio r are shown. The analysis of the growth rates from the data led to improved model versions describing after the exponential phase also the new information obtained during the phase of response to the control measures. This framework is now being used to monitor disease transmission while the country lockdown was gradually lifted, with insights to specific programs for a general policy of \"social distancing\" and home quarantining.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated preference of children with autism spectrum disorder of near average to above average intelligence (high functioning autism - HFA) for remote learning. While many children with HFA excel at the academic curriculum, the majority struggle with the so-called hidden curriculum, which includes such things as social rules and societal norms. Explicit teaching of the hidden curriculum is often lacking in mainstream education classes and can be a tremendous stumbling block for children with HFA. The result is often anxiety and depression which can be exacerbated or sometimes even caused by the intense demands for sociability and flexibility required in most mainstream educational settings. Remote learning, while not a legitimate option until now, has provided these children with an opportunity to flourish at home and improve not only their grades but also their mental health. While remote learning or hybrid models may continue to be appropriate for some children, understanding of the hidden curriculum is necessary beyond the school years. Both mental health and academic proficiency will flourish to the degree we are able to make the hidden curriculum more explicit to children with HFA.", "Oxidative stress induced by excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) underlies several diseases. Therapeutic strategies to combat oxidative damage are, therefore, a subject of intense scientific investigation to prevent and treat such diseases, with the use of phytochemical antioxidants, especially polyphenols, being a major part. Polyphenols, however, exhibit structural diversity that determines different mechanisms of antioxidant action, such as hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and single-electron transfer (SET). They also suffer from inadequate in vivo bioavailability, with their antioxidant bioactivity governed by permeability, gut-wall and first-pass metabolism, and HAT-based ROS trapping. Unfortunately, no current antioxidant assay captures these multiple dimensions to be sufficiently \"biorelevant,\" because the assays tend to be unidimensional, whereas biorelevance requires integration of several inputs. Finding a method to reliably evaluate the antioxidant capacity of these phytochemicals, therefore, remains an unmet need. To address this deficiency, we propose using artificial intelligence (AI)-based machine learning (ML) to relate a polyphenol's antioxidant action as the output variable to molecular descriptors (factors governing in vivo antioxidant activity) as input variables, in the context of a biomarker selectively produced by lipid peroxidation (a consequence of oxidative stress), for example F2-isoprostanes. Support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and Bayesian probabilistic learning are some key algorithms that could be deployed. Such a model will represent a robust predictive tool in assessing biorelevant antioxidant capacity of polyphenols, and thus facilitate the identification or design of antioxidant molecules. The approach will also help to fulfill the principles of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement) in using animals in biomedical research.", "Depression is a widespread disease with a high economic burden and a complex pathophysiology disease that is still not wholly clarified, not to mention it usually is associated as a risk factor for absenteeism at work and suicide. Just 50% of patients with depression are diagnosed in primary care, and only 15% receive treatment. Stigmatization, the coexistence of somatic symptoms, and the need to remember signs in the past two weeks can contribute to explaining this situation. In this context, tools that can serve as diagnostic screening are of great value, as they can reduce the number of undiagnosed patients. Besides, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has enabled several fruitful applications in medicine, particularly in psychiatry. This study aims to evaluate the performance of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in the detection of depressive patients from the clinical, laboratory, and sociodemographic data obtained from the Brazilian National Network for Research on Cardiovascular Diseases from June 2016 to July 2018. The results obtained are promising. In one of them, Random Forests, the accuracy, sensibility, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were, respectively, 0.89, 0.90, and 0.87.", "Machine learning (ML) is entering many areas of society, including medicine. This transformation has the potential to drastically change medicine and medical practice. These aspects become particularly clear when considering the different stages of oncologic patient care and the involved interdisciplinary and intermodality interactions. In recent publications, computers-in collaboration with humans or alone-have been outperforming humans regarding tumor identification, tumor classification, estimating prognoses, and evaluation of treatments. In addition, ML algorithms, e.g., artificial neural networks (ANNs), which constitute the drivers behind many of the latest achievements in ML, can deliver this level of performance in a\u00a0reproducible, fast, and inexpensive manner. In the future, artificial intelligence applications will become an integral part of the medical profession and offer advantages for oncologic diagnostics and treatment.", "Acute ischemic stroke constitutes approximately 85% of strokes. Most strokes occur in community settings; thus, automatic algorithms techniques are attractive for managing these cases. This article reviews the use of deep learning convolutional neural networks in the management of ischemic stroke. Artificial intelligence-based algorithms may be used in patient triage to detect and sound the alarm based on early imaging, alert care teams, and assist in treatment selection. This article reviews algorithms for artificial intelligence techniques that may be used to detect and localize acute ischemic stroke. We describe artificial intelligence algorithms for these tasks and illustrate them with examples.", "Neuromorphic computing draws inspiration from the brain to provide computing technology and architecture with the potential to drive the next wave of computer engineering1-13. Such brain-inspired computing also provides a promising platform for the development of artificial general intelligence14,15. However, unlike conventional computing systems, which have a well established computer hierarchy built around the concept of Turing completeness and the von Neumann architecture16-18, there is currently no generalized system hierarchy or understanding of completeness for brain-inspired computing. This affects the compatibility between software and hardware, impairing the programming flexibility and development productivity of brain-inspired computing. Here we propose 'neuromorphic completeness', which relaxes the requirement for hardware completeness, and a corresponding system hierarchy, which consists of a Turing-complete software-abstraction model and a versatile abstract neuromorphic architecture. Using this hierarchy, various programs can be described as uniform representations and transformed into the equivalent executable on any neuromorphic complete hardware-that is, it ensures programming-language portability, hardware completeness and compilation feasibility. We implement toolchain software to support the execution of different types of program on various typical hardware platforms, demonstrating the advantage of our system hierarchy, including a new system-design dimension introduced by the neuromorphic completeness. We expect that our study will enable efficient and compatible progress in all aspects of brain-inspired computing systems, facilitating the development of various applications, including artificial general intelligence.", "To analyze corneal and epithelial remodeling differences between SmartSurfACE reverse transepithelial PRK (SCHWIND eye-tech-solutions) and Streamlight (Alcon Laboratories, Inc) transepithelial PRK procedure using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and artificial intelligence (AI).\nThis was a prospective, interventional, and longitudinal study. A contralateral eye study was conducted in which one eye was assigned to the SmartSurfACE group and the fellow eye was assigned to the Streamlight group. OCT was performed preoperatively and 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. Uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuity and residual refractive error was measured only preoperatively and at 3 and 6 months. From OCT, curvature and aberrations of the air-epithelium (A-E) interface, epithelium-Bowman's layer (E-B) interface, and epithelium Zernike indices (EZI) were derived. Pain was evaluated at 1 day postoperatively using the Wong-Baker scale.\nBoth groups had similar UDVA, CDVA, residual refractive error, and changes in A-E and E-B curvatures at 3 and 6 months postoperatively (P > .05). However, many parameters indicated that the Streamlight group underwent a greater change in A-E aberrations, E-B aberrations, and EZI than the SmartSurfACE group postoperatively (P < .05). The EZI indicated a greater level of epithelial thickness distortion in the Streamlight group than in the SmartSurfACE group (P < .05). Using AI, the EZI were most indicative of remodeling differences between the two groups. Further, the pain was significantly greater at 1 day in the Streamlight group (P < .05).\nEarly remodeling differences existed because the Streamlight procedure removed a greater amount of epithelium than the SmartSurfACE procedure. However, the visual and refractive outcomes were comparable.

This paper explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to evaluate interviews on loneliness, notably, employing natural language processing (NLP) to quantify sentiment and features that indicate loneliness in transcribed speech text of older adults.\nParticipants completed semi-structured qualitative interviews regarding the experience of loneliness and a quantitative self-report scale (University of California Los Angeles or UCLA Loneliness scale) to assess loneliness. Lonely and non-lonely participants (based on qualitative and quantitative assessments) were compared.\nIndependent living sector of a senior housing community in San Diego County.\nEighty English-speaking older adults with age range 66-94 (mean 83 years).\nInterviews were audiotaped and manually transcribed. Transcripts were examined using NLP approaches to quantify sentiment and expressed emotions.\nLonely individuals (by qualitative assessments) had longer responses with greater expression of sadness to direct questions about loneliness. Women were more likely to endorse feeling lonely during the qualitative interview. Men used more fearful and joyful words in their responses. Using linguistic features, machine learning models could predict qualitative loneliness with 94% precision (sensitivity\u202f=\u202f0.90, specificity\u202f=\u202f1.00) and quantitative loneliness with 76% precision (sensitivity\u202f=\u202f0.57, specificity\u202f=\u202f0.89).\nAI (e.g., NLP and machine learning approaches) can provide unique insights into how linguistic features of transcribed speech data may reflect loneliness. Eventually linguistic features could be used to assess loneliness of individuals, despite limitations of commercially developed natural language understanding programs.", "Does the human mind resemble the machines that can behave like it? Biologically inspired machine-learning systems approach \"human-level\" accuracy in an astounding variety of domains, and even predict human brain activity-raising the exciting possibility that such systems represent the world like we do. However, even seemingly intelligent machines fail in strange and \"unhumanlike\" ways, threatening their status as models of our minds. How can we know when human-machine behavioral differences reflect deep disparities in their underlying capacities, vs. when such failures are only superficial or peripheral? This article draws on a foundational insight from cognitive science-the distinction between performance and competence-to encourage \"species-fair\" comparisons between humans and machines. The performance/competence distinction urges us to consider whether the failure of a system to behave as ideally hypothesized, or the failure of one creature to behave like another, arises not because the system lacks the relevant knowledge or internal capacities (\"competence\"), but instead because of superficial constraints on demonstrating that knowledge (\"performance\"). I argue that this distinction has been neglected by research comparing human and machine behavior, and that it should be essential to any such comparison. Focusing on the domain of image classification, I identify three factors contributing to the species-fairness of human-machine comparisons, extracted from recent work that equates such constraints. Species-fair comparisons level the playing field between natural and artificial intelligence, so that we can separate more superficial differences from those that may be deep and enduring.", "This article reviews the history of artificial intelligence and introduces the reader to major events that prompted interest in the field, as well as pitfalls and challenges that have slowed its development. The purpose of this article is to provide a high-level historical perspective on the development of the field over the past decades, highlighting the potential of the field for transforming health care, but also the importance of setting realistic expectations for artificial intelligence applications to avoid repeating historical cyclical trends and a third \"artificial intelligence winter.\"", "Industry 4.0 considers the combinations of Internet of Things, computing and communication infrastructure, sensors, and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide predictive maintenance and process optimization. These benefits are very relevant to the semiconductor industry, where high reliability and low operating costs are critical for a business' success. Analyzing the state-of-the-art of the projects that present the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution in semiconductor companies, we noticed mainly two branches of initiatives: (i) articles that explain the final achievements, not detailing how they were assembled and structured; (ii) articles that detail a part of the industry ecosystem, for example, approaching only the communication system or AI algorithms. In this context, this article proposes an I4.0 Pilot as a compilation of lessons learned during an end-to-end development of a reference design applied to a semiconductor packaging and test company. We explore the requirements of clean rooms and information related to sensors and data acquisition boards, in addition to performance details and configurations pertaining to visualization tools and warning notifications. The main contribution appears in presenting the advantages of adopting flexible decisions in the pilot to enable the best characteristics for a final expandable solution. Our final idea is to emphasize the importance of having a pilot project without significant expenses, presenting the reader with the acquired knowledge, and how they can benefit from it.", "To determine the impact of hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) disorders on health outcomes in children and adolescents who received conformal radiation therapy (RT) for central nervous system tumors.\nCohort study including 355 patients (age \u226425 years at diagnosis) treated with high-dose (50.4-59.4 Gy) RT using photons for low-grade glioma or ependymoma. Patients (median age, 6.4 years at RT) received systematic endocrine follow-up (median duration, 10.1 years; range, 0.1-19.6). Associations between HP disorders and adverse health outcomes were determined by multivariable analysis.\nPrevalence was 37.2% for growth hormone deficiency (GHD), 17.7% for gonadotropin deficiency (LH/FSHD), 14.9% for thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency (TSHD), 10.3% for adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (ACTHD), and 12.6% for central precocious puberty (CPP). Hypothalamus mean dose \u2265 36\u00a0Gy was associated with higher odds of any deficiency. GHD was associated with short stature (OR 2.77; 95% CI 1.34-5.70), low bone mineral density (OR 3.47; 95% CI 1.16-10.40), and TSHD with dyslipidemia (OR 5.54; 95% CI 1.66-18.52). Patients with ACTHD and CPP had lower intelligence quotient scores, and memory scores were impaired in patients with GHD (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Treatment of GHD was not associated with increased risk for tumor recurrence, secondary tumors, or mortality.\nHP disorders occur frequently in patients receiving high-dose RT and are related to physical and neurocognitive well-being. Future studies are needed to assess whether further optimization of endocrine management yields better health outcomes.", "Dr Dean Warren was born in 1924 and died prematurely from cancer in 1989. He was a man of uncommon intelligence, wit, collegiality, integrity, honesty, and a true leader in American surgery. In 1966, he and his colleagues (Drs Zeppa and Fomon) presented a new concept for surgical shunts to control variceal hemorrhage while maintaining portal perfusion or hepatopetal blood flow. He termed this new shunt the distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS), which was the first selective shunt invented. The DSRS selective shunt was a brilliant improvement over the total shunt concept proposed by Nicolai Eck and was practiced worldwide during the 1980s. In a space of 2 decades, Dr Warren's pioneering work would show that the selective DSRS was superior to total shunts for treatment of portal hypertension, but that endoscopic sclerotherapy was a better first-line treatment for variceal hemorrhage than his own creation. His absolute adherence to the principles he espoused in his presidential address to the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract in 1973 were employed in his research and treatment of patients. This paper details Dr Warren's extraordinary research accomplishments and sets a lesson for us that well-designed clinical trials including randomization are essential in the advancement of the care of surgical patients.", "Acute lower respiratory infection is the leading cause of child death in developing countries. Current strategies to reduce this problem include early detection and appropriate treatment. Better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are still needed in poor countries. Artificial-intelligence chest X-ray scheme has the potential to become a screening tool for lower respiratory infection in child. Artificial-intelligence chest X-ray schemes for children are rare and limited to a single lung disease. We need a powerful system as a diagnostic tool for most common lung diseases in children. To address this, we present a computer-aided diagnostic scheme for the chest X-ray images of several common pulmonary diseases of children, including bronchiolitis/bronchitis, bronchopneumonia/interstitial pneumonitis, lobar pneumonia, and pneumothorax. The study consists of two main approaches: first, we trained a model based on YOLOv3 architecture for cropping the appropriate location of the lung field automatically. Second, we compared three different methods for multi-classification, included the one-versus-one scheme, the one-versus-all scheme and training a classifier model based on convolutional neural network. Our model demonstrated a good distinguishing ability for these common lung problems in children. Among the three methods, the one-versus-one scheme has the best performance. We could detect whether a chest X-ray image is abnormal with 92.47% accuracy and bronchiolitis/bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, lobar pneumonia, pneumothorax, or normal with 71.94%, 72.19%, 85.42%, 85.71%, and 80.00% accuracy, respectively. In conclusion, we provide a computer-aided diagnostic scheme by deep learning for common pulmonary diseases in children. This scheme is mostly useful as a screening for normal versus most of lower respiratory problems in children. It can also help review the chest X-ray images interpreted by clinicians and may remind possible negligence. This system can be a good diagnostic assistance under limited medical resources.", "The aim of this study was to examine the mediation of body mass index (BMI) on the association between per capita sugar consumption and diabetes prevalence using country-related data.\nIn this ecological study, based on 192 countries, data on per capita sugar consumption were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), on BMI from the World Health Organization and on diabetes prevalence from the International Diabetes Federation. Data on demography and economic factors were obtained from the Central Intelligence Agency, the United Nations and the FAO. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between per capita sugar consumption and diabetes prevalence, and mediation analysis to detect the mediated percentage of BMI on this association.\nEach increase of 100\u00a0kcal/day per capita sugar consumption was associated with a 1.62% higher diabetes prevalence [adjusted \u03b2-estimator (95% CI): 1.62 (0.71, 2.53)]. Mediation analysis using BMI as the mediator demonstrated an adjusted direct association of 0.55 (95% CI: -\u00a00.22, 1.32) and an adjusted indirect association of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.68). Accordingly, the BMI explained 66% (95% CI: 34%, 100%) of the association between per capita sugar consumption on diabetes prevalence.\nThese findings indicate that the association between dietary sugar intake and the occurrence of diabetes is mediated by BMI to a large proportion. However, it seems that other mechanisms may explain the association between sugar consumption and development of type 2 diabetes.", "Artificial intelligence is touted as the future of medicine. Classical algorithms for the detection of common bile duct stones (CBD) have had poor clinical uptake due to low accuracy. This study explores the challenges of developing and implementing a machine-learning model for the prediction of CBD stones in patients presenting with acute biliary disease (ABD).\nAll patients presenting acutely to Christchurch Hospital over a two-year period with ABD were retrospectively identified. Clinical data points including lab test results, demographics and ethnicity were recorded. Several statistical techniques were utilised to develop a machine-learning model. Issues with data collection, quality, interpretation and barriers to implementation were identified and highlighted.\nIssues with patient identification, coding accuracy, and implementation were encountered. In total, 1315 patients met inclusion criteria. Incorrect international classification of disease 10 (ICD-10) coding was noted in 36% (137/382) of patients recorded as having CBD stones. Patients with CBD stones were significantly older and had higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The no information rate was 81% (1070/1315 patients). The optimum model developed was the gradient boosted model with a PPV of 67%, NPV of 87%, sensitivity of 37% and a specificity of 96% for common bile duct stones.\nThis paper highlights the utility of machine learning in predicting CBD stones. Accuracy is limited by current data and issues do exist around both the ethics and practicality of implementation. Regardless, machine learning represents a promising new paradigm for surgical practice.", "Forms of artificial intelligence (AI), such as chatbots that provide automated online counselling, promise to revolutionise alcohol and other drug treatment. Although the replacement of human counsellors remains a speculative prospect, chatbots for 'narrow AI' tasks (e.g., assessment and referral) are increasingly being used to augment clinical practice. Little research has addressed the possibilities for care that chatbots may generate in the future, particularly in the context of alcohol and other drug counselling. To explore these issues, we draw on the concept of technological 'affordances' and identify the range of possibilities for care that emerging chatbot interventions may afford and foreclose depending on the contexts in which they are implemented. Our analysis is based on qualitative data from interviews with clients (n=20) and focus group discussions with counsellors (n=8) conducted as part of a larger study of an Australian online alcohol and other drug counselling service. Both clients and counsellors expressed a concern that chatbot interventions lacked a 'human' element, which they valued in empathic care encounters. Most clients reported that they would share less information with a chatbot than a human counsellor, and they viewed this as constraining care. However, clients and counsellors suggested that the use of narrow AI might afford possibilities for performing discrete tasks, such as screening, triage or referral. In the context of what we refer to as 'more-than-human' care, our findings reveal complex views about the types of affordances that chatbots may produce and foreclose in online care encounters. We conclude by discussing implications for the potential 'addiction futures' and care trajectories that AI technologies offer, focussing on how they might inform alcohol and other drug policy, and the design of digital healthcare.", "The goals of this study were to develop a risk prediction model in unmet dental care needs and to explore the intersection between social determinants of health and unmet dental care needs in the United States. Data from the 2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were used for this study. A chi-squared test was used to examine the difference in social determinants of health between those with and without unmet dental needs. Machine learning was used to determine top predictors of unmet dental care needs and to build a risk prediction model to identify those with unmet dental care needs. Age was the most important predictor of unmet dental care needs. Other important predictors included income, family size, educational level, unmet medical needs, and emergency room visit charges. The risk prediction model of unmet dental care needs attained an accuracy of 82.6%, sensitivity of 77.8%, specificity of 87.4%, precision of 82.9%, and area under the curve of 0.918. Social determinants of health have a strong relationship with unmet dental care needs. The application of deep learning in artificial intelligence represents a significant innovation in dentistry and enables a major advancement in our understanding of unmet dental care needs on an individual level that has never been done before. This study presents promising findings and the results are expected to be useful in risk assessment of unmet dental care needs and can guide targeted intervention in the general population of the United States.", "Many radiologists are considering investments in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the quality of care for our patients. This article outlines considerations for the purchasing process beginning with performance evaluation. Practices should decide whether there is a need to independently verify performance or accept vendor-provided data. Successful implementations will consider who will receive AI results, how results will be presented, and the impact on efficiency. The article provides education on infrastructure considerations including the benefits and drawbacks of best-of-breed and platform approaches in addition to highly specialized server requirements like graphical processing unit availability. Finally, the article presents financial and quality and safety considerations, some of which are unique to AI. Examples include whether additional revenue could be obtained, as in the case of mammography, and whether an AI model unintentionally leads to reinforcing healthcare disparities.", "Muscle ultrasound is a valuable addition to the neuromuscular toolkit in both the clinic and research settings, with proven value and reliability. However, it is currently not fulfilling its full potential in the diagnostic care of patients with neuromuscular disease. This review highlights the possibilities and pitfalls of muscle ultrasound as a diagnostic tool and biomarker, and discusses challenges to its widespread implementation. We expect that limitations in visual image interpretation, posed by user inexperience, could be overcome with simpler scoring systems and the help of deep-learning algorithms. In addition, more information should be collected on the relation between specific neuromuscular disorders, disease stages, and expected ultrasound abnormalities, as this will enhance specificity of the technique and enable the use of muscle ultrasound as a biomarker. Quantified muscle ultrasound gives the most sensitive results but is hampered by the need for device-specific reference values. Efforts in creating dedicated muscle ultrasound systems and artificial intelligence to help with image interpretation are expected to improve usability. Finally, the standard inclusion of muscle and nerve ultrasound in neuromuscular teaching curricula and guidelines will facilitate further implementation in practice. Our hope is that this review will help in unleashing muscle ultrasound's full potential.", "Deep learning (DL) algorithms are a subset of machine learning algorithms with the aim of modeling complex mapping between a set of elements and their classes. In parallel to the advance in revealing the molecular bases of diseases, a notable innovation has been undertaken to apply DL in data/libraries management, reaction optimizations, differentiating uncertainties, molecule constructions, creating metrics from qualitative results, and prediction of structures or interactions. From source identification to lead discovery and medicinal chemistry of the drug candidate, drug delivery, and modification, the challenges can be subjected to artificial intelligence algorithms to aid in the generation and interpretation of data. Discovery and design approach, both demand automation, large data management and data fusion by the advance in high-throughput mode. The application of DL can accelerate the exploration of drug mechanisms, finding novel indications for existing drugs (drug repositioning), drug development, and preclinical and clinical studies. The impact of DL in the workflow of drug discovery, design, and their complementary tools are highlighted in this review. Additionally, the type of DL algorithms used for this purpose, and their pros and cons along with the dominant directions of future research are presented.", "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by an exaggerated reaction of the body to an infection, that leads to organ failure or even death. Since sepsis can kill a patient even in just one hour, survival prediction is an urgent priority among the medical community: even if laboratory tests and hospital analyses can provide insightful information about the patient, in fact, they might not come in time to allow medical doctors to recognize an immediate death risk and treat it properly. In this context, machine learning can be useful to predict survival of patients within minutes, especially when applied to few medical features easily retrievable. In this study, we show that it is possible to achieve this goal by applying computational intelligence algorithms to three features of patients with sepsis, recorded at hospital admission: sex, age, and septic episode number. We applied several data mining methods to a cohort of 110,204 admissions of patients, and obtained high prediction scores both on this complete dataset (top precision-recall area under the curve PR AUC = 0.966) and on its subset related to the recent Sepsis-3 definition (top PR AUC = 0.860). Additionally, we tested our models on an external validation cohort of 137 patients, and achieved good results in this case too (top PR AUC = 0.863), confirming the generalizability of our approach. Our results can have a huge impact on clinical settings, allowing physicians to forecast the survival of patients by sex, age, and septic episode number alone.", "The accuracy level for reservoir evaporation prediction is an important issue for decision making in the water resources field. The traditional methods for evaporation prediction could encounter numerous obstacles owing to the effect of several parameters on the shape of the evaporation pattern. The current research presented modern model called the Coactive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (CANFIS). Modification for such model has been achieved for enhancing the evaporation prediction accuracy. Genetic algorithm was utilized to select the effective input combination. The efficiency of the proposed model has been compared with popular artificial intelligence models according to several statistical indicators. Two different case studies Aswan High Dam (AHD) and Timah Tasoh Dam (TTD) have been considered to explore the performance of the proposed models. It is concluded that the modified GA-CANFIS model is better than GA-ANFIS, GA-SVR, and GA-RBFNN for evaporation prediction for both case studies. GA-CANFIS attained minimum RMSE (15.22\u00a0mm\u00a0month-1 for AHD, 8.78\u00a0mm\u00a0month-1 for TTD), minimum MAE (12.48\u00a0mm\u00a0month-1 for AHD, 5.11\u00a0mm\u00a0month-1 for TTD), and maximum determination coefficient (0.98 for AHD, 0.95 for TTD).", "Data science has primarily focused on big data, but for many physics, chemistry, and engineering applications, data are often small, correlated and, thus, low dimensional, and sourced from both computations and experiments with various levels of noise. Typical statistics and machine learning methods do not work for these cases. Expert knowledge is essential, but a systematic framework for incorporating it into physics-based models under uncertainty is lacking. Here, we develop a mathematical and computational framework for probabilistic artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive modeling combining data, expert knowledge, multiscale models, and information theory through uncertainty quantification and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). We apply PGMs to chemistry specifically and develop predictive guarantees for PGMs generally. Our proposed framework, combining AI and uncertainty quantification, provides explainable results leading to correctable and, eventually, trustworthy models. The proposed framework is demonstrated on a microkinetic model of the oxygen reduction reaction.", "Our study aimed to explore the applicability of deep learning and machine learning techniques to distinguish MPE from BPE. We initially used a retrospective cohort with 726 PE patients to train and test the predictive performances of the driverless artificial intelligence (AI), and then stacked with a deep learning and five machine learning models, namely gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), extremely randomized trees (XRT), distributed random forest (DRF), and generalized linear models (GLM). Furthermore, a prospective cohort with 172 PE patients was applied to detect the external validity of the predictive models. The area under the curve (AUC) in the training, test and validation set were deep learning (0.995, 0.848, 0.917), GBM (0.981, 0.910, 0.951), XGBoost (0.933, 0.916, 0.935), XRT (0.927, 0.909, 0.963), DRF (0.906, 0.809, 0.969), and GLM (0.898, 0.866, 0.892), respectively. Although the Deep Learning model had the highest AUC in the training set (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.995), GBM demonstrated stable and high predictive efficiency in three data sets. The final AI model by stacked ensemble yielded optimal diagnostic performance with AUC of 0.991, 0.912 and 0.953 in the training, test and validation sets, respectively. Using the driverless AI framework based on the routinely collected clinical data could significantly improve diagnostic performance in distinguishing MPE from BPE.", "Amongst the 25.7 million survivors and 6.5 million deaths from stroke between 1990 and 2013, ischemic strokes accounted for approximately 70% and 50% of the cases, respectively. With patients still suffering from complications and stroke recurrence, more questions have been raised as to how we can better improve patient management.\nThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) were adopted to ensure a comprehensive inclusion of quality literature from various sources. PubMed and Embase were searched for evidence on thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, artificial intelligence (AI), antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation and hypertension management.\nThe directions of future research in these areas are dependent on the current level of validation. Endovascular therapy and applications of AI are relatively new compared to the other areas discussed in this review. As such, future studies need to focus on validating their efficacy. As for thrombolysis, antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy, their efficacy has been well-established and future research efforts should be directed toward adjusting its use according to patient-specific factors, starting with factors with the most clinical relevance and prevalence.", "With the development of the next generation of information technology, an increasing amount of attention is being paid to smart residential spaces, including smart cities, smart buildings, and smart homes. Building indoor safety intelligence is an important research topic. However, current indoor safety management methods cannot comprehensively analyse safety data, owing to a poor combination of safety management and building information. Additionally, the judgement of danger depends significantly on the experience of the safety management staff. In this study, digital twins (DTs) are introduced to building indoor safety management. A framework for an indoor safety management system based on DT is proposed which exploits the Internet of Things (IoT), building information modelling (BIM), the Internet, and support vector machines (SVMs) to improve the level of intelligence for building indoor safety management. A DT model (DTM) is developed using BIM integrated with operation information collected by IoT sensors. The trained SVM model is used to automatically obtain the types and levels of danger by processing the data in the DTM. The Internet is a medium for interactions between people and systems. A building in the bobsleigh and sled stadium for the Beijing Winter Olympics is considered as an example; the proposed system realises the functions of the scene display of the operation status, danger warning and positioning, danger classification and level assessment, and danger handling suggestions.", "Scientists all over the world are moving toward building database systems based on the One Health concept to prevent and manage outbreaks of zoonotic diseases. An appreciation of the process of discovery with incomplete information and a recognition of the role of observations gathered painstakingly by scientists in the field shows that simple databases will not be sufficient to build causal models of the complex relationships between human health and ecosystems. Rather, it is important also to build knowledge bases which complement databases using non-monotonic logic based artificial intelligence techniques, so that causal models can be improved as new, and sometimes contradictory, information is found from field studies.", "Apart from patients with severe neurological deficits, it is not clear whether surgical or conservative treatment of lumbar disc herniations is superior for the individual patient. We investigated whether deep learning techniques can predict the outcome of patients with lumbar disc herniation after 6\u00a0months of treatment.\nThe data of 60 patients were used to train and test a deep learning algorithm with the aim to achieve an accurate prediction of the ODI 6\u00a0months after surgery or the start of conservative therapy. We developed an algorithm that predicts the ODI of 6 randomly selected test patients in tenfold cross-validation.\nA 100% accurate prediction of an ODI range could be achieved by dividing the ODI scale into 12% sections. A maximum absolute difference of only 3.4% between individually predicted and actual ODI after 6\u00a0months of a given therapy was achieved with our most powerful model. The application of artificial intelligence as shown in this work also allowed to compare the actual patient values after 6\u00a0months with the prediction for the alternative therapy, showing deviations up to 18.8%.\nDeep learning in the supervised form applied here can identify patients at an early stage who would benefit from conservative therapy, and on the contrary avoid painful and unnecessary delays for patients who would profit from surgical therapy. In addition, this approach can be used in many other areas of medicine as an effective tool for decision-making when choosing between opposing treatment options, despite small patient groups.", "The evolution of remote systems and artificial intelligence technology has led to increase in robotic surgeries. One system used in this case report is the Senhance robotic system. The most important premise for using robotic surgery in cancer therapeutics is to ensure oncological safety. Similar to conventional laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery needs to be a reliable and secure surgical procedure, such as complete mesocolic excisions with central vascular ligations in Western countries or D3 lymph node dissections (dissection of the lymph nodes that locates from the origin to the terminal branch of the main feeding artery of cancer) in Japan.\nA 76-year-old man underwent clinical examination for severe anemia. He was diagnosed with transverse colon cancer of tumor (T)3, node (N)1a, metastasis (M)0 cancer stage IIIA. A right hemicolectomy with D3 lymph node dissection using the Senhance surgical system was performed. The operative time was 313\u00a0min and the estimated blood loss was 5\u00a0ml. He was discharged from our hospital 12\u00a0days after the surgery without any complications. What is the remarkable of this report, not only mobilization of right colon but also D3 lymph node dissection and vascular ligation were performed intraperitoneally by using Senhance robotic system as conventional laparoscopic surgery. We tried using fourth robotic arm to accomplish lymphadenectomies and middle colic artery dissection. A right hemicolectomy with D3 dissection using the Da Vinci surgical system was reported. Another report of a right hemicolectomy performed with the Senhance robotic system was identified; however, in that study, lymph node dissections were not performed intraperitoneally.\nTherefore, to our knowledge, this is the first report using the Senhance robotic system for right hemicolectomy with D3 dissection. We hope that our case report will assist in the establishment of this robotic procedure in surgical practice.", "Disasters and disease outbreaks have long been a catalyst for innovative applications of emerging technologies. The urgent need to respond to an emergency leads to resourceful uses of the technologies at hand. However, the best and most cost-effective use of new technologies is to prevent disease and improve resilience. In this paper, the authors present a range of approaches through which both opportunities can be grasped. Global connectedness enables more data to be collected and processed in emergencies, especially with the rise of open-source data, including social media. In general, the poorest and most remote populations are most vulnerable to disaster. However, with smaller, faster, smarter, cheaper and more connected technology, reliable, efficient, and targeted response and recovery can be provided. Initially, crowdsourcing was used to find people, map affected areas, and determine resource allocation. This led to the generation of an overwhelming amount of data, and the need to extract valuable information from that data in a timely manner. As technology evolved, organisations started outsourcing many tasks, first to other people, then to machines. Since the volume of data generated outpaces human capacity, data analysis is being automated using artificial intelligence and machine learning, which furthers our abilities in predictive analytics. As we move towards prevention rather than remediation, information collection and processing must become faster and more efficient while maintaining accuracy. Moreover, these new strategies and technologies can help us to move forwards, by integrating layers of human, veterinary, public, and environmental health data for a One Health approach.\nLes catastrophes et les foyers de maladies font depuis longtemps office de catalyseurs pour l\u2019\u00e9mergence d\u2019applications technologiques innovantes.

La acuciante necesidad de responder a una emergencia obliga a aguzar el ingenio con las tecnolog\u00edas que se tienen a mano. Con todo, el uso id\u00f3neo de las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas, y el m\u00e1s efectivo en relaci\u00f3n con el costo, pasa por prevenir las enfermedades y mejorar la resiliencia. Los autores presentan aqu\u00ed diversos m\u00e9todos que posibilitan ambas cosas. La interconexi\u00f3n planetaria hace posible que en el curso de las emergencias se re\u00fanan y traten cada vez m\u00e1s datos, sobre todo con el auge de los datos de c\u00f3digo abierto (incluidas las redes sociales). Por regla general, las poblaciones m\u00e1s pobres y aisladas son las m\u00e1s vulnerables a los desastres. Sin embargo, la existencia de tecnolog\u00eda cada vez m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a, r\u00e1pida, inteligente, barata e interconectada hace posible una labor fiable, eficiente y selectiva de respuesta y recuperaci\u00f3n. En un primer momento, los dispositivos de colaboraci\u00f3n abierta (crowdsourcing) fueron utilizados para encontrar a personas, cartografiar \u00e1reas afectadas y determinar la asignaci\u00f3n de recursos, todo lo cual generaba una ingente cantidad de datos y, a la vez, la necesidad de extraer de ellos informaci\u00f3n \u00fatil sin tardanza. A medida que la tecnolog\u00eda evolucionaba las organizaciones empezaron a externalizar muchas tareas, deleg\u00e1ndolas primero en terceras personas y despu\u00e9s en m\u00e1quinas.

Large-scale behavioral and neuroanatomical data from neurologic patients with focal brain lesions can be leveraged to advance our understanding of the key mechanisms of g, as this approach allows inference on the independence of cognitive processes along with elucidation of their respective neuroanatomical substrates. We analyzed behavioral and neuroanatomical data from 402 humans (212 males; 190 females) with chronic, focal brain lesions. Structural equation models (SEMs) demonstrated a psychometric isomorphism between g and working memory in our sample (which we refer to as g/Gwm), but not between g and other cognitive abilities. Multivariate lesion-behavior mapping analyses indicated that g and working memory localize most critically to a site of converging white matter tracts deep to the left temporo-parietal junction. Tractography analyses demonstrated that the regions in the lesion-behavior map of g/Gwm were primarily associated with the arcuate fasciculus. The anatomic findings were validated in an independent cohort of acute stroke patients (n = 101) using model-based predictions of cognitive deficits generated from the Iowa cohort lesion-behavior maps. The neuroanatomical localization of g/Gwm provided the strongest prediction of observed g in the new cohort (r = 0.42, p < 0.001), supporting the anatomic specificity of our findings. These results provide converging behavioral and anatomic evidence that working memory is a key mechanism contributing to domain-general cognition.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT General cognitive ability (g) is thought to play an important role in individual differences in adaptive behavior, yet its core processes remain unknown, in large part because of difficulties in making causal inferences from correlated data. Using data from patients with focal brain damage, we demonstrate that there is a strong psychometric correspondence between g and working memory - the ability to maintain and control mental information, and that the critical neuroanatomical substrates of g and working memory include the arcuate fasciculus. This work provides converging behavioral and neuroanatomical evidence that working memory is a key mechanism contributing to domain-general cognition.", "Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by a novel member of the coronavirus family, is a respiratory disease that rapidly reached pandemic proportions with high morbidity and mortality. In only a few months, it has had a dramatic impact on society and world economies. COVID-19 has presented numerous challenges to all aspects of health care, including reliable methods for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Initial efforts to contain the spread of the virus were hampered by the time required to develop reliable diagnostic methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of computer science with many applications for health care. Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses deep learning with neural network algorithms. It can recognize patterns and achieve complex computational tasks often far quicker and with increased precision than can humans.\nIn this article, we explore the potential for the simple and widely available chest X-ray (CXR) to be used with AI to diagnose COVID-19 reliably. Microsoft CustomVision is an automated image classification and object detection system that is a part of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. We utilized publicly available CXR images for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, pneumonia from other etiologies, and normal CXRs as a dataset to train Microsoft CustomVision.\nOur trained model overall demonstrated 92.9% sensitivity (recall) and positive predictive value (precision), with results for each label showing sensitivity and positive predictive value at 94.8% and 98.9% for COVID-19 pneumonia, 89% and 91.8% for non-COVID-19 pneumonia, 95% and 88.8% for normal lung. We then validated the program using CXRs of patients from our institution with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses along with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal CXRs. Our model performed with 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 97% accuracy, 91% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value.\nWe have used a readily available, commercial platform to demonstrate the potential of AI to assist in the successful diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR images. The findings have implications for screening and triage, initial diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and identifying patients at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Based on the data, a website was created to demonstrate how such technologies could be shared and distributed to others to combat entities such as COVID-19 moving forward.", "Gastric cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality across the globe, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 40%. In recent years, several applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged in the gastric cancer field based on its efficient computational power and learning capacities, such as image-based diagnosis and prognosis prediction. AI-assisted diagnosis includes pathology, endoscopy, and computerized tomography, while researchers in the prognosis circle focus on recurrence, metastasis, and survival prediction. In this review, a comprehensive literature search was performed on articles published up to April 2020 from the databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Thereby the current status of AI-applications was systematically summarized in gastric cancer. Moreover, future directions that target this field were also analyzed to overcome the risk of overfitting AI models and enhance their accuracy as well as the applicability in clinical practice.", "Crowdsourcing is a distributed problem-solving and production mechanism that leverages the collective intelligence of non-expert individuals and networked communities for specific goals. Social innovation (SI) initiatives aim to address health challenges in a sustainable manner, with a potential to strengthen health systems. They are developed by actors from different backgrounds and disciplines. This paper describes the application of crowdsourcing as a research method to explore SI initiatives in health.\nThe study explored crowdsourcing as a method to identify SI initiatives implemented in Africa, Asia and Latin America. While crowdsourcing has been used in high-income country settings, there is limited knowledge on its use, benefits and challenges in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. From 2014 to 2018, six crowdsourcing contests were conducted at global, regional and national levels.\nA total of 305 eligible projects were identified; of these 38 SI initiatives in health were identified. We describe the process used to perform a crowdsourcing contest for SI, the outcome of the contests, and the challenges and opportunities when using this mechanism in LMICs.\nWe demonstrate that crowdsourcing is a participatory method, that is able to identify bottom-up or grassroots SI initiatives developed by non-traditional actors.", "Objective: Clinical trials are the most effective way to judge the merits of diagnosis and treatment strategies. The in-depth mining of clinical trial data enables us to grasp the application trend of artificial intelligence (AI) for cancer diagnosis. The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of registered trials on AI for cancer diagnosis. Methods: Clinical trials on AI for cancer diagnosis registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov database were searched and downloaded. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 20.0 software. Results: A total of 97 registered trials were included. Of them, only 27 (27.8%) were interventional trials and 70 (72.1%) were observational trials. Fifteen (15.4%) trials had been completed. Fifty trials were in recruitment, and another 18 remained unrecruited. The number of cases included in the clinical trials tended to be large, 31 (32.0%) trials including samples ranging from 100 to 499 cases and 17 (17.5%) trials including samples ranging from 500 to 999 cases. Of the 27 interventional trials, only two trials reported trials' phase. Most (85.2%) interventional trials were for diagnosis, and a few (3.7%) were for the purpose of both the diagnosis and therapy of cancers. For the observational clinical trials, 46 (65.7%) were cohort studies, and 11 (15.7%) were case-only studies. Among the observational trials, 46 (65.7%) were prospective studies and 13 (18.6%) were retrospective studies. Among 97 trials, 37 (38.1%) involved colorectal cancer, 11 (11.3%) involved breast cancer, 43 (44.3%) were for imaging diagnosis, 33 (34.0%) were for endoscopic diagnosis, and 11 (11.3%) were for pathological diagnosis. For the interventional trials, 11 trials were parallel assignment (40.7%), and 14 were single group assignment (51.9%). Among the 27 interventional trials, 18 (66.7%) trials were performed without masking, 6 (22.2%) trials were performed with single masking, only 1 (3.7%) was performed with double masking, and 2 (7.4%) was performed with triple masking. Conclusion: It appears that most registered trials on AI for cancer diagnosis are observational design, and more trials are needed in this field.", "In-hospital cardiac arrest is a major burden in health care. Although several track-and-trigger systems are used to predict cardiac arrest, they often have unsatisfactory performances. We hypothesized that a deep-learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (DLA) could effectively predict cardiac arrest using electrocardiography (ECG). We developed and validated a DLA for predicting cardiac arrest using ECG.\nWe conducted a retrospective study that included 47,505 ECGs of 25,672 adult patients admitted to two hospitals, who underwent at least one ECG from October 2016 to September 2019. The endpoint was occurrence of cardiac arrest within 24\u2009h from ECG. Using subgroup analyses in patients who were initially classified as non-event, we confirmed the delayed occurrence of cardiac arrest and unexpected intensive care unit transfer over 14\u2009days.\nWe used 32,294 ECGs of 10,461 patients and 4483 ECGs of 4483 patients from a hospital were used as development and internal validation data, respectively. Additionally, 10,728 ECGs of 10,728 patients from another hospital were used as external validation data, which confirmed the robustness of the developed DLA. During internal and external validation, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the DLA in predicting cardiac arrest within 24\u2009h were 0.913 and 0.948, respectively. The high risk group of the DLA showed a significantly higher hazard for delayed cardiac arrest (5.74% vs. 0.33%, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and unexpected intensive care unit transfer (4.23% vs. 0.82%, P\u2009<\u20090.001). A sensitivity map of the DLA displayed the ECG regions used to predict cardiac arrest, with the DLA focused most on the QRS complex.\nOur DLA successfully predicted cardiac arrest using diverse formats of ECG. The results indicate that cardiac arrest could be screened and predicted not only with a conventional 12-lead ECG, but also with a single-lead ECG using a wearable device that employs our DLA.", "Looking back to the rumours from the early 2000's, when the world of technology bloomed together with the curiosity towards what was next to come, by 2020, robots should have assisted and supported almost every task from our daily life. While this may seem as a Sci-Fi movie scenario, it is partially a tangible reality, that we quickly got used to, thanks to the introduction of smart speakers. As the world changes, so does the future of our students. In this respects, the evolution of the technology comes up with specific environments for educational purpose. Building smart learning environments supported by e-learning platforms is an important area of research in education domain within our days. The evolution of these smart learning environments is justified by some events (Covid19) that force students to learn remotely. The paper proposes a software application component using Alexa smart speaker, that integrates different services (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Services) for a proper virtual environment platform, for both students and teachers. It addresses the main concerns of the current educational system, and provides a smart solution through the use of Artificial Intelligence based tools. The proposed approach not only achieves unifying data and knowledge-share mechanisms in a remotely mode, but it brings also a good learning experience, increasing the effectiveness and the efficiency of the learning process.", "Immunotherapy is a class of promising anticancer treatments that has recently gained attention due to surging numbers of FDA approvals and extensive preclinical studies demonstrating efficacy. Nevertheless, further clinical implementation has been limited by high variability in patient response to different immunotherapeutic agents. These treatments currently do not have reliable predictors of efficacy and may lead to side effects. The future development of additional immunotherapy options and the prediction of patient-specific response to treatment require advanced screening platforms associated with accurate and rapid data interpretation. Advanced engineering approaches ranging from sequencing and gene editing, to tumor organoids engineering, bioprinted tissues, and organs-on-a-chip systems facilitate the screening of cancer immunotherapies by recreating the intrinsic and extrinsic features of a tumor and its microenvironment. High-throughput platform development and progress in artificial intelligence can also improve the efficiency and accuracy of screening methods. Here, these engineering approaches in screening cancer immunotherapies are highlighted, and a discussion of the future perspectives and challenges associated with these emerging fields to further advance the clinical use of state-of-the-art cancer immunotherapies are provided.", "Parcourir l\u2019histoire de l\u2019intelligence artificielle, pour mieux la d\u00e9finir et la comprendre.\nL\u2019intelligence artificielle est une expression fourre-tout, qui suscite autant d\u2019espoirs que de craintes.

Trending topics, such as artificial intelligence approaches to guide thyroid incidentaloma workup, are also discussed.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently transforming all aspects of our daily life, including the practice of medicine. Artificial neural networks are a key method of AI. They can very effectively detect subtle patterns in imaging data and speech or text data. This is highly relevant for the practice of gastroenterology. Here, we summarize the state of the art in AI in gastroenterology and outline major clinical applications. Our focus is on AI-based analysis of endoscopy images, non-invasive imaging and histology images. In these applications, AI can support human pattern recognition. Beyond detection and classification of pathological findings, AI can predict clinical outcome from subtle image features.\nMASCHINELLES LERNEN UND K\u00fcNSTLICHE INTELLIGENZ: \u2002K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz (KI) ver\u00e4ndert derzeit alle Bereiche unseres Lebens- und Arbeitsalltags.

Herein, a simple and cost-effective approach is proposed to construct multifunctional textiles by electroless depositing a nickel-tungsten-phosphorus (Ni-W-P) ternary alloy on a polyamide (PA) fabric. The resultant fabric with a thickness of \u223c117 \u03bcm exhibits a favorable EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of 43.6 dB within 2-12.5 GHz. Particularly, finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation was introduced to investigate the effects of the PA fabric mesh number and Ni-W ratio on the EMI SE value, which was validated by experimental results. In addition, the conductive fabric demonstrates excellent heating efficiency (up to 140 \u00b0C under 2 V within 60 s), a wide operating range (from 40 to 140 \u00b0C), and simultaneously, satisfactory reproducibility by undergoing dozens of heating and cooling cycles. Notably, EMI SE of the multifunctional fabric remains unchanged even after a series of durability measurements including 180 \u00b0C heating, ultrasonication treatment, and repetitive peeling tests, respectively. Therefore, the prepared Ni-W-P coated PA fabric with prominent chemical stability and mechanical robustness endows enormous potential in multi-scene applications.", "Despite huge technological advances in the capabilities to capture, store, link and analyse data electronically, there has been some but limited impact on routine pharmacovigilance. We discuss emerging research in the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation across the pharmacovigilance lifecycle including pre-licensure. Reasons are provided on why adoption is challenging and we also provide a perspective on changes needed to accelerate adoption, and thereby improve patient safety. Last, we make clear that while technologies could be superimposed on existing pharmacovigilance processes for incremental improvements, these great societal advances in data and technology also provide us with a timely opportunity to reconsider everything we do in pharmacovigilance operations to maximise the benefit of these advances.", "As a form of artificial intelligence, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have the advantages of adaptability, parallel processing capabilities, and non-linear processing. They have been widely used in the early detection and diagnosis of tumors. In this article, we introduce the development, working principle, and characteristics of ANNs and review the research progress on the application of ANNs in the detection and diagnosis of gastrointestinal and liver tumors.", "The problem of common sense remains a major obstacle to progress in artificial intelligence. Here, we argue that common sense in humans is founded on a set of basic capacities that are possessed by many other animals, capacities pertaining to the understanding of objects, space, and causality. The field of animal cognition has developed numerous experimental protocols for studying these capacities and, thanks to progress in deep reinforcement learning (RL), it is now possible to apply these methods directly to evaluate RL agents in 3D environments. Besides evaluation, the animal cognition literature offers a rich source of behavioural data, which can serve as inspiration for RL tasks and curricula.", "AML diagnostics, initially based solely on morphological evaluation, now relies on multiple disciplines to reach its full potential. Only by integrating the results of cytomorphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics and molecular genetics it is possible to fulfil WHO classification and ELN prognostication systems. Especially molecular genetics has gained a lot of interest over the last decade, mainly through the introduction of next generation sequencing (NGS). NGS application ranges from the investigation of single genes and panels to even whole exomes, transcriptomes and genomes. In routine AML diagnostics panels are the preferred NGS methodology. Here, we will review the power and limitations of NGS in the context of diagnosis, prognosis and precision medicine. Due to high dimensionality, NGS data interpretation is challenging but it also offers a unique investigatory chance and the opportunity to apply data mining techniques such as artificial intelligence. We will also reflect on how the incorporation of the improved knowledge base into routine diagnostics can pave the way for better treatment and more cure in AML.", "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) hold promise to augment neuroimaging diagnosis for patients with brain tumors and stroke. Here, the authors review the diverse landscape of emerging neuroimaging applications of AI, including workflow optimization, lesion segmentation, and precision education. Given the many modalities used in diagnosing neurologic diseases, AI may be deployed to integrate across modalities (MR imaging, computed tomography, PET, electroencephalography, clinical and laboratory findings), facilitate crosstalk among specialists, and potentially improve diagnosis in patients with trauma, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and neurodegeneration. Together, there are myriad applications of AI for neuroradiology.\"", "Artificial intelligence, and more narrowly machine-learning, is beginning to expand humanity's capacity to analyze increasingly large and complex datasets. Advances in computer hardware and software have led to breakthroughs in multiple sectors of our society, including a burgeoning role in medical research and clinical practice. As the volume of medical data grows at an apparently exponential rate, particularly since the human genome project laid the foundation for modern genetic inquiry, informatics tools like machine learning are becoming crucial in analyzing these data to provide meaningful tools for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. Within medicine, hematologic diseases can be particularly challenging to understand and treat given the increasingly complex and intercalated genetic, epigenetic, immunologic, and regulatory pathways that must be understood to optimize patient outcomes. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), new developments in machine learning algorithms have enabled a deeper understanding of disease biology and the development of better prognostic and predictive tools. Ongoing work in the field brings these developments incrementally closer to clinical implementation.", "Globally, preterm birth has replaced congenital malformation as the major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. The reduced rate of congenital malformation was not achieved through a single biophysical or biochemical marker at a specific gestational age, but rather through a combination of clinical, biophysical and biochemical markers at different gestational ages. Since the aetiology of spontaneous preterm birth is also multifactorial, it is unlikely that a single biomarker test, at a specific gestational age will emerge as the definitive predictive test.\nThe Biomarkers Group of PREBIC, comprising clinicians, basic scientists and other experts in the field, with a particular interest in preterm birth have produced this commentary with short, medium and long-term aims: i) to alert clinicians to the advances that are being made in the prediction of spontaneous preterm birth; ii) to encourage clinicians and scientists to continue their efforts in this field, and not to be disheartened or nihilistic because of a perceived lack of progress and iii) to enable development of novel interventions that can reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with preterm birth.\nUsing language that we hope is clear to practising clinicians, we have identified 11 Sections in which there exists the potential, feasibility and capability of technologies for candidate biomarkers in the prediction of spontaneous preterm birth and how current limitations to this research might be circumvented.\nThe combination of biophysical, biochemical, immunological, microbiological, fetal cell, exosomal, or cell free RNA at different gestational ages, integrated as part of a multivariable predictor model may be necessary to advance our attempts to predict sPTL and PTB. This will require systems biological data using \"omics\" data and artificial intelligence/machine learning to manage the data appropriately. The ultimate goal is to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with preterm birth.", "This study aimed to profile the cytokine/chemokine response from day 0 to 7 in infants (\u226536 weeks of gestational age) with neonatal encephalopathy (NE) and to explore the association with long-term outcomes.\nThis was a secondary study of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network randomized controlled trial of whole body hypothermia for NE. Eligible infants with moderate-severe NE were randomized to cooling or normothermia. Blood spots were collected on days 0 to 1, 2 to 4, and 6 to 7. Twenty-four cytokines/chemokines were measured using a multiplex platform. Surviving infants underwent neurodevelopmental assessment at 6 to 7 years. Primary outcome was death or moderate-severe impairment defined by any of the following: intelligence quotient <70, moderate-severe cerebral palsy (CP), blindness, hearing impairment, or epilepsy.\nCytokine blood spots were collected from 109 participants. In total 99 of 109 (91%) were assessed at 6 to 7 years; 54 of 99 (55%) developed death/impairment. Neonates who died or were impaired had lower early regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) and higher day 7 monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 levels than neonates who survived without impairment. Though TNF-\u03b1 levels had no association with death/impairment, higher day 0 to 1 levels were observed among neonates who died/developed CP. On multiple regression analysis adjusted for center, treatment group, sex, race, and level of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, higher RANTES was inversely associated with death/impairment (odds ratio (OR): 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.74), while day seven MCP-1 level was directly associated with death/impairment (OR: 3.70, 95% CI: 1.42-9.61). Targeted cytokine/chemokine levels demonstrated little variation with hypothermia treatment.\nRANTES and MCP-1 levels in the first week of life may provide potential targets for future therapies among neonates with encephalopathy.\n\u00b7 Elevation of specific cytokines and chemokines in neonates with encephalopathy has been noted along with increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment in infancy.. \u00b7 Cytokine/chemokines at <7 days were assessed among neonates in a trial of hypothermia for HIE.. \u00b7 Neonates who died or were impaired at 6 to 7 years following hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy had lower RANTES and higher MCP-1 levels than those who survived without impairment..", "Hemorrhagic stroke is a medical emergency. Artificial intelligence techniques and algorithms may be used to automatically detect and quantitate intracranial hemorrhage in a semiautomated fashion. This article reviews the use of deep learning convolutional neural networks for managing hemorrhagic stroke. Such a capability may be used to alert appropriate care teams, make decisions about patient transport from a primary care center to a comprehensive stroke center, and assist in treatment selection. This article reviews artificial intelligence algorithms for intracranial hemorrhage detection, quantification, and prognostication. Multiple algorithms currently being explored are described and illustrated with the help of examples.", "Urine is the most common material tested in clinical microbiology laboratories. Automated analysis is already performed, permitting quicker results and decreasing the laboratory technologist's (LT) workload. These automatic systems have introduced digital imaging concepts. PhenoMATRIX (PHM) is an artificial intelligence software that merges picture algorithms and user rules to provide presumptive results. This study aimed at designing a tailored workflow using PHM, performing its validation and checking its performance in routine practice.\nTwo data collections including 96 and 135 urine samples from nephrostomy/ureterostomy and artificial bladder (US), 948 and 1257 urine samples from catheter (UC) and 3251 and 2027 midstream urine (MSU) were used to compare LT results with those obtained using two versions of PHM. Another 19 US, 102 UC and 508 MSU were used to monitor performance level 3\u00a0months after routine implementation.\nBefore and after revisions, agreement between the first version of PHM and LT results were 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74.3-90.2) and 83% (95% CI, 75.3-90.9) (US), 66.7% (95% CI, 63.5-69.5) and 71.7% (95% CI, 68.8-74.4) (UC) and 65.4% (95% CI, 63.8-67.1) and 76% (95% CI, 74.1-77.1) (MSU). The second version improved results, demonstrating 96.2% (95% CI, 91.6-98.8) and 97% (95% CI, 92.6-99.2) (US), 87.5% (95% CI, 85.5-89.2) and 88.9% (95% CI, 87.0-90.5) (UC) and 91% (95% CI, 89.7-92.1) and 92% (95% CI, 91.1-93.4) (MSU) of agreement with LT results before and after revisions. The reliability of PHM results was confirmed by a routine study demonstrating 92% (95% CI, 90.0-94.2) overall agreement.\nPHM showed high performance, with >90% of results in agreement with LT. PHM could help standardize and secure results, prioritize positive plates during analytical workflow and likely save LT time.", "Readmission and death in cirrhosis are common, expensive, and difficult to predict. Our aim was to evaluate the abilities of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict clinical outcomes based on variables collected at admission, during hospitalization, and at discharge.\nWe used the multicenter North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD) cohort of cirrhotic inpatients who are followed up through 90-days postdischarge for readmission and death. We used statistical methods to select variables that are significant for readmission and death and trained 3 AI models, including logistic regression (LR), kernel support vector machine (SVM), and random forest classifiers (RFC), to predict readmission and death. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from 10-fold crossvalidation for evaluation to compare sexes. Data were compared with model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) at discharge.\nWe included 2,170 patients (57 \u00b1 11 years, MELD 18 \u00b1 7, 61% men, 79% White, and 8% Hispanic). The 30-day and 90-day readmission rates were 28% and 47%, respectively, and 13% died at 90 days. Prediction for 30-day readmission resulted in 0.60 AUC for all patients with RFC, 0.57 AUC with LR for women-only subpopulation, and 0.61 AUC with LR for men-only subpopulation. For 90-day readmission, the highest AUC was achieved with kernel SVM and RFC (AUC = 0.62). We observed higher predictive value when training models with only women (AUC = 0.68 LR) vs men (AUC = 0.62 kernel SVM). Prediction for death resulted in 0.67 AUC for all patients, 0.72 for women-only subpopulation, and 0.69 for men-only subpopulation, all with LR. MELD-Na model AUC was similar to those from the AI models.\nDespite using multiple AI techniques, it is difficult to predict 30- and 90-day readmissions and death in cirrhosis. AI model accuracies were equivalent to models generated using only MELD-Na scores. Additional biomarkers are needed to improve our predictive capability (See also the visual abstract at http://links.lww.com/AJG/B710).", "Artificial intelligence has been increasingly employed to improve operations for various firms and industries. In this study, we construct a box office revenue prediction system for a film at its early stage of production, which can help management overcome resource allocation challenges considering the significant investment and risk for the whole film production. In this research, we focus on China's film market, the second-largest box office in the world. Our model is based on data regarding the nature of a film itself without word-of-mouth data from social platforms. Combining extreme gradient boosting, random forest, light gradient boosting machine, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and stacking model fusion theory, we establish a stacking model for film box office prediction. Our empirical results show that the model exhibits good prediction accuracy, with its 1-Away accuracy being 86.46%. Moreover, our results show that star influence has the strongest predictive power in this model.", "To assess diagnostic accuracy of 36-week anthropometric weight, length, and head circumference <10th and <3rd percentiles to predict preterm infant cognitive impairment.\nCohort study of 898 preterm <30-week very-low-birth weight (<1500\u2009g) infants. Anthropometric measures' accuracy to predict cognitive impairment (Bayley-III Cognitive Composite score) <80, 21-months corrected age (CA) and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Quotient (intellectual outcomes) <70, 36-months CA, were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.\nThirty-six-week weight, length or head circumference <10th or <3rd percentile did not predict cognitive impairment; areas under ROC curves were <0.6. Sensitivities and specificities for 10th and 3rd percentile cut points were all poor, with most not exceeding 70%, whether the Fenton 2013 or INTERGROWTH 2015 growth charts were used. Brain injury and low maternal education were better predictors of cognitive impairment.\nPreterm infant 36-week anthropometric measurements are not accurate predictors of cognitive impairment.", "Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been approved as a pan-cancer biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, current MSI identification methods are not available for all patients. We proposed an ensemble multiple instance deep learning model to predict microsatellite status based on histopathology images, and interpreted the pathomics-based model with multi-omics correlation. Methods: Two cohorts of patients were collected, including 429 from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-COAD) and 785 from an Asian colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort (Asian-CRC). We established the pathomics model, named Ensembled Patch Likelihood Aggregation (EPLA), based on two consecutive stages: patch-level prediction and WSI-level prediction. The initial model was developed and validated in TCGA-COAD, and then generalized in Asian-CRC through transfer learning. The pathological signatures extracted from the model were analyzed with genomic and transcriptomic profiles for model interpretation. Results: The EPLA model achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.8848 (95% CI: 0.8185-0.9512) in the TCGA-COAD test set and an AUC of 0.8504 (95% CI: 0.7591-0.9323) in the external validation set Asian-CRC after transfer learning. Notably, EPLA captured the relationship between pathological phenotype of poor differentiation and MSI (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the five pathological imaging signatures identified from the EPLA model were associated with mutation burden and DNA damage repair related genotype in the genomic profiles, and antitumor immunity activated pathway in the transcriptomic profiles. Conclusions: Our pathomics-based deep learning model can effectively predict MSI from histopathology images and is transferable to a new patient cohort. The interpretability of our model by association with pathological, genomic and transcriptomic phenotypes lays the foundation for prospective clinical trials of the application of this artificial intelligence (AI) platform in ICB therapy.", "Sepsis mortality is still unacceptably high and an appropriate prognostic tool may increase the accuracy for clinical decisions.\nTo evaluate several supervised techniques of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for classification and prediction of mortality, in adult patients hospitalized by emergency services with sepsis diagnosis.\nSecondary data analysis of a prospective cohort in three university hospitals in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. We included patients >18\u202fyears hospitalized for suspected or confirmed infection and any organ dysfunction according to the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment. The outcome variable was hospital mortality and the prediction variables were grouped into those related to the initial clinical treatment and care or to the direct measurement of physiological disturbances. Four supervised classification techniques were analyzed: the C4.5 Decision Tree, Random Forest, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) models. Their performance was evaluated by the concordance between the observed and predicted outcomes and by the discrimination according to AUC-ROC.\nA total of 2510 patients with a median age of 62\u202fyears (IQR\u202f=\u202f46-74) and an overall hospital mortality rate of 11.5% (n\u202f=\u202f289). The best discrimination was provided by the SVM and ANN using physiological variables, with an AUC-ROC of 0.69 (95%CI: 0.62; 0.76) and AUC-ROC of 0.69 (95%CI: 0.61; 0.76) respectively.\nDeep learning and AI are increasingly used as support tools in clinical medicine. Their performance in a syndrome as complex and heterogeneous as sepsis may be a new horizon in clinical research. SVM and ANN seem promising for improving sepsis classification and prognosis.", "Radiology topics receive substantial online media attention, with prior studies focusing on social media platform coverage. We used Google Alerts, a content change detection and notification service, to prospectively analyze new radiology-related content appearing on the internet.\nAn automated notification was created on Google Alerts for the search term \"radiology,\" sending the user emails with up to 3 new links daily. All links from November 2019 through April 2020 were assessed by 2 of 3 independent raters using a coding system to classify the content source and primary topic of discussion. The top 5 primary topics were retrospectively evaluated to identify prevalent subcategories. Content viewing restrictions were documented.\n526 links were accessed. The majority (68%) of links were created by non-radiology lay press, followed by radiology-related lay press (28%), university-based publications (2%), and professional society websites (2%). The primary topic of these links most frequently related to market trends (28%), promotional material (20%), COVID-19 (13%), artificial intelligence (8%), and new technology or equipment (5%). 15% of links discussed a topic sourced from another article, such as a peer-reviewed journal, though only 2 linked directly to the journal itself. 8% of links had content viewing restrictions.\nNew radiology content was largely disseminated via non-radiology news sources; radiologists should therefore ensure their research and viewpoints are presented in these outlets. Google Alerts may be a useful tool to stay abreast of the most current public radiology subject matters, especially during these times of social isolation and rapidly evolving clinical practice.", "Early detection of COVID-19 based on chest CT enables timely treatment of patients and helps control the spread of the disease. We proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) system for rapid COVID-19 detection and performed extensive statistical analysis of CTs of COVID-19 based on the AI system. We developed and evaluated our system on a large dataset with more than 10 thousand CT volumes from COVID-19, influenza-A/B, non-viral community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and non-pneumonia subjects. In such a difficult multi-class diagnosis task, our deep convolutional neural network-based system is able to achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 97.81% for multi-way classification on test cohort of 3,199 scans, AUC of 92.99% and 93.25% on two publicly available datasets, CC-CCII and MosMedData respectively. In a reader study involving five radiologists, the AI system outperforms all of radiologists in more challenging tasks at a speed of two orders of magnitude above them. Diagnosis performance of chest x-ray (CXR) is compared to that of CT. Detailed interpretation of deep network is also performed to relate system outputs with CT presentations. The code is available at https://github.com/ChenWWWeixiang/diagnosis_covid19 .", "This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance and the added value to radiologists of different levels of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the detection of thyroid cancers.\n303 patients who underwent thyroidectomy from October 2018 to July 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnostic performance of the senior radiologist, the junior radiologist, and the CAD system were compared. The added value of the CAD system was assessed and subgroup analyses were performed according to the size of thyroid nodules.\nIn total, 186 malignant thyroid nodules, and 179 benign thyroid nodules were included; 168 were papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 7 were medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 11 were follicular carcinoma (FTC), 127 were follicular adenoma (FA) and 52 were nodular goiters. The CAD system showed a comparable specificity as the senior radiologist (86.0% vs. 86.0%, p > 0.99), but a lower sensitivity and a lower area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve (sensitivity: 71.5% vs. 95.2%, p < 0.001; AUROC: 0.788 vs. 0.906, p < 0.001). The CAD system improved the diagnostic sensitivities of both the senior and the junior radiologists (97.8% vs. 95.2%, p = 0.063; 88.2% vs. 75.3%, p < 0.001).\nThe use of the CAD system using artificial intelligence is a potential tool to distinguish malignant thyroid nodules and is preferable to serve as a second opinion for less experienced radiologists to improve their diagnosis performance.", "Medical physics has made considerable contributions to recent advances in radiation oncology. Medical physicists are key players in the clinical and scientific radiation oncology context due to their unique skill sets, flexibility, clinical involvement and intrinsic translational character. The continuing development and widespread adoption of \"high-tech\" radiotherapy has led to an increased need for medical physics involvement. More recently, our field is rapidly changing towards an era of \"precision oncology\". These changes have opened new challenges for the definition of the professional and scientific roles and responsibilities of medical physicists. In this paper, we have identified four grand challenges of medical physics in radiation oncology: (1) improving target volume definition, (2) adoption of artificial intelligence and automation, (3) development of predictive models of biological effects for precision medicine, and (4) need for leadership. New visions and suggestions to orientate medical physics to successfully face these new challenges are summarized. We foresee that the scientific and professional challenges of our times are pushing medical physicists to accelerate toward multidisciplinarity. Medical physicists are expected to innovatively drive interactions and collaborations with other specialists outside radiation oncology while the radiation physics core will remain central. Medical physicists will retain strong and pivotal roles in quality, safety and in managing ever more complex technologies. The new challenges will require medical physicists to continuously update skills and innovate education, adapt curricula to include new fields, reinforce multi-disciplinary attitude and spirit of innovation. These challenges require visionary and open leadership, which is able to merge established roles with the exciting new fields where medical physics should increasingly contribute.", "Since the first fiberoptic instruments, gastrointestinal endoscopy has shaped the field of gastroenterology and is now a key diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Compared with the initial fiberoptic endoscopes state-of-the-art optical chips (or charge-coupled device technology) allowed a quantum leap in image quality. Despite these advances, gastrointestinal endoscopy is far from being perfect. The diagnostic yield (eg, for adenoma detection rates) is highly operator dependent and there is still the need for sedation or even anesthesia to address discomfort during the procedure. Despite highly standardized cleaning and high-level disinfection the reuse of contemporary (and difficult to clean) endoscopes with multiple channels exposes patients to the risk of transmission of infections. Artificial intelligence and pattern recognition should eliminate interindividual variability including polyp detection rates, self-propelled, and (potentially remotely controlled) scopes with a soft shaft could reduce the discomfort during procedures and abolish the need for sedation and anesthesia altogether and single-use designs should eliminate the risk of patient-to-patient transmission of infections. While these innovations are feasible and could be implemented rapidly utilizing available technology, they require a paradigm shift affecting all levels of the value chain from the supplier of the instruments to the end-users. Some may negate the need for a paradigm shift, but it is evident that a major redesign of the endoscopic equipment is overdue to fully utilize novel technologies and most importantly ensure the best possible outcomes for patients.", "The widely disseminated convergence in physical appearance hypothesis posits that long-term partners' facial appearance converges with time due to their shared environment, emotional mimicry, and synchronized activities. Although plausible, this hypothesis is incompatible with empirical findings pertaining to a wide range of other traits-such as personality, intelligence, attitudes, values, and well-being-in which partners show initial similarity but do not converge over time. We solve this conundrum by reexamining this hypothesis using the facial images of 517 couples taken at the beginning of their marriages and 20 to 69\u00a0years later. Using two independent methods of estimating their facial similarity (human judgment and a facial recognition algorithm), we show that while spouses' faces tend to be similar at the beginning of marriage, they do not converge over time, bringing facial appearance in line with other personal characteristics.", "Recent years have seen a rise of techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI). With that have also come initiatives for guidance on how to develop \"responsible AI\" aligned with human and ethical values. Compared to sectors like energy, healthcare, or transportation, the use of AI-based techniques in the water domain is relatively modest. This paper presents a review of current AI applications in the water domain and develops some tentative insights as to what \"responsible AI\" could mean there. Building on the reviewed literature, four categories of application are identified: modeling, prediction and forecasting, decision support and operational management, and optimization. We also identify three insights pertaining to the water sector in particular: the use of AI techniques in general, and many-objective optimization in particular, that allow for a pluralism of values and changing values; the use of theory-guided data science, which can avoid some of the pitfalls of strictly data-driven models; and the ability to build on experiences with participatory decision-making in the water sector. These insights suggest that the development and application of responsible AI techniques for the water sector should not be left to data scientists alone, but requires concerted effort by water professionals and data scientists working together, complemented with expertise from the social sciences and humanities.", "Modern agriculture and food production systems are facing increasing pressures from climate change, land and water availability, and, more recently, a pandemic. These factors are threatening the environmental and economic sustainability of current and future food supply systems. Scientific and technological innovations are needed more than ever to secure enough food for a fast-growing global population. Scientific advances have led to a better understanding of how various components of the agricultural system interact, from the cell to the field level. Despite incredible advances in genetic tools over the past few decades, our ability to accurately assess crop status in the field, at scale, has been severely lacking until recently. Thanks to recent advances in remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), we can now quantify field scale phenotypic information accurately and integrate the big data into predictive and prescriptive management tools. This review focuses on the use of recent technological advances in remote sensing and AI to improve the resilience of agricultural systems, and we will present a unique opportunity for the development of prescriptive tools needed to address the next decade's agricultural and human nutrition challenges.", "The use of imaging data has been reported to be useful for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. Although computed tomography (CT) scans show a variety of signs caused by the viral infection, given a large amount of images, these visual features are difficult and can take a long time to be recognized by radiologists. Artificial intelligence methods for automated classification of COVID-19 on CT scans have been found to be very promising. However, current investigation of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for COVID-19 diagnosis using CT data is limited. This study presents an investigation on 16 pretrained CNNs for classification of COVID-19 using a large public database of CT scans collected from COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 subjects. The results show that, using only 6 epochs for training, the CNNs achieved very high performance on the classification task. Among the 16 CNNs, DenseNet-201, which is the deepest net, is the best in terms of accuracy, balance between sensitivity and specificity, [Formula: see text] score, and area under curve. Furthermore, the implementation of transfer learning with the direct input of whole image slices and without the use of data augmentation provided better classification rates than the use of data augmentation. Such a finding alleviates the task of data augmentation and manual extraction of regions of interest on CT images, which are adopted by current implementation of deep-learning models for COVID-19 classification.", "Recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) led to effective methods and tools for analyzing the human behavior. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is one of the fields that has seen an explosive research interest among the ML community due to its wide range of applications. HAR is one of the most helpful technology tools to support the elderly's daily life and to help people suffering from cognitive disorders, Parkinson's disease, dementia, etc. It is also very useful in areas such as transportation, robotics and sports. Deep learning (DL) is a branch of ML based on complex Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that has demonstrated a high level of accuracy and performance in HAR. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are two types of DL models widely used in the recent years to address the HAR problem. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of their integration in recognizing daily activities, e.g., walking. We analyze four hybrid models that integrate CNNs with four powerful RNNs, i.e., LSTMs, BiLSTMs, GRUs and BiGRUs. The outcomes of our experiments on the PAMAP2 dataset indicate that our proposed hybrid models achieve an outstanding level of performance with respect to several indicative measures, e.g., F-score, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.", "The UK COVID-19 lockdown has included restricting social movement and interaction to slow the spread of disease and reduce demand on NHS acute services. It is likely that the impacts of restrictions will hit the least advantaged disproportionately and will worsen existing structural inequalities amongst deprived and ethnic minority groups. The aim of this study is to deliver rapid intelligence to enable an effective COVID-19 response, including co-production of interventions, that address key issues in the City of Bradford, UK, and nationally. In the longer term we aim to understand the impacts of the response on health trajectories and inequalities in these. In this paper we describe our approach and protocol. We plan an adaptive longitudinal mixed methods approach embedded with Born in Bradford (BiB) birth cohorts which have rich existing data (including questionnaire, routine health and biobank). All work packages (WP) interact and are ongoing. WP1 uses co-production and engagement methods with communities, decision-makers and researchers to continuously set (changing) research priorities and will, longer-term, co-produce interventions to aid the City's recovery. In WP2 repeated quantitative surveys will be administered during lockdown (April-June 2020), with three repeat surveys until 12 months post-lockdown with an ethnically diverse pool of BiB participants (parents, children aged 9-13 years, pregnant women: total sample pool N=7,652, N=5,154, N=1,800). A range of health, social, economic and education outcomes will be assessed. In WP3 priority topics identified in WP1 and WP2 will be explored qualitatively. Initial priority topics include children's mental wellbeing, health beliefs and the peri/post-natal period. Feedback loops will ensure findings are fed directly to decision-makers and communities (via WP1) to enable co-production of acceptable interventions and identify future priority topic areas. Findings will be used to aid development of local and national policy to support recovery from the pandemic and minimise health inequalities.", "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer diseases in women. The rapid and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer is of great significance for the treatment of cancer. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are used to identify breast malignant tumors, which can effectively solve the problems of insufficient recognition accuracy and long time-consuming in traditional breast cancer diagnosis methods. To solve these problems, we proposed a method of attribute selection and feature extraction based on random forest (RF) combined with principal component analysis (PCA) for rapid and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer. Firstly, RF was used to reduce 30 attributes of breast cancer categorical data. According to the average importance of attributes and out of bag error, 21 relatively important attribute data were selected for feature extraction based on PCA. The seven features extracted from PCA were used to establish an extreme learning machine (ELM) classification model with different activation functions. By comparing the classification accuracy and training time of these different models, the activation function of the hidden layer was determined as the sigmoid function. When the number of neurons in the hidden layer was 27, the accuracy of the test set was 98.75%, the accuracy of the training set was 99.06%, and the training time was only 0.0022 s. Finally, in order to verify the superiority of this method in breast cancer diagnosis, we compared with the ELM model based on the original breast cancer data and other intelligent classification algorithm models. The algorithm used in this article has a faster recognition time and a higher recognition accuracy than other algorithms. We also used the breast cancer data of breast tissue reactance features to verify the reliability of this method, and ideal results were obtained. The experimental results show that RF-PCA combined with ELM can significantly reduce the time required for the diagnosis of breast cancer, which has the ability of rapid and accurate identification of breast cancer and provides a theoretical basis for the intelligent diagnosis of breast cancer.", "Individuals who are intelligent concerning their emotions should experience them differently. In particular, being conversant with the valence dimension that is key to emotions should reasonably result in emotional experiences that are more bipolar with respect to this dimension. Pursuant of these ideas, three studies (total N\u2009=\u2009335) assessed emotional intelligence in ability-related terms (ability EI). The same participants also reported on their recent experiences of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) at work (studies 1 and 2) and/or their day-to-day emotional experiences within a daily diary protocol (study 3). Within each of these studies, ability EI moderated the relationship between experiences of PA and NA, such that the PA-NA relationship was more bipolar at higher levels of EI. These findings are discussed with respect to their implications for debates about bipolarity as well as for their value in highlighting ways in which the ability EI dimension operates.", "The traditional Scoring-Based Peer Review system has been the predominant radiology performance quality assurance model, which can become a condemning, ineffective process. In 2015, the Institute of Medicine called for \"policies and practices that promote a non-punitive culture that values open discussion and feedback on diagnostic performance.\" The development of Peer Learning (PL), a process that encompasses peer feedback, learning, and improvement, has positively impacted radiology through the recognition of success, identification of mistakes as learning opportunities, and development of a professional culture of trust. Furthermore, collective intelligence advances the PL process within the learning community, optimizing the abilities of a group effort that outperform that of a single individual, especially in the setting of complex medical and diagnostic imaging decision-making. The objective of the review article is to highlight the collective intelligence aspect of PL program, which allows PL to be more effective than established peer review model.", "The advent of omics technologies has greatly improved our understanding of microbial biology, particularly in the last two decades. The field of microbial biofilms is, however, relatively new, consolidated in the 1980s. The morphogenic switching by microbes from planktonic to biofilm phenotype confers numerous survival advantages such as resistance to desiccation, antibiotics, biocides, ultraviolet radiation, and host immune responses, thereby complicating treatment strategies for pathogenic microorganisms. Hence, understanding the mechanisms governing the biofilm phenotype can result in efficient treatment strategies directed specifically against molecular markers mediating this process. The application of omics technologies for studying microbial biofilms is relatively less explored and holds great promise in furthering our understanding of biofilm biology. In this review, we provide an overview of the application of omics tools such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics as well as multi-omics approaches for studying microbial biofilms in the current literature. We also highlight how the use of omics tools directed at various stages of the biological information flow, from genes to metabolites, can be integrated via multi-omics platforms to provide a holistic view of biofilm biology. Following this, we propose a future artificial intelligence-based multi-omics platform that can predict the pathways associated with different biofilm phenotypes.", "A proposal of an updated system of the Organization of Scientific Biomedical Kowledge is presented, integrating the historical achievements in pathology from the 15th to the 21st century. Scientific understanding of disease (Human Biopathology) is actually acquired at consecutive levels: 1) Etiopathogenic, 2) Structural, 3) Physiopathological, and 4) Clinical. A complete spectrum of etiological factors is presented. A new organization of the structural basis of disease processes (Human Structural Biopathology) is presented. Two unique polar types of cellular pathology are proposed: cellular injury and cellular change. Translation of these two types of cellular pathology into the integrative structural cytotissular levels, gives rise to only ten basic structural processes, that can be organized in three main cytotissular (CT) structural complexes: 1) CT maldevelopment that includes: congenital malformation(1), tumoral maldevelopment (2), hereditary non malformative congenital organopathy (3). 2) Complex of CT injury or non-hereditary organopathies (4), associating: CT necrosis-inflammatory reaction- repair. 3. complex of CT change: atrophy (5), hypertrophy (6), hyperplasia (7), metaplasia (8), dysplasia (9) and neoplasia (10). This system provides a precise basis for the organization of Human Biopathology, which could be applied to: 1) the development of a Universal Medical Curriculum, 2) Departamental Organization of a Faculty of Medicine, 3) the development of a New Global System for Disease Control. As we enter the era of Big Data, 5G, digitalization and artificial intelligence, a rational, scientific and efficient organization of biomedical information will be crucial in determining the success or failure of its applications to the health system.", "Stem Cells (SCs) show a wide range of applications in the treatment of numerous diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, etc. SC related research has gained popularity owing to the unique characteristics of self-renewal and differentiation. Artificial Intelligence (AI), an emerging field of computer science and engineering, has shown potential applications in different fields like robotics, agriculture, home automation, healthcare, banking, and transportation since its invention. This review aims to describe the various applications of AI in SC biology, including understanding the behavior of SCs, recognizing individual cell type before undergoing differentiation, characterization of SCs using mathematical models and prediction of mortality risk associated with SC transplantation. This review emphasizes the role of neural networks in SC biology and further elucidates the concepts of machine learning and deep learning and their applications in SC research.", "As a common mental health problem, social anxiety refers to the fear and avoidance of interacting in social or performance situations, which plays a crucial role in many health and social problems. Although a growing body of studies has explored the neuroanatomical alterations related to social anxiety in clinical patients, far fewer have examined the association between social anxiety and brain morphology in the general population, which may help us understand the neural underpinnings of social anxiety more comprehensively. Here, utilizing a voxel-based morphometry approach via structural magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated brain gray matter correlates of social anxiety in 231 recent graduates of the same high school grade. We found that social anxiety was positively associated with gray matter volume in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), which is a core brain area for cognitive processing of emotions and feelings. Critically, emotional intelligence mediated the impact of right MTG volume on social anxiety. Notably, our results persisted even when controlling for the effects of general anxiety and depression. Altogether, our research reveals right MTG gray matter volume as a neurostructural correlate of social anxiety in a general sample of adolescents and suggests a potential indirect effect of emotional intelligence on the association between gray matter volume and social anxiety.", "Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) such as bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia (SZ) and mood disorder (MD) are hard to manage due to overlapping symptoms and lack of biomarkers. Risk alleles of BD/SZ/MD are emerging, with evidence suggesting mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction as a critical factor for disease onset and progression. Mood stabilizing treatments for these disorders are scarce, revealing the need for biomarker discovery and artificial intelligence approaches to design synthetically accessible novel therapeutics. Here, we show mt involvement in NPDs by associating 245 mt proteins to BD/SZ/MD, with 7 common players in these disease categories. Analysis of over 650 publications suggests that 245 NPD-linked mt proteins are associated with 800 other mt proteins, with mt impairment likely to rewire these interactions. High dosage of mood stabilizers is known to alleviate manic episodes, but which compounds target mt pathways is another gap in the field that we address through mood stabilizer-gene interaction analysis of 37 prescriptions and over-the-counter psychotropic treatments, which we have refined to 15 mood-stabilizing agents. We show 26 of the 245 NPD-linked mt proteins are uniquely or commonly targeted by one or more of these mood stabilizers. Further, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived patient neurons and three-dimensional human brain organoids as reliable BD/SZ/MD models are outlined, along with multiomics methods and machine learning-based decision making tools for biomarker discovery, which remains a bottleneck for precision psychiatry medicine.", "Using social media applications in pediatric education is not outdated, and its effectiveness has not been tested yet. For this reason, we shared the first results of the Pediatric Atelier experience that we realized through telegram application. We make an online survey to investigate the needs, requirements, pleasure, and suggestions of members through a web-based questionnaire. This cross-sectional survey study was delivered only to participants who were members of the workshop via their email addresses. Online questionnaires organized using Google Forms were sent to pediatric workshop members between March and June 2019. The questionnaire consisted of questions that measured the participants' basic demographic data, the use of the workshop, and the overall impact of the workshop on their professional behavior. While the institutions and positions of the participants were recorded, no other personal data (such as address and telephone) were collected. Among the 997 members, 417 (42%) of them answered the questionnaire. Respondents included 300 (72%) pediatrician, 21 (5%) pediatric subspeciality fellows, and 75 (18%) pediatric subspecialists. Of the 417 respondents, 217 (52%) were working in Istanbul, and 200 (48%) were working in other cities of Turkey. Among the responders, 233 (56%) were working in private hospitals or doctor offices. A total of 520 cases were consulted in 241 days of study period. Most consultations (n = 309, %59) were made from the Istanbul metropolitan area, and 203 (40%) consultations were from other cities of Turkey. The most frequently consulted departments were Pediatric infectious diseases: 166 (32%), Pediatric hematology and oncology: 56 (11%), and Neonatology: 43 (8%). Of the 520 consulted cases, 44 (8%) were related to life-threatening events, and 25 of them were hospitalized in the intensive care units, and 6 of them were required surgical operations. Of the 94% of responders thought this platform was useful and 82% of them stated that the case counseling part of the atelier was the most useful part. We think that the development of technology and artificial intelligence may lead to the usage of on-line platforms or systems in clinical medical practice. Clinical Trial Registration (if any). Registry name, registration number, web link to study on registry, and data sharing statement.", "There is great potential for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, especially machine learning and natural language processing, in medical imaging. Much attention has been garnered by the image analysis tasks for diagnostic decision support and precision medicine, but there are many other potential applications of AI in radiology and have potential to enhance all levels of the radiology workflow and practice, including workflow optimization and support for interpretation tasks, quality and safety, and operational efficiency. This article reviews the important potential applications of informatics and AI related to process improvement and operations in the radiology department.", "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease of the elderly, which leads to patients' motor and non-motor disabilities and affects patients' quality of daily life. Timely and effective detection of PD is a key step to medical intervention. Recently, computer aided methods for PD detection have gained lots of attention in artificial intelligence domain.\nThis paper proposed a novel ensemble learning model fusing Random Forest (RF) classifiers and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to differentiate PD patients from healthy controls (HC). Six different RF models were separately constructed to generate the corresponding class probability vectors which represent an individual's category predictions on 6 different handwritten exams, and the final prediction result for an individual was obtained through voting strategy of all RF models. Stratified k-fold cross validation was performed to split the exam datasets and evaluate the classification performances.\nExperimental results prove that our proposed ensemble model on six handwritten exams has achieved better classification performances than a single RF based method on a single handwritten exam. Our ensemble of RF model based on multiple handwritten exams has promising accuracy (89.4 %), specificity (93.7 %), sensitivity (84.5 %) and F1-score (87.7 %). Compared with Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), the ensemble model based on RF can achieve better classification results.\nA computer-assisted PD diagnosis model on small handwritten dynamics dataset is proposed, and it provides a potential way for assisting diagnosis of PD in clinical setting.", "The advent of big data and deep learning algorithms has promoted a major shift toward data-driven methods in medical image analysis recently. However, the medical image analysis field has a long and rich history inclusive of both knowledge-driven and data-driven methodologies. In the present article, we provide a historical review of an illustrative sample of medical image analysis methods and locate them along a knowledge-driven versus data-driven continuum. In doing so, we highlight the historical importance as well as current-day relevance of more traditional, knowledge-based artificial intelligence approaches and their complementarity with fully data-driven techniques such as deep learning.", "The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has contaminated millions of people, resulting in high fatality rates. Recently emerging artificial intelligence technologies like the convolutional neural network (CNN) are strengthening the power of imaging tools and can help medical specialists. CNN combined with other sensors creates a new solution to fight COVID-19 transmission. This paper presents a novel method to detect coughs (an important symptom of COVID-19) using a K-band continuous-wave Doppler radar with most popular CNNs architectures: AlexNet, VGG-19, and GoogLeNet. The proposed method has cough detection test accuracy of 88.0% using AlexNet CNN with people 1 m away from the microwave radar sensor, test accuracy of 80.0% with people 3 m away from the radar sensor, and test accuracy of 86.5% with a single mixed dataset with people 1 m and 3 m away from the radar sensor. The K-band radar sensor is inexpensive, completely camera-free and collects no personally-identifying information, allaying privacy concerns while still providing in-depth public health data on individual, local, and national levels. Additionally, the measurements are conducted without human contact, making the process proposed in this work safe for the investigation of contagious diseases such as COVID-19. The proposed cough detection system using microwave radar sensor has environmental robustness and dark/light-independence, unlike traditional cameras. The proposed microwave radar sensor can be used alone or in group with other sensors in a fusion sensor system to create a robust system to detect cough and other movements, mainly if using CNNs.", "Although prior studies showed a correlation between environmental manganese (Mn) exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders in children, the results have been inconclusive. There has yet been no consistent biomarker of environmental Mn exposure. Here, we summarized studies that investigated associations between manganese in biomarkers and childhood neurodevelopment and suggest a reliable biomarker.\nWe searched PubMed and Web of Science for potentially relevant articles published until December 31th 2019 in English. We also conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the effects of manganese exposure on Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and the correlations of manganese in different indicators.\nOf 1754 citations identified, 55 studies with 13,388 subjects were included. Evidence from cohort studies found that higher manganese exposure had a negative effect on neurodevelopment, mostly influencing cognitive and motor skills in children under 6\u2009years of age, as indicated by various metrics. Results from cross-sectional studies revealed that elevated Mn in hair (H-Mn) and drinking water (W-Mn), but not blood (B-Mn) or teeth (T-Mn), were associated with poorer cognitive and behavioral performance in children aged 6-18\u2009years old. Of these cross-sectional studies, most papers reported that the mean of H-Mn was more than 0.55\u2009\u03bcg/g. The meta-analysis concerning H-Mn suggested that a 10-fold increase in hair manganese was associated with a decrease of 2.51 points (95% confidence interval (CI), -\u20094.58, -\u20090.45) in Full Scale IQ, while the meta-analysis of B-Mn and W-Mn generated no such significant effects. The pooled correlation analysis revealed that H-Mn showed a more consistent correlation with W-Mn than B-Mn. Results regarding sex differences of manganese associations were inconsistent, although the preliminary meta-analysis found that higher W-Mn was associated with better Performance IQ only in boys, at a relatively low water manganese concentrations (most below 50\u2009\u03bcg/L).\nHigher manganese exposure is adversely associated with childhood neurodevelopment. Hair is the most reliable indicator of manganese exposure for children at 6-18\u2009years of age. Analysis of the publications demonstrated sex differences in neurodevelopment upon manganese exposure, although a clear pattern has not yet been elucidated for this facet of our study.", "The SARS-CoV2 pandemic has impacted risk management globally. Blockchain has been increasingly applied to healthcare management, as a strategic tool to strengthen operative protocols and to create the proper basis for an efficient and effective evidence-based decisional process. We aim to validate blockchain in healthcare, and to suggest a trace-route for a COVID19-safe clinical practice. The use of blockchain in combination with artificial intelligence systems allows the creation of a generalizable predictive system that could contribute to the containment of pandemic risk on national territory. A SWOT analysis of the adoption of a blockchain-based prediction model in healthcare and SARS-CoV-2 infection has been carried out to underline opportunities and limits to its adoption. Blockchain could play a strategic role in future digital healthcare: specifically, it may work to improve COVID19-safe clinical practice. The main concepts, and particularly those related to clinical workflow, obtainable from different blockchain-based models have been reported here and critically discussed.", "The hype around artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology continues unabated, despite the fact that the exact role AI will play in future radiology practice remains undefined. Nevertheless, education of the radiologists of the future is ongoing and needs to account for the uncertainty of this new technology. Radiology residency training has evolved even before the recent advent of imaging AI. Yet radiology residents and fellows will likely one day experience the benefits of an AI-enabled clinical training. This will offer them a customized learning experience and the ability to analyze large quantities of data about their progress in residency, with substantially less manual effort than is currently required. Additionally, they will need to learn how to interact with AI tools in clinical practice and, more importantly, understand how to evaluate AI outputs in a critical fashion as yet another piece of information contributing to the interpretation of an imaging examination. Although the exact role AI will play in the future practice of radiology remains undefined, it will surely be integrated into the education of future radiologists.", "To develop a deep learning (DL) model to detect morphologic patterns of diabetic macular edema (DME) based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.\nIn the training set, 12,365 OCT images were extracted from a public data set and an ophthalmic center. A total of 656 OCT images were extracted from another ophthalmic center for external validation. The presence or absence of three OCT patterns of DME, including diffused retinal thickening, cystoid macular edema, and serous retinal detachment, was labeled with 1 or 0, respectively. A DL model was trained to detect three OCT patterns of DME. The occlusion test was applied for the visualization of the DL model.\nApplying 5-fold cross-validation method in internal validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection of three OCT patterns (i.e., diffused retinal thickening, cystoid macular edema, and serous retinal detachment) was 0.971, 0.974, and 0.994, respectively, with an accuracy of 93.0%, 95.1%, and 98.8%, respectively, a sensitivity of 93.5%, 94.5%, and 96.7%, respectively, and a specificity of 92.3%, 95.6%, and 99.3%, respectively. In external validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.970, 0.997, and 0.997, respectively, with an accuracy of 90.2%, 95.4%, and 95.9%, respectively, a sensitivity of 80.1%, 93.4%, and 94.9%, respectively, and a specificity of 97.6%, 97.2%, and 96.5%, respectively. The occlusion test showed that the DL model could successfully identify the pathologic regions most critical for detection.\nOur DL model demonstrated high accuracy and transparency in the detection of OCT patterns of DME. These results emphasized the potential of artificial intelligence in assisting clinical decision-making processes in patients with DME.", "Surgical training has dramatically changed over the last decade. It has become not only the way to prepare surgeons for their everyday work, but also a way to certify their skills thus increasing patient safety. This article reviews advances in the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence applied to virtual reality based surgical training over the last 5 years.\nEight articles have been published which met the inclusion criteria. This included six articles about the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence for assessment purposes and two articles about the possibility of teaching applications, including one review and one original research article. All the research articles pointed out the importance of machine learning and artificial intelligence for the stratification of trainees, based on their performance on basic tasks or procedures simulated in a virtual reality environment.\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence are designed to analyse data and use them to take decisions that typically require human intelligence. Evidence in literature is still scarce about this technology applied to virtual reality and existing manuscripts are mainly focused on its potential to stratify surgical performance and provide synthetic feedbacks about it. In consideration of the exponential growth of computer calculation capabilities, it is possible to expect a parallel increase of research about this topic within the next few years.", "The classification of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 4A (BI-RADS 4A) lesions is mostly based on the personal experience of doctors and lacks specific and clear classification standards. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) provides a new method for BI-RADS categorisation. We analysed the ultrasonic morphological and texture characteristics of BI-RADS 4A benign and malignant lesions using AI, and these ultrasonic characteristics of BI-RADS 4A benign and malignant lesions were compared to examine the value of AI in the differential diagnosis of BI-RADS 4A benign and malignant lesions.\nA total of 206 lesions of BI-RADS 4A examined using ultrasonography were analysed retrospectively, including 174 benign lesions and 32 malignant lesions. All of the lesions were contoured manually, and the ultrasonic morphological and texture features of the lesions, such as circularity, height-to-width ratio, margin spicules, margin coarseness, margin indistinctness, margin lobulation, energy, entropy, grey mean, internal calcification and angle between the long axis of the lesion and skin, were calculated using grey level gradient co-occurrence matrix analysis. Differences between benign and malignant lesions of BI-RADS 4A were analysed.\nSignificant differences in margin lobulation, entropy, internal calcification and ALS were noted between the benign group and malignant group (P\u2009=\u20090.013, 0.045, 0.045, and 0.002, respectively). The malignant group had more margin lobulations and lower entropy compared with the benign group, and the benign group had more internal calcifications and a greater angle between the long axis of the lesion and skin compared with the malignant group. No significant differences in circularity, height-to-width ratio, margin spicules, margin coarseness, margin indistinctness, energy, and grey mean were noted between benign and malignant lesions.\nCompared with the naked eye, AI can reveal more subtle differences between benign and malignant BI-RADS 4A lesions. These results remind us carefully observation of the margin and the internal echo is of great significance. With the help of morphological and texture information provided by AI, doctors can make a more accurate judgment on such atypical benign and malignant lesions.", "In this meta-study, we analyzed 2442 effect sizes from 131 meta-analyses in intelligence research, published from 1984 to 2014, to estimate the average effect size, median power, and evidence for bias. We found that the average effect size in intelligence research was a Pearson's correlation of 0.26, and the median sample size was 60. Furthermore, across primary studies, we found a median power of 11.9% to detect a small effect, 54.5% to detect a medium effect, and 93.9% to detect a large effect. We documented differences in average effect size and median estimated power between different types of intelligence studies (correlational studies, studies of group differences, experiments, toxicology, and behavior genetics). On average, across all meta-analyses (but not in every meta-analysis), we found evidence for small-study effects, potentially indicating publication bias and overestimated effects. We found no differences in small-study effects between different study types. We also found no convincing evidence for the decline effect, US effect, or citation bias across meta-analyses. We concluded that intelligence research does show signs of low power and publication bias, but that these problems seem less severe than in many other scientific fields.", "Macphail's comparative approach to intelligence focused on associative processes, an orientation inconsistent with more multifaceted lay and scientific understandings of the term. His ultimate emphasis on associative processes indicated few differences in intelligence among vertebrates. We explore options more attuned to common definitions by considering intelligence in terms of richness of representations of the world, the interconnectivity of those representations, the ability to flexibly change those connections, and knowledge. We focus on marine mammals, represented by the amphibious pinnipeds and the aquatic cetaceans and sirenians, as animals that transitioned from a terrestrial existence to an aquatic one, experiencing major changes in ecological pressures. They adapted with morphological transformations related to streamlining the body, physiological changes in respiration and thermoregulation, and sensory/perceptual changes, including echolocation capabilities and diminished olfaction in many cetaceans, both in-air and underwater visual focus, and enhanced senses of touch in pinnipeds and sirenians. Having a terrestrial foundation on which aquatic capacities were overlaid likely affected their cognitive abilities, especially as a new reliance on sound and touch, and the need to surface to breath changed their interactions with the world. Vocal and behavioral observational learning capabilities in the wild and in laboratory experiments suggest versatility in group coordination. Empirical reports on aspects of intelligent behavior like problem-solving, spatial learning, and concept learning by various species of cetaceans and pinnipeds suggest rich cognitive abilities. The high energy demands of the brain suggest that brain-intelligence relationships might be fruitful areas for study when specific hypotheses are considered, e.g., brain mapping indicates hypertrophy of specific sensory areas in marine mammals. Modern neuroimaging techniques provide ways to study neural connectivity, and the patterns of connections between sensory, motor, and other cortical regions provide a biological framework for exploring how animals represent and flexibly use information in navigating and learning about their environment. At this stage of marine mammal research, it would still be prudent to follow Macphail's caution that it is premature to make strong comparative statements without more empirical evidence, but an approach that includes learning more about how animals flexibly link information across multiple representations could be a productive way of comparing species by allowing them to use their specific strengths within comparative tasks.", "The social intelligence hypothesis (SIH) posits that within-group interactions drive cognitive evolution, but it has received equivocal support. We argue the SIH overlooks a major component of social life: interactions with conspecific outsiders. Competition for vital resources means conspecific outsiders present myriad threats and opportunities in all animal taxa across the social spectrum (from individuals to groups). We detail cognitive challenges generated by conspecific outsiders,\u00a0arguing these select for 'Napoleonic' intelligence; explain potential influences on the SIH; and highlight important considerations when empirically testing these ideas. Including interactions with conspecific outsiders may substantially improve our understanding of cognitive evolution.", "Urban growth and land-use change are a few of many puzzling factors affecting our future cities. Creating a precise simulation for future land change is a challenging process that requires temporal and spatial modeling. Many recent studies developed and trained models to predict urban expansion patterns using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study aims to enhance the simulation capability of Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-MC) model in predicting changes in land-use. This study integrates the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into CA-MC to incorporate several driving forces that highly impact land-use change. The research utilizes different socio-economic, spatial, and environmental variables (slope, distance to road, distance to urban centers, distance to commercial, density, elevation, and land fertility) to generate potential transition maps using ANN Data-driven model. The generated maps are fed to CA-MC as additional inputs. We calibrated the original CA-MC and our models for 2015 cross-comparing simulated maps and actual maps obtained for Irbid city, Jordan in 2015. Validation of our model was assessed and compared to the CA-MC model using Kappa indices including the agreement in terms of quantity and location. The results elucidated that our model with an accuracy of 90.04% substantially outperforms CA-MC (86.29%) model. The improvement we obtained from integrating ANN with CA-MC suggested that the influence imposed by the driving force was necessary to be taken into account for more accurate prediction. In addition to the improved model prediction, the predicted maps of Irbid for the years 2021 and 2027 will guide local authorities in the development of management strategies that balance urban expansion and protect agricultural regions. This will play a vital role in sustaining Jordan's food security.", "To develop, and evaluate the performance of, a deep learning-based three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm aimed at finding needles in ultrasound images used in prostate brachytherapy.\nTransrectal ultrasound (TRUS) image volumes from 1102 treatments were used to create a clinical ground truth (CGT) including 24422 individual needles that had been manually digitized by medical physicists during brachytherapy procedures. A 3D CNN U-net with 128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0128 TRUS image volumes as input was trained using 17215 needle examples. Predictions of voxels constituting a needle were combined to yield a 3D linear function describing the localization of each needle in a TRUS volume. Manual and AI digitizations were compared in terms of the root-mean-square distance (RMSD) along each needle, expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). The method was evaluated on a data set including 7207 needle examples. A subgroup of the evaluation data set (n\u00a0=\u00a0188) was created, where the needles were digitized once more by a medical physicist (G1) trained in brachytherapy. The digitization procedure was timed.\nThe RMSD between the AI and CGT was 0.55 (IQR: 0.35-0.86) mm. In the smaller subset, the RMSD between AI and CGT was similar (0.52 [IQR: 0.33-0.79] mm) but significantly smaller (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) than the difference of 0.75 (IQR: 0.49-1.20) mm between AI and G1. The difference between CGT and G1 was 0.80 (IQR: 0.48-1.18) mm, implying that the AI performed as well as the CGT in relation to G1. The mean time needed for human digitization was 10 min 11 sec, while the time needed for the AI was negligible.\nA 3D CNN can be trained to identify needles in TRUS images. The performance of the network was similar to that of a medical physicist trained in brachytherapy. Incorporating a CNN for needle identification can shorten brachytherapy treatment procedures substantially.", "An artificial intelligence method could accelerate the clinical implementation of tumour-stroma ratio (TSR), which has prognostic relevance in colorectal cancer (CRC). We, therefore, developed a deep learning model for the fully automated TSR quantification on routine haematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained whole-slide images (WSI) and further investigated its prognostic validity for patient stratification.\nWe trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using transfer learning, with its nine-class tissue classification performance evaluated in two independent test sets. Patch-level segmentation on WSI HE slides was performed using the model, with TSR subsequently derived. A discovery (N=499) and validation cohort (N=315) were used to evaluate the prognostic value of TSR for overall survival (OS).\nThe CNN-quantified TSR was a prognostic factor, independently of other clinicopathologic characteristics, with stroma-high associated with reduced OS in the discovery (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.24-2.37, P=0.001) and validation cohort (2.08, 1.26-3.42, 0.004). Integrating TSR into a Cox model with other risk factors showed improved prognostic capability.\nWe developed a deep learning model to quantify TSR based on histologic WSI of CRC and demonstrated its prognostic validity for patient stratification for OS in two independent CRC patient cohorts. This fully automatic approach allows for the objective and standardised application while reducing pathologists' workload. Thus, it can potentially be of significant aid in clinical prognosis prediction and decision-making.\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China, National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholar, and National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China.", "Scarce or absent radiology resources impede adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) for medical imaging by resource-poor health institutions. They face limitations in local equipment, personnel expertise, infrastructure, data-rights frameworks, and public policies. The trustworthiness of AI for medical decision making in global health and low-resource settings is hampered by insufficient data diversity, nontransparent AI algorithms, and resource-poor health institutions' limited participation in AI production and validation. RAD-AID's three-pronged integrated strategy for AI adoption in resource-poor health institutions is presented, which includes clinical radiology education, infrastructure implementation, and phased AI introduction. This strategy derives from RAD-AID's more-than-a-decade experience as a nonprofit organization developing radiology in resource-poor health institutions, both in the United States and in low- and middle-income countries. The three components synergistically provide the foundation to address health care disparities. Local radiology personnel expertise is augmented through comprehensive education. Software, hardware, and radiologic and networking infrastructure enables radiology workflows incorporating AI. These educational and infrastructure developments occur while RAD-AID delivers phased introduction, testing, and scaling of AI via global health collaborations.", "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, and the limited availability of qualified ophthalmologists restricts its early diagnosis. For the past few years, artificial intelligence technology has developed rapidly and has been applied in DR screening. The upcoming technology provides support on DR screening and improves the identification of DR lesions with a high sensitivity and specificity. This review aims to summarize the progress on automatic detection and classification models for the diagnosis of DR.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) advancements have significant implications for medical imaging. Stroke is the leading cause of disability and the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. AI applications for stroke imaging are a topic of intense research. AI techniques are well-suited for dealing with vast amounts of stroke imaging data and a large number of multidisciplinary approaches used in classification, risk assessment, segmentation tasks, diagnosis, prognosis, and even prediction of therapy responses. This article addresses this topic and seeks to present an overview of machine learning and/or deep learning applied to stroke imaging.", "Chest radiography is the most common diagnostic imaging examination performed in emergency departments (EDs). Augmenting clinicians with automated preliminary read assistants could help expedite their workflows, improve accuracy, and reduce the cost of care.\nTo assess the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in realistic radiology workflows by performing an objective comparative evaluation of the preliminary reads of anteroposterior (AP) frontal chest radiographs performed by an AI algorithm and radiology residents.\nThis diagnostic study included a set of 72 findings assembled by clinical experts to constitute a full-fledged preliminary read of AP frontal chest radiographs. A novel deep learning architecture was designed for an AI algorithm to estimate the findings per image. The AI algorithm was trained using a multihospital training data set of 342\u202f126 frontal chest radiographs captured in ED and urgent care settings. The training data were labeled from their associated reports. Image-based F1 score was chosen to optimize the operating point on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve so as to minimize the number of missed findings and overcalls per image read. The performance of the model was compared with that of 5 radiology residents recruited from multiple institutions in the US in an objective study in which a separate data set of 1998 AP frontal chest radiographs was drawn from a hospital source representative of realistic preliminary reads in inpatient and ED settings. A triple consensus with adjudication process was used to derive the ground truth labels for the study data set. The performance of AI algorithm and radiology residents was assessed by comparing their reads with ground truth findings. All studies were conducted through a web-based clinical study application system. The triple consensus data set was collected between February and October 2018. The comparison study was preformed between January and October 2019. Data were analyzed from October to February 2020. After the first round of reviews, further analysis of the data was performed from March to July 2020.\nThe learning performance of the AI algorithm was judged using the conventional ROC curve and the area under the curve (AUC) during training and field testing on the study data set. For the AI algorithm and radiology residents, the individual finding label performance was measured using the conventional measures of label-based sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV). In addition, the agreement with the ground truth on the assignment of findings to images was measured using the pooled \u03ba statistic. The preliminary read performance was recorded for AI algorithm and radiology residents using new measures of mean image-based sensitivity, specificity, and PPV designed for recording the fraction of misses and overcalls on a per image basis. The 1-sided analysis of variance test was used to compare the means of each group (AI algorithm vs radiology residents) using the F distribution, and the null hypothesis was that the groups would have similar means.\nThe trained AI algorithm achieved a mean AUC across labels of 0.807 (weighted mean AUC, 0.841) after training. On the study data set, which had a different prevalence distribution, the mean AUC achieved was 0.772 (weighted mean AUC, 0.865). The interrater agreement with ground truth finding labels for AI algorithm predictions had pooled \u03ba value of 0.544, and the pooled \u03ba for radiology residents was 0.585. For the preliminary read performance, the analysis of variance test was used to compare the distributions of AI algorithm and radiology residents' mean image-based sensitivity, PPV, and specificity. The mean image-based sensitivity for AI algorithm was 0.716 (95% CI, 0.704-0.729) and for radiology residents was 0.720 (95% CI, 0.709-0.732) (P\u2009=\u2009.66), while the PPV was 0.730 (95% CI, 0.718-0.742) for the AI algorithm and 0.682 (95% CI, 0.670-0.694) for the radiology residents (P\u2009<\u2009.001), and specificity was 0.980 (95% CI, 0.980-0.981) for the AI algorithm and 0.973 (95% CI, 0.971-0.974) for the radiology residents (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nThese findings suggest that it is possible to build AI algorithms that reach and exceed the mean level of performance of third-year radiology residents for full-fledged preliminary read of AP frontal chest radiographs. This diagnostic study also found that while the more complex findings would still benefit from expert overreads, the performance of AI algorithms was associated with the amount of data available for training rather than the level of difficulty of interpretation of the finding. Integrating such AI systems in radiology workflows for preliminary interpretations has the potential to expedite existing radiology workflows and address resource scarcity while improving overall accuracy and reducing the cost of care.", "Synthetic cathinones constitute a major class of the new psychoactive substances (NPS) that have come to dominate recreational drug abuse in recent years. As synthetic cathinones are all chiral molecules, the use of chiral analysis to determine their enantiomeric ratios (ER) in seized drug samples can assist in the identification of the precursor chemicals and manufacturing processes used in production, thereby contributing to drug intelligence. In addition, as different enantiomers of synthetic cathinones vary in biological activity and toxicology, chiral analysis can support research into the physiological properties and side effects of seized drugs, thus enabling better treatment for overdose or addiction. Therefore, suitable methods for chiral separation and quantitative analysis of synthetic cathinones in forensic laboratories are needed. This study describes the separation of R- and S-enantiomers of methylone and ethylone, two of the most commonly abused synthetic cathinones, by liquid chromatography (LC) using a Lux AMP polysaccharide-based chiral column, followed by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Enantiomeric separation was achieved in 13.4min, and the precision, accuracy, carryover, detection limit, and quantification limit of this method were determined. A total of 39 seized drug samples were analyzed in this study, and the results yielded ER of 0.97-1.09 for methylone and 0.87-1.17 for ethylone. The purity of methylone or ethylone was lower in instant coffee bags than in other package types. The ER and purity profiles can be useful for forensic science and drug intelligence.", "There is significant variation in lay people's beliefs about the nature of intelligence: Some believe that intelligence is relatively fixed and innate, whereas others view intelligence as more malleable and affected by experience. However, most studies in this domain do not explicitly define intelligence when probing about beliefs about intelligence and aptitude. Thus, variation in beliefs may reflect variation in how intelligence is defined. To address this issue, we conducted 3 studies examining individuals' beliefs about fluid versus crystallized intelligence. Study 1 used a modified version of Dweck's (1999) mindset questionnaire and found that people have more fixed views about fluid intelligence than either crystallized intelligence or intelligence in general. Study 2 used a switched-at-birth paradigm and found that individuals hold more essentialist beliefs about fluid intelligence than crystallized intelligence. Study 3 added a survey that probed participants' beliefs about mathematics achievement. It found that when reasoning about mathematics achievements, participants' attributions of ability and effort were differentially associated with their crystallized and fluid mindset beliefs. Specifically, mindsets of fluid intelligence were more associated with effort for professional-level mathematics achievements, whereas mindsets of crystallized intelligence were more associated with elementary-level mathematics achievements. Together, the present studies highlight the importance of considering the definition of intelligence when assessing related beliefs about malleability, inheritance, and achievement.

Although effective interventions exist for common mental disorders that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period, most cases in low- and middle-income countries go untreated because of a lack of trained professionals. Task-sharing models such as the Thinking Healthy Program have shown potential in feasibility and efficacy trials as a strategy for expanding access to treatment in low-resource settings; however, there are significant barriers to scale-up. We address this gap by adapting Thinking Healthy for automated delivery via a mobile phone. This new intervention, Healthy Moms, uses an existing artificial intelligence system called Tess (Zuri in Kenya) to drive conversations with users.\nThis prepilot study aims to gather preliminary data on the Healthy Moms perinatal depression intervention to learn how to build and test a more robust service.\nWe conducted a single-case experimental design with pregnant women and new mothers recruited from public hospitals outside of Nairobi, Kenya. We invited these women to complete a brief, automated screening delivered via text messages to determine their eligibility. Enrolled participants were randomized to a 1- or 2-week baseline period and then invited to begin using Zuri. We prompted participants to rate their mood via SMS text messaging every 3 days during the baseline and intervention periods, and we used these preliminary repeated measures data to fit a linear mixed-effects model of response to treatment. We also reviewed system logs and conducted in-depth interviews with participants to study engagement with the intervention, feasibility, and acceptability.\nWe invited 647 women to learn more about Zuri: 86 completed our automated SMS screening and 41 enrolled in the study. Most of the enrolled women submitted at least 3 mood ratings (31/41, 76%) and sent at least 1 message to Zuri (27/41, 66%). A third of the sample engaged beyond registration (14/41, 34%). On average, women who engaged post registration started 3.4 (SD 3.2) Healthy Moms sessions and completed 3.1 (SD 2.9) of the sessions they started. Most interviewees who tried Zuri reported having a positive attitude toward the service and expressed trust in Zuri. They also attributed positive life changes to the intervention. We estimated that using this alpha version of Zuri may have led to a 7% improvement in mood.\nZuri is feasible to deliver via SMS and was acceptable to this sample of pregnant women and new mothers. The results of this prepilot study will serve as a baseline for future studies in terms of recruitment, data collection, and outcomes.\nRR2-10.2196/11800.", "The deterioration of the retina center could be the main reason for vision loss. Older people usually ranging from 50 years and above are exposed to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) disease that strikes the retina. The lack of human expertise to interpret the complexity in diagnosing diseases leads to the importance of developing an accurate method to detect and localize the targeted infection. Approaching the performance of ophthalmologists is the consistent main challenge in retinal disease segmentation. Artificial intelligence techniques have shown enormous achievement in various tasks in computer vision. This paper depicts an automated end-to-end deep neural network for retinal disease segmentation on optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. The work proposed in this study shows the performance difference between convolution operations and atrous convolution operations. Three deep semantic segmentation architectures, namely U-net, Segnet, and Deeplabv3+, have been considered to evaluate the performance of varying convolution operations. Empirical outcomes show a competitive performance to the human level, with an average dice score of 0.73 for retinal diseases.", "Background and study aims \u2002Early studies have shown that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to augment the performance of gastroenterologists during endoscopy. Our aim was to determine how gastroenterologists view the potential role of AI in gastrointestinal endoscopy. Methods\u2002 In this cross-sectional study, an online survey was sent to US gastroenterologists. The survey included questions about physician level of training, experience, and practice characteristics and physician perception of AI. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sentiment about AI. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess whether background information about physicians correlated to their sentiment. Results \u2002Surveys were emailed to 330 gastroenterologists nationwide. Between December 2018 and January 2019, 124 physicians (38\u200a%) completed the survey. Eighty-six percent of physicians reported interest in AI-assisted colonoscopy; 84.7\u200a% agreed that computer-assisted polyp detection (CADe) would improve their endoscopic performance. Of the respondents, 57.2\u200a% felt comfortable using computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) to support a \"diagnose and leave\" strategy for hyperplastic polyps. Multivariate analysis showed that post-fellowship experience of fewer than 15 years was the most important factor in determining whether physicians were likely to believe that CADe would lead to more removed polyps (odds ratio\u200a=\u200a5.09; P \u200a=\u200a.01). The most common concerns about implementation of AI were cost (75.2\u200a%), operator dependence (62.8\u200a%), and increased procedural time (60.3\u200a%). Conclusions \u2002Gastroenterologists have strong interest in the application of AI to colonoscopy, particularly with regard to CADe for polyp detection. The primary concerns were its cost, potential to increase procedural time, and potential to develop operator dependence. Future developments in AI should prioritize mitigation of these concerns.", "Processed food has become an indispensable part of the human food chain. It provides rich nutrition for human health and satisfies various other requirements for food consumption. However, establishing traceability systems for processed food faces a different set of challenges compared to primary agro-food, because of the variety of raw materials, batch mixing, and resource transformation. In this paper, progress in the traceability of processed food is reviewed. Based on an analysis of the food supply chain and processing stage, the problem of traceability in food processing results from the transformations that the resources go through. Methods to implement traceability in food processing, including physical separation in different lots, defining and associating batches, isotope analysis and DNA tracking, statistical data models, internal traceability system development, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain-based approaches are summarized. Traceability is evaluated based on recall effects, TRUs (traceable resource units), and comprehensive granularity. Different methods have different advantages and disadvantages. The combined application of different methods should consider the specific application scenarios in food processing to improve granularity. On the other hand, novel technologies, including batch mixing optimization with AI, quality forecasting with big data, and credible traceability with blockchain, are presented in the context of improving traceability performance in food processing.", "In an increasingly data-driven world, artificial intelligence is expected to be a key tool for converting big data into tangible benefits and the healthcare domain is no exception to this. Machine learning aims to identify complex patterns in multi-dimensional data and use these uncovered patterns to classify new unseen cases or make data-driven predictions. In recent years, deep neural networks have shown to be capable of producing results that considerably exceed those of conventional machine learning methods for various classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we provide an accessible tutorial of the most important supervised machine learning concepts and methods, including deep learning, which are potentially the most relevant for the medical domain. We aim to take some of the mystery out of machine learning and depict how machine learning models can be useful for medical applications. Finally, this tutorial provides a few practical suggestions for how to properly design a machine learning model for a generic medical problem.", "Increasing incidence of skin cancer combined with a shortage of dermatopathologists has increased the workload of pathology departments worldwide. In addition, the high intraobserver and interobserver variability in the assessment of melanocytic skin lesions can result in underestimated or overestimated diagnosis of melanoma. Thus, the development of new techniques for skin tumor diagnosis is essential to assist pathologists to standardize diagnoses and plan accurate patient treatment. Here, we describe the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) system that recognizes cutaneous melanoma from histopathological digitalized slides with clinically acceptable accuracy. Whole-slide digital images from 100 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary cutaneous melanoma were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on a pretrained Inception-ResNet-v2 to accurately and automatically differentiate tumoral areas from healthy tissue. The CNN was trained by using 60 digital slides in which regions of interest (ROIs) of tumoral and healthy tissue were extracted by experienced dermatopathologists, while the other 40 slides were used as test datasets. A total of 1377 patches of healthy tissue and 2141 patches of melanoma were assessed in the training/validation set, while 791 patches of healthy tissue and 1122 patches of pathological tissue were evaluated in the test dataset. Considering the classification by expert dermatopathologists as reference, the trained deep net showed high accuracy (96.5%), sensitivity (95.7%), specificity (97.7%), F1 score (96.5%), and a Cohen's kappa of 0.929. Our data show that a deep learning system can be trained to recognize melanoma samples, achieving accuracies comparable to experienced dermatopathologists. Such an approach can offer a valuable aid in improving diagnostic efficiency when expert consultation is not available, as well as reducing interobserver variability. Further studies in larger data sets are necessary to verify whether the deep learning algorithm allows subclassification of different melanoma subtypes.", "As a respiratory infection, pneumonia has gained great attention from countries all over the world for its strong spreading and relatively high mortality. For pneumonia, early detection and treatment will reduce its mortality rate significantly. Currently, X-ray diagnosis is recognized as a relatively effective method. The visual analysis of a patient's X-ray chest radiograph by an experienced doctor takes about 5 to 15 minutes. When cases are concentrated, this will undoubtedly put tremendous pressure on the doctor's clinical diagnosis. Therefore, relying on the naked eye of the imaging doctor has very low efficiency. Hence, the use of artificial intelligence for clinical image diagnosis of pneumonia is a necessary thing. In addition, artificial intelligence recognition is very fast, and the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved better performance than human beings in terms of image identification. Therefore, we used the dataset which has chest X-ray images for classification made available by Kaggle with a total of 5216 train and 624 test images, with 2 classes as normal and pneumonia. We performed studies using five mainstream network algorithms to classify these diseases in the dataset and compared the results, from which we improved MobileNet's network structure and achieved a higher accuracy rate than other methods. Furthermore, the improved MobileNet's network could also extend to other areas for application.", "In membrane separation technologies, membrane modules are used to separate chemical components. In membrane technology, understanding the behavior of fluids inside membrane module is challenging, and numerical methods are possible by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). On the other hand, the optimization of membrane technology via CFD needs time and computational costs. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and CFD together can model a chemical process, including membrane technology and phase separation. This process can learn the process by learning the neural networks, and point by point learning of CFD mesh elements (computing nodes), and the fuzzy logic system can predict this process. In the current study, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model and different parameters of ANFIS for learning a process based on membrane technology was used. The purpose behind using this model is to see how different tuning parameters of the ANFIS model can be used for increasing the exactness of the AI model and prediction of the membrane technology. These parameters were changed in this study, and the accuracy of the prediction was investigated. The results indicated that with low number of inputs, poor regression was obtained, less than 0.32 (R-value), but by increasing the number of inputs, the AI algorithm led to an increase in the prediction capability of the model. When the number of inputs increased to 4, the R-value was increased to 0.99, showing the high accuracy of model as well as its high capability in prediction of membrane process. The AI results were in good agreement with the CFD results. AI results were achieved in a limited time and with low computational costs. In terms of the categorization of CFD data-set, the AI framework plays a critical role in storing data in short memory, and the recovery mechanism can be very easy for users. Furthermore, the results were compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSOFIS), and Genetic Algorithm (GAFIS). The time for prediction and learning were compared to study the capability of the methods in prediction and their accuracy.", "The agriculture sector faces crop losses every year due to diseases around the globe, which adversely affect food productivity and quality. Detecting and identifying plant diseases at an early stage is still a challenge for farmers, particularly in developing countries. Widespread use of mobile computing devices and the advancements in artificial intelligence have created opportunities for developing technologies to assist farmers in plant disease detection and treatment. To this end, deep learning has been widely used for disease detection in plants with highly favorable outcomes. In this paper, we propose an efficient convolutional neural network-based disease detection framework in plum under true field conditions for resource-constrained devices. As opposed to the publicly available datasets, images used in this study were collected in the field by considering important parameters of image-capturing devices such as angle, scale, orientation, and environmental conditions. Furthermore, extensive data augmentation was used to expand the dataset and make it more challenging to enable robust training. Investigations of recent architectures revealed that transfer learning of scale-sensitive models like Inception yield results much better with such challenging datasets with extensive data augmentation. Through parameter quantization, we optimized the Inception-v3 model for deployment on resource-constrained devices. The optimized model successfully classified healthy and diseased fruits and leaves with more than 92% accuracy on mobile devices.", "Verbal working memory (WM) has been assumed to involve 2 different systems of maintenance, a phonological loop and a central attentional system. Though the capacity estimate for letters of each of these systems is about 4, the maximum number of letters that individuals are able to immediately recall, a measure known as simple span, is not about 8 but 6. We tested the hypothesis that, unaware of the dual structure of their verbal WM, individuals underuse it by trying to verbally rehearse too many items. In order to maximize the use of verbal WM, we designed a new procedure called the maxispan procedure. When performing an immediate serial recall task, participants were invited to cumulatively rehearse a limited number of letters, and to keep rehearsing these letters until the end of the presentation of the list in such a way that the following letters can no longer enter the phonological loop and must be stored in the attentional system. As we expected, in 3 successive experiments, the maxispan procedure resulted in a dramatic increase in spans compared with the traditional simple span procedure, with spans approaching 8 when the to-be-rehearsed letters were presented auditorily and the following letters visually. These results indicate that simple spans, which have been used for more than a century in intelligence tests and are assumed to measure the capacity of short-term memory (STM), actually reflect the complex interplay between different structures and cognitive processes.

So far, most of the mature dialogue systems are task-oriented based, while non-task-oriented dialogue systems still have a lot of room for improvement. We propose a data-driven non-task-oriented dialogue generator \"CERG\" based on neural networks. This model has the emotion recognition capability and can generate corresponding responses. The data set we adopt comes from the NTCIR-14 STC-3 CECG subtask, which contains more than 1.7 million Chinese Weibo post-response pairs and 6 emotion categories. We try to concatenate the post and the response with the emotion, then mask the response part of the input text character by character to emulate the encoder-decoder framework. We use the improved transformer blocks as the core to build the model and add regularization methods to alleviate the problems of overcorrection and exposure bias. We introduce the retrieval method to the inference process to improve the semantic relevance of generated responses. The results of the manual evaluation show that our proposed model can make different responses to different emotions to improve the human-computer interaction experience. This model can be applied to lots of domains, such as automatic reply robots of social application.", "Previous two generations of esophageal capsule did not show adequate detection rates for Barrett's esophagus (BE). We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a novel third generation capsule with an improved frame rate of 35 frames per second for the detection of BE in a pilot study.\nThis was a blinded prospective pilot study conducted at a tertiary medical center. Patients with known BE (at least C0M\u00a0>\u00a01) who presented for endoscopic surveillance (May to October 2017) were included. All patients underwent novel esophageal capsule (PillCam\u2122 UGI; Medtronic) ingestion using the simplified ingestion protocol followed by standard high-definition upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD]). Capsule endoscopy findings were interpreted by examiners blinded to endoscopy results and compared with endoscopic findings (gold standard). Following completion of both tests, a subjective questionnaire was provided to all patients regarding their experience.\nTwenty patients (95%males, mean age 66.3 [\u00b17.9] years) with BE undergoing surveillance EGD were eligible. The mean BE length was 3.5 (\u00b12.7) cm. Novel esophageal capsule detected BE in 75% patients when images were compared with endoscopy. Novel capsule detected BE in 82% patients when the BE length was \u22652\u00a0cm. The mean esophageal transit time was 0.59\u00a0s. On a subjective questionnaire, all 20 patients reported novel capsule as being more convenient compared with EGD.\nIn this pilot, single-center study, novel esophageal capsule was shown to be not ready for population screening of BE. Studies integrating artificial intelligence into improved quality novel esophageal capsule should be performed for BE screening.", "Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract pathology is common worldwide. With recent advancements in robotics, innovative diagnostic and treatment devices have been developed and several translational attempts made. This review paper aims to provide a highly pictorial critical review of robotic gastroscopes, so that clinicians and researchers can obtain a swift and comprehensive overview of key technologies and challenges. Therefore, the paper presents robotic gastroscopes, either commercial or at a progressed technology readiness level. Among them, we show tethered and wireless gastroscopes, as well as devices aimed for UGI surgery. The technological features of these instruments, as well as their clinical adoption and performance, are described and compared. Although the existing endoscopic devices have thus far provided substantial improvements in the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment, there are certain aspects that represent unwavering predicaments of the current gastroenterology practice. A detailed list includes difficulties and risks, such as transmission of communicable diseases (e.g., COVID-19) due to the doctor-patient proximity, unchanged learning curves, variable detection rates, procedure-related adverse events, endoscopists' and nurses' burnouts, limited human and/or material resources, and patients' preferences to choose non-invasive options that further interfere with the successful implementation and adoption of routine screening. The combination of robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as remote telehealth endoscopy services, are also discussed, as viable solutions to improve existing platforms for diagnosis and treatment are emerging.", "Most individuals with advanced dementia lose the ability to communicate with the outside world through speech. This limits their ability to participate in social activities crucial to their well-being and quality of life. However, there is mounting evidence that individuals with advanced dementia can still communicate non-verbally and benefit greatly from these interactions. A major problem in facilitating the advancement of this research is of a practical and methodical nature: assessing the success of treatment is currently done by humans, prone to subjective bias and inconsistency, and it involves laborious and time consuming effort. The present work is the first attempt at exploring if automatic (artificial intelligence based) quantification of the degree of patient engagement in Adaptive Interaction sessions, a highly promising intervention developed to improve the quality of life of nonverbal individuals with advanced dementia. Hence we describe a framework which uses computer vision and machine learning as a potential first step towards answering this question. Using a real-world data set of videos of therapeutic sessions, not acquired specifically for the purposes of the present work, we demonstrate highly promising results.", "Errors inherent in self-reported measures of energy intake (EI) are substantial and well documented, but correlates of misreporting remain unclear. Therefore, potential predictors of misreporting were examined. In Study One, fifty-nine individuals (BMI = 26\u00b71 (sd 3\u00b78) kg/m2, age = 42\u00b77 (sd 13\u00b76) years, females = 29) completed a 14-d stay in a residential feeding behaviour suite where eating behaviour was continuously monitored. In Study Two, 182 individuals (BMI = 25\u00b77 (sd 3\u00b79) kg/m2, age = 42\u00b74 (sd 12\u00b72) years, females = 96) completed two consecutive days in a residential feeding suite and five consecutive days at home. Misreporting was directly quantified by comparing covertly measured laboratory weighed intakes (LWI) with self-reported EI (weighed dietary record (WDR), 24-h recall, 7-d diet history, FFQ). Personal (age, sex and %body fat) and psychological traits (personality, social desirability, body image, intelligence quotient and eating behaviour) were used as predictors of misreporting. In Study One, those with lower psychoticism (P = 0\u00b7009), openness to experience (P = 0\u00b7006) and higher agreeableness (P = 0\u00b7038) reduced EI on days participants knew EI was being measured to a greater extent than on covert days. Isolated associations existed between personality traits (psychoticism and openness to experience), eating behaviour (emotional eating) and differences between the LWI and self-reported EI, but these were inconsistent between dietary assessment techniques and typically became non-significant after accounting for multiplicity of comparisons. In Study Two, sex was associated with differences between LWI and the WDR (P = 0\u00b7009), 24-h recall (P = 0\u00b7002) and diet history (P = 0\u00b7050) in the laboratory, but not home environment. Personal and psychological correlates of misreporting identified displayed no clear pattern across studies or dietary assessment techniques and had little utility in predicting misreporting.", "We consider centralized networks composed of multiple satellites arranged around a few dominating super-egoistic centers. These so-called empires are organized using a divide and rule framework enforcing strong center-satellite interactions while keeping the pairwise interactions between the satellites sufficiently weak. We present a stochastic stability analysis, in which we consider these dynamical systems as stable if the centers have sufficient resources while the satellites have no value. Our model is based on a Hopfield type network that proved its significance in the field of artificial intelligence. Using this model, it is shown that the divide and rule framework provides important advantages: it allows for completely controlling the dynamics in a straight-forward way by adjusting center-satellite interactions. Moreover, it is shown that such empires should only have a single ruling center to provide sufficient stability. To survive, empires should have switching mechanisms implementing adequate behavior models by choosing appropriate local attractors in order to correctly respond to internal and external challenges. By an analogy with Bose-Einstein condensation, we show that if the noise correlations are negative for each pair of nodes, then the most stable structure with respect to noise is a globally connected network. For social systems, we show that controllability by their centers is only possible if the centers evolve slowly. Except for short periods when the state approaches a certain stable state, the development of such structures is very slow and negatively correlated with the size of the system's structure. Hence, increasing size eventually ends up in the \"control trap.\"", "The coronavirus crisis has seen an unprecedented response from India and the world. If the viral outbreak has exposed gross inadequacies in the healthcare systems of nations both rich and poor, it has stirred a digital healthcare revolution that has been building since the past decade. We have seen how this new era of digital health evolved over the years since healthcare started getting increasingly unaffordable in the western countries forcing a relook in their strategies to explosion of digital innovations in mobile telephony and applications, internet, wearable devices, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data and genomics. The single biggest trigger for the digital shift has indeed been the COVID-19 pandemic this year, more so in India with astonishing response from the private enterprise and the proactive push from the government so evident. However, the full potential of this digital revolution cannot be realized as long as core structural reforms in public healthcare do not take place along with significant boost in digital infrastructure. The way digital technologies have helped facilitate strategy and response to the global pandemic and with predictions of more zoonotic outbreaks impending in the coming years, it has become imperative for the world to increasingly adopt and integrate digital innovations to make healthcare more accessible, interconnected and affordable.", "Operative video has great potential to enable instant replays of critical surgical decisions for training and quality review. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown early promise as a method of enabling efficient video review, analysis, and segmentation. Despite the progress with AI analysis of surgical videos, more work needs to be done to improve the accuracy and efficiency of AI-driven video analysis. At a recent consensus conference held on July 10-11, 2020, 8 research teams shared their work using AI for surgical video analysis. Four of the teams showcased the utility of wearable technology in providing objective surgical metrics. Data from these technologies were shown to pinpoint important cognitive and motor actions during operative tasks and procedures. The results support the utility of wearable technology to facilitate efficient and accurate video analysis and segmentation.", "Machine learning has been used for distinct purposes in the science field but no applications on illegal drug have been done before. This study proposes a new web-based system for cocaine classification, profiling relations and comparison, that is capable of producing meaningful output based on a large amount of chemical profiling's data. In particular, the Profiling Relations In Drug trafficking in Europe (PRIDE) system, offers several advantages to intelligence actions across Europe. Thus, it provides a standardized, broad methodology which uses machine learning algorithms to classify and compare drug profiles, highlight how similar drug samples are, and how probable it is that they share a common origin, batch, or preparation process. We evaluated the proposed algorithms using precision and recall metrics and analyzed the quality of predictions performed by the algorithms, with respect to our gold standard. In our experiments, we reached a value of 88% for F0.5-measure, 91% for precision, and 78% for recall, confirming our main hypothesis: machine learning can learn and be applied to have an automatic classification of cocaine profiles.", "With the increasing incidences and mortality of digestive system tumor diseases in China, ways to use clinical experience data in Chinese electronic medical records (CEMRs) to determine potentially effective relationships between diagnosis and treatment have become a priority. As an important part of artificial intelligence, a knowledge graph is a powerful tool for information processing and knowledge organization that provides an ideal means to solve this problem.\nThis study aimed to construct a semantic-driven digestive system tumor knowledge graph (DSTKG) to represent the knowledge in CEMRs with fine granularity and semantics.\nThis paper focuses on the knowledge graph schema and semantic relationships that were the main challenges for constructing a Chinese tumor knowledge graph. The DSTKG was developed through a multistep procedure. As an initial step, a complete DSTKG construction framework based on CEMRs was proposed. Then, this research built a knowledge graph schema containing 7 classes and 16 kinds of semantic relationships and accomplished the DSTKG by knowledge extraction, named entity linking, and drawing the knowledge graph. Finally, the quality of the DSTKG was evaluated from 3 aspects: data layer, schema layer, and application layer.\nExperts agreed that the DSTKG was good overall (mean score 4.20). Especially for the aspects of \"rationality of schema structure,\" \"scalability,\" and \"readability of results,\" the DSTKG performed well, with scores of 4.72, 4.67, and 4.69, respectively, which were much higher than the average. However, the small amount of data in the DSTKG negatively affected its \"practicability\" score. Compared with other Chinese tumor knowledge graphs, the DSTKG can represent more granular entities, properties, and semantic relationships. In addition, the DSTKG was flexible, allowing personalized customization to meet the designer's focus on specific interests in the digestive system tumor.\nWe constructed a granular semantic DSTKG. It could provide guidance for the construction of a tumor knowledge graph and provide a preliminary step for the intelligent application of knowledge graphs based on CEMRs. Additional data sources and stronger research on assertion classification are needed to gain insight into the DSTKG's potential.", "For the past 40 years, the methodology for stress echocardiography (SE) has remained basically unchanged. It is based on two-dimensional, black and white imaging, and is used to detect regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). In the last five years much has changed and RWMA is not enough on its own to stratify patient risk and dictate therapy. Patients arriving at SE labs often have comorbidities and are undergoing full anti-ischemic therapy. The SE positivity rate based on RWMA fell from 70% in the eighties to 10% in the last decade. The understanding of CAD pathophysiology has shifted from a regional hydraulic disease to a systemic biologic disease. The conventional view of CAD encouraged the use of coronary anatomic imaging for diagnosis and the oculo-stenotic reflex for the deployment of therapy. This has led to a clinical oversimplification that ignores the lessons of pathophysiology and epidemiology, and in fact, CAD is not synonymous with ischemic heart disease. Patients with CAD may also have other vulnerabilities such as coronary plaque (step A of ABCDE-SE), alveolar-capillary membrane and pulmonary congestion (step B), preload and contractile reserve (step C), coronary microcirculation (step D) and cardiac autonomic balance (step E). The SE methodology based on two-dimensional echocardiography is now integrated with lung ultrasound (step B for B-lines), volumetric echocardiography (step C), color- and pulsed-wave Doppler (step D) and non-imaging electrocardiogram-based heart rate assessment (step E). In addition, qualitative assessment based on the naked eye has now become more quantitative, has been improved by contrast and based on cardiac strain and artificial intelligence. ABCDE-SE is now ready for large scale multicenter testing in the SE2030 study.", "Big data has transformed into a trend phrase in healthcare and neurosurgery, becoming a pervasive and inescapable phrase in everyday life. The upsurge in big data applications is a direct consequence of the drastic boom in information technology as well as the growing number of internet-connected devices called the Internet of Things in healthcare. Compared with business, marketing, and other sectors, healthcare applications are lagging due to a lack of technical knowledge among healthcare workers, technological limitations in acquiring and analyzing the data, and improper governance of healthcare big data. Despite these limitations, the medical literature is flooded with big data-related articles, and most of these are filled with abstruse terminologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, artificial neural network, and algorithm. Many of the recent articles are restricted to neurosurgical registries, creating a false impression that big data is synonymous with registries. Others advocate that the utilization of big data will be the panacea to all healthcare problems and research in the future. Without a proper understanding of these principles, it becomes easy to get lost without the ability to differentiate hype from reality. To that end, the authors give a brief narrative of big data analysis in neurosurgery and review its applications, limitations, and the challenges it presents for neurosurgeons and healthcare professionals naive to this field. Awareness of these basic concepts will allow neurosurgeons to understand the literature regarding big data, enabling them to make better decisions and deliver personalized care.", "The COVID-19 diagnostic approach is mainly divided into two broad categories, a laboratory-based and chest radiography approach. The last few months have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of studies use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to diagnose COVID-19 with chest computed tomography (CT). In this study, we review the diagnosis of COVID-19 by using chest CT toward AI. We searched ArXiv, MedRxiv, and Google Scholar using the terms \"deep learning\", \"neural networks\", \"COVID-19\", and \"chest CT\". At the time of writing (August 24, 2020), there have been nearly 100 studies and 30 studies among them were selected for this review. We categorized the studies based on the classification tasks: COVID-19/normal, COVID-19/non-COVID-19, COVID-19/non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and severity. The sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, area under the curve, and F1 score results were reported as high as 100%, 100%, 99.62, 99.87%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. However, the presented results should be carefully compared due to the different degrees of difficulty of different classification tasks.", "Modern technology development created significant innovations in delivery of healthcare. Artificial intelligence as \"a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behaviour in computers\" when applied in health care resulted in intelligent support to decision-making, optimised business processes, increased quality, monitoring and delivering of personalised treatment plans and many other applications. Even though the benefits are clear and numerous, there are still open issues in creating automation of healthcare processes, ensuring data protection and integrity, reduction of medical waste etc. However, due to rapid development of AI techniques, more advances and improvements are still expected.", "Rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining grounds in medicine. Its huge impact and inevitable necessity are also reflected in cardiovascular imaging. Although AI would probably never replace doctors, it can significantly support and improve their productivity and diagnostic performance. Many algorithms have already proven useful at all stages of the cardiac imaging chain. Their crucial practical applications include classification, automatic quantification, notification, diagnosis, and risk prediction. Consequently, more reproducible and repeatable studies are obtained, and personalized reports may be available to any patient. Utilization of AI also increases patient safety and decreases healthcare costs. Furthermore, AI is particularly useful for beginners in the field of cardiac imaging as it provides anatomic guidance and interpretation of complex imaging results. In contrast, lack of interpretability and explainability in AI carries a risk of harmful recommendations. This review was aimed at summarizing AI principles, essential execution requirements, and challenges as well as its recent applications in cardiovascular imaging.", "Introduction: Emotional issues are often reported among individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and some studies have suggested that deficits in ability to quickly encode emotions may contribute to these problems. However, poor performance on emotion encoding tasks could also be explained by a more general cognitive deficit (Full Scale IQ [FSIQ]), rather than a specific deficit in emotional processing. Since individuals with DM1 are known to exhibit difficulties in general cognitive abilities, it is important to account for FSIQ when evaluating emotion encoding. The aim of this study was to compare emotion encoding abilities between individuals with and without DM1, while adjusting for the impact of general cognitive abilities (FSIQ). Methods: The sample included 35 individuals with adult-onset DM1 and 54 unaffected adults who completed assessments of emotion encoding abilities (Ekman faces test) and general cognitive abilities (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV). Performance on the emotion encoding task was operationalized as proportion correct and response time. Group differences in proportion correct were evaluated with generalized linear regression, while linear regression models were used to determine the effect of group on response time. Models were adjusted for age, sex, and FSIQ. The false discovery rate (FDR) was applied to control false positives due to multiple comparisons (pfdr ). Results: No significant group differences were observed for emotion encoding abilities (all pfdr > 0.13). FSIQ was significantly associated with proportion correct and with response time (all pfdr < 0.05). Conclusions: Emotion encoding appears intact in individuals with DM1 and variation in the ability to encode facial expressions was associated with FSIQ. Further research is required to address the relationship between general cognitive abilities and emotion encoding abilities among DM1 patients.", "The responses of visual neurons, as well as visual perception phenomena in general, are highly nonlinear functions of the visual input, while most vision models are grounded on the notion of a linear receptive field (RF). The linear RF has a number of inherent problems: it changes with the input, it presupposes a set of basis functions for the visual system, and it conflicts with recent studies on dendritic computations. Here we propose to model the RF in a nonlinear manner, introducing the intrinsically nonlinear receptive field (INRF). Apart from being more physiologically plausible and embodying the efficient representation principle, the INRF has a key property of wide-ranging implications: for several vision science phenomena where a linear RF must vary with the input in order to predict responses, the INRF can remain constant under different stimuli. We also prove that Artificial Neural Networks with INRF modules instead of linear filters have a remarkably improved performance and better emulate basic human perception. Our results suggest a change of paradigm for vision science as well as for artificial intelligence.", "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent form of oral cancer. Very few researches have been carried out for the automatic diagnosis of OSCC using artificial intelligence techniques. Though biopsy is the ultimate test for cancer diagnosis, analyzing a biopsy report is a very much challenging task. To develop computer-assisted software that will diagnose cancerous cells automatically is very important and also a major need of the hour.\nTo identify OSCC based on morphological and textural features of hand-cropped cell nuclei by traditional machine learning methods.\nIn this study, a structure for semi-automated detection and classification of oral cancer from microscopic biopsy images of OSCC, using clinically significant and biologically interpretable morphological and textural features, are examined and proposed. Forty biopsy slides were used for the study from which a total of 452 hand-cropped cell nuclei has been considered for morphological and textural feature extraction and further analysis. After making a comparative analysis of commonly used methods in the segmentation technique, a combined technique is proposed. Our proposed methodology achieves the best segmentation of the nuclei. Henceforth the features extracted were fed into five classifiers, support vector machine, logistic regression, linear discriminant, k-nearest neighbors and decision tree classifier. Classifiers were also analyzed by training time. Another contribution of the study is a large indigenous cell level dataset of OSCC biopsy images.\nWe achieved 99.78% accuracy applying decision tree classifier in classifying OSCC using morphological and textural features.\nIt is found that both morphological and textural features play a very important role in OSCC diagnosis. It is hoped that this type of framework will help the clinicians/pathologists in OSCC diagnosis.", "Musculoskeletal imaging is mainly based on the subjective and qualitative analysis of imaging examinations. However, integration of quantitative assessment of imaging data could increase the value of imaging in both research and clinical practice. Some imaging modalities, such as perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI, or T2 mapping, are intrinsically quantitative. But conventional morphological imaging can also be analyzed through the quantification of various parameters. The quantitative data retrieved from imaging examinations can serve as biomarkers and be used to support diagnosis, determine patient prognosis, or monitor therapy.We focus on the value, or clinical utility, of quantitative imaging in the musculoskeletal field. There is currently a trend to move from volume- to value-based payments. This review contains definitions and examines the role that quantitative imaging may play in the implementation of value-based health care. The influence of artificial intelligence on the value of quantitative musculoskeletal imaging is also discussed.", "Assessment and management of children with growth failure has improved greatly over recent years. However, there remains a strong potential for further improvements by using novel digital techniques. A panel of experts discussed developments in digitalization of a number of important tools used by pediatric endocrinologists at the third 360\u00b0 European Meeting on Growth and Endocrine Disorders, funded by Merck KGaA, Germany, and this review is based on those discussions. It was reported that electronic monitoring and new algorithms have been devised that are providing more sensitive referral for short stature. In addition, computer programs have improved ways in which diagnoses are coded for use by various groups including healthcare providers and government health systems. Innovative cranial imaging techniques have been devised that are considered safer than using gadolinium contrast agents and are also more sensitive and accurate. Deep-learning neural networks are changing the way that bone age and bone health are assessed, which are more objective than standard methodologies. Models for prediction of growth response to growth hormone (GH) treatment are being improved by applying novel artificial intelligence methods that can identify non-linear and linear factors that relate to response, providing more accurate predictions. Determination and interpretation of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels are becoming more standardized and consistent, for evaluation across different patient groups, and computer-learning models indicate that baseline IGF-1 standard deviation score is among the most important indicators of GH therapy response. While physicians involved in child growth and treatment of disorders resulting in growth failure need to be aware of, and keep abreast of, these latest developments, treatment decisions and management should continue to be based on clinical decisions. New digital technologies and advancements in the field should be aimed at improving clinical decisions, making greater standardization of assessment and facilitating patient-centered approaches.", "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality rates. Early detection and treatment are critical to improving outcomes. Our primary objective was to develop artificial intelligence capable of predicting sepsis earlier using a minimal set of streaming physiological data in real time.\nA total of 29,552 adult patients were admitted to the intensive care unit across five regional hospitals in Memphis, Tenn, over 18 months from January 2017 to July 2018. From these, 5,958 patients were selected after filtering for continuous (minute-by-minute) physiological data availability. A total of 617 (10.4%) patients were identified as sepsis cases, using the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) criteria. Physiomarkers, a set of signal processing features, were derived from five physiological data streams including heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), captured every minute from the bedside monitors. A support vector machine classifier was used for classification. The model accurately predicted sepsis up to a mean and 95% confidence interval of 17.4\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.22\u200ah before sepsis onset, with an average test accuracy of 83.0% (average sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.757, 0.902, and 0.781, respectively).\nThis study demonstrates that salient physiomarkers derived from continuous bedside monitoring are temporally and differentially expressed in septic patients. Using this information, minimalistic artificial intelligence models can be developed to predict sepsis earlier in critically ill patients.", "Cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) aberrations have been reported as a biomarker of response to immunotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Herein, we characterize CDK12-mutated mCRPC, presenting clinical, genomic, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) data.\nPatients with mCRPC consented to the molecular analyses of diagnostic and mCRPC biopsies. Genomic analyses involved targeted next-generation (MiSeq; Illumina) and exome sequencing (NovaSeq; Illumina). TILs were assessed by validated immunocytochemistry coupled with deep learning-based artificial intelligence analyses including multiplex immunofluorescence assays for CD4, CD8, and FOXP3 evaluating TIL subsets. The control group comprised a randomly selected mCRPC cohort with sequencing and clinical data available.\nBiopsies from 913 patients underwent targeted sequencing between February 2015 and October 2019. Forty-three patients (4.7%) had tumors with CDK12 alterations. CDK12-altered cancers had distinctive features, with some revealing high chromosomal break numbers in exome sequencing. Biallelic CDK12-aberrant mCRPCs had shorter overall survival from diagnosis than controls [5.1 years (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0-7.9) vs. 6.4 years (95% CI, 5.7-7.8); hazard ratio (HR), 1.65 (95% CI, 1.07-2.53); P = 0.02]. Median intratumoral CD3+ cell density was higher in CDK12 cancers, although this was not statistically significant (203.7 vs. 86.7 cells/mm2; P = 0.07). This infiltrate primarily comprised of CD4+FOXP3- cells (50.5 vs. 6.2 cells/mm2; P < 0.0001), where high counts tended to be associated with worse survival from diagnosis (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.95-2.84; P = 0.077) in the overall population.\nCDK12-altered mCRPCs have worse prognosis, with these tumors surprisingly being primarily enriched for CD4+FOXP3- cells that seem to associate with worse outcome and may be immunosuppressive.See related commentary by Lotan and Antonarakis, p. 380.", "Diagnostic delay in rare disease (RD) is common, occasionally lasting up to more than 20 years. In attempting to reduce it, diagnostic support tools have been studied extensively. However, social platforms have not yet been used for systematic diagnostic support. This paper illustrates the development and prototypic application of a social network using scientifically developed questions to match individuals without a diagnosis.\nThe study aimed to outline, create, and evaluate a prototype tool (a social network platform named RarePairs), helping patients with undiagnosed RDs to find individuals with similar symptoms. The prototype includes a matching algorithm, bringing together individuals with similar disease burden in the lead-up to diagnosis.\nWe divided our project into 4 phases. In phase 1, we used known data and findings in the literature to understand and specify the context of use. In phase 2, we specified the user requirements. In phase 3, we designed a prototype based on the results of phases 1 and 2, as well as incorporating a state-of-the-art questionnaire with 53 items for recognizing an RD. Lastly, we evaluated this prototype with a data set of 973 questionnaires from individuals suffering from different RDs using 24 distance calculating methods.\nBased on a step-by-step construction process, the digital patient platform prototype, RarePairs, was developed. In order to match individuals with similar experiences, it uses answer patterns generated by a specifically designed questionnaire (Q53). A total of 973 questionnaires answered by patients with RDs were used to construct and test an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm like the k-nearest neighbor search. With this, we found matches for every single one of the 973 records. The cross-validation of those matches showed that the algorithm outperforms random matching significantly. Statistically, for every data set the algorithm found at least one other record (match) with the same diagnosis.\nDiagnostic delay is torturous for patients without a diagnosis. Shortening the delay is important for both doctors and patients. Diagnostic support using AI can be promoted differently. The prototype of the social media platform RarePairs might be a low-threshold patient platform, and proved suitable to match and connect different individuals with comparable symptoms. This exchange promoted through RarePairs might be used to speed up the diagnostic process. Further studies include its evaluation in a prospective setting and implementation of RarePairs as a mobile phone app.", "As the COVID-19 epidemic increases in severity, the burden of quarantine stations outside emergency departments (EDs) at hospitals is increasing daily. To address the high screening workload at quarantine stations, all staff members with medical licenses are required to work shifts in these stations. Therefore, it is necessary to simplify the workflow and decision-making process for physicians and surgeons from all subspecialties.\nThe aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the National Cheng Kung University Hospital artificial intelligence (AI) trilogy of diversion to a smart quarantine station, AI-assisted image interpretation, and a built-in clinical decision-making algorithm improves medical care and reduces quarantine processing times.\nThis observational study on the emerging COVID-19 pandemic included 643 patients. An \"AI trilogy\" of diversion to a smart quarantine station, AI-assisted image interpretation, and a built-in clinical decision-making algorithm on a tablet computer was applied to shorten the quarantine survey process and reduce processing time during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe use of the AI trilogy facilitated the processing of suspected cases of COVID-19 with or without symptoms; also, travel, occupation, contact, and clustering histories were obtained with the tablet computer device. A separate AI-mode function that could quickly recognize pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-rays was merged into the smart clinical assisting system (SCAS), and this model was subsequently trained with COVID-19 pneumonia cases from the GitHub open source data set. The detection rates for posteroanterior and anteroposterior chest x-rays were 55/59 (93%) and 5/11 (45%), respectively. The SCAS algorithm was continuously adjusted based on updates to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control public safety guidelines for faster clinical decision making. Our ex vivo study demonstrated the efficiency of disinfecting the tablet computer surface by wiping it twice with 75% alcohol sanitizer. To further analyze the impact of the AI application in the quarantine station, we subdivided the station group into groups with or without AI. Compared with the conventional ED (n=281), the survey time at the quarantine station (n=1520) was significantly shortened; the median survey time at the ED was 153 minutes (95% CI 108.5-205.0), vs 35 minutes at the quarantine station (95% CI 24-56; P<.001). Furthermore, the use of the AI application in the quarantine station reduced the survey time in the quarantine station; the median survey time without AI was 101 minutes (95% CI 40-153), vs 34 minutes (95% CI 24-53) with AI in the quarantine station (P<.001).\nThe AI trilogy improved our medical care workflow by shortening the quarantine survey process and reducing the processing time, which is especially important during an emerging infectious disease epidemic.", "The aim of the study was to evaluate neurocognitive late effects, structural alterations and associations between cognitive impairment and radiation doses as well as cerebral tissue damage after radiotherapy for sinonasal cancer. Furthermore, the aim was to report quality of life (QoL) and self-reported cognitive capacity.\nRecurrence-free patients previously treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy with a curative intent were eligible for the study. Study examinations comprised comprehensive neurocognitive testing, MRI of the brain, and self-reported outcomes.\nA total of 27 patients were included. Median age was 67\u00a0years (range 47-83). The majority of test outcomes were below normative values in any degree, and 37% of the participants had clinically significant neurocognitive impairment when compared with normative data. Correlations between absorbed doses to specific substructures of the brain and neurocognitive outcomes were present for Wechsler's Adult Intelligence Scale-digit span and Controlled Oral Word Association Test-S. Structural MRI revealed macroscopic abnormalities in three patients; infarction (n\u00a0=\u00a01), diffuse white matter intensities (n\u00a0=\u00a02) and necrosis (n\u00a0=\u00a01). In the analysis of atrophy of cerebral tissue, no correlations were present with neither radiation dose to cerebral substructures nor neurocognitive impairment. The global QoL of the cohort was 75. The most affected outcomes were 'fatigue', 'insomnia', and 'drowsiness'. A total of 59% of participants reported significantly impaired quality of sleep. Self-reported cognitive function revealed that 'memory' was the most affected cognitive domain. For the domains of 'memory' and 'language', self-reported functioning was associated with objectively measured neurocognitive outcomes.\nCerebral toxicity after radiotherapy for sinonasal cancer was substantial. Clinically significant cognitive impairment was present in more than one third of the participants, and several dose-response associations were present. Furthermore, the presence of macroscopic radiation sequelae indicated considerable impact of radiotherapy on brain tissue.", "Precision medicine aims to empower clinicians to predict the most appropriate course of action for patients with complex diseases like cancer, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and COVID-19. With a progressive interpretation of the clinical, molecular, and genomic factors at play in diseases, more effective and personalized medical treatments are anticipated for many disorders. Understanding patient's metabolomics and genetic make-up in conjunction with clinical data will significantly lead to determining predisposition, diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers and paths ultimately providing optimal and personalized care for diverse, and targeted chronic and acute diseases. In clinical settings, we need to timely model clinical and multi-omics data to find statistical patterns across millions of features to identify underlying biologic pathways, modifiable risk factors, and actionable information that support early detection and prevention of complex disorders, and development of new therapies for better patient care. It is important to calculate quantitative phenotype measurements, evaluate variants in unique genes and interpret using ACMG guidelines, find frequency of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants without disease indicators, and observe autosomal recessive carriers with a phenotype manifestation in metabolome. Next, ensuring security\u00a0to reconcile noise, we need to build and train machine-learning prognostic models to meaningfully process multisource heterogeneous data to identify high-risk rare variants and make medically relevant predictions. The goal, today, is to facilitate implementation of mainstream precision medicine to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine, and allow earlier interventions using predictive diagnostics and tailoring better-personalized treatments. We strongly recommend automated implementation of cutting-edge technologies, utilizing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for the multimodal data aggregation, multifactor examination, development of knowledgebase of clinical predictors for decision support, and best strategies for dealing with relevant ethical issues.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly a part of daily life and offers great possibilities to enrich health care. Imaging applications of AI have been mostly developed by large, well-funded companies and currently are inaccessible to the comparatively small market of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) programs. Given this absence of commercial solutions, we sought to create and test a do-it-yourself (DIY) deep learning algorithm to classify ultrasound images to enhance the quality assurance work-flow for POCUS programs.\nWe created a convolutional neural network using publicly available software tools and pre-existing convolutional neural network architecture. The convolutional neural network was subsequently trained using ultrasound images from seven ultrasound exam types: pelvis, heart, lung, abdomen, musculoskeletal, ocular, and central vascular access from 189 publicly available POCUS videos. Approximately 121,000 individual images were extracted from the videos, 80% were used for model training and 10% each for cross validation and testing. We then tested the algorithm for accuracy against a set of 160 randomly extracted ultrasound frames from ultrasound videos not previously used for training and that were performed on different ultrasound equipment. Three POCUS experts blindly categorized the 160 random images, and results were compared to the convolutional neural network algorithm. Descriptive statistics and Krippendorff alpha reliability estimates were calculated.\nThe cross validation of the convolutional neural network approached 99% for accuracy. The algorithm accurately classified 98% of the test ultrasound images. In the new POCUS program simulation phase, the algorithm accurately classified 70% of 160 new images for moderate correlation with the ground truth, \u03b1 = 0.64. The three blinded POCUS experts correctly classified 93%, 94%, and 98% of the images, respectively. There was excellent agreement among the experts with \u03b1 = 0.87. Agreement between experts and algorithm was good with \u03b1 = 0.74. The most common error was misclassifying musculoskeletal images for both the algorithm (40%) and POCUS experts (40.6%). The algorithm took 7 minutes 45 seconds to review and classify the new 160 images. The 3 expert reviewers took 27, 32, and 45 minutes to classify the images, respectively.\nOur algorithm accurately classified 98% of new images, by body scan area, related to its training pool, simulating POCUS program workflow. Performance was diminished with exam images from an unrelated image pool and ultrasound equipment, suggesting additional images and convolutional neural network training are necessary for fine tuning when using across different POCUS programs. The algorithm showed theoretical potential to improve workflow for POCUS program directors, if fully implemented. The implications of our DIY AI for POCUS are scalable and further work to maximize the collaboration between AI and POCUS programs is warranted.", "Termite mounds are fascinating because of their intriguing composition of numerous geometric shapes and materials. However, little is known about these structures, or of their functionalities. Most research has been on the basic composition of mounds compared with surrounding soils. There has been some targeted research on the thermoregulation and ventilation of the mounds of a few species of fungi-growing termites, which has generated considerable interest from human architecture. Otherwise, research on termite mounds has been scattered, with little work on their explicit properties. This review is focused on how termites design and build functional structures as nest, nursery and food storage; for thermoregulation and climatisation; as defence, shelter and refuge; as a foraging tool or building material; and for colony communication, either as in indirect communication (stigmergy) or as an information channel essential for direct communication through vibrations (biotremology). Our analysis shows that systematic research is required to study the properties of these structures such as porosity and material composition. High resolution computer tomography in combination with nonlinear dynamics and methods from computational intelligence may provide breakthroughs in unveiling the secrets of termite behaviour and their mounds. In particular, the examination of dynamic and wave propagation properties of termite-built structures in combination with a detailed signal analysis of termite activities is required to better understand the interplay between termites and their nest as superorganism. How termite structures serve as defence in the form of disguising acoustic and vibration signals from detection by predators, and what role local and global vibration synchronisation plays for building are open questions that need to be addressed to provide insights into how termites utilise materials to thrive in a world of predators and competitors.", "Ischaemic heart disease is among the most frequent causes of death. Early detection of myocardial pathologies can increase the benefit of therapy and reduce the number of lethal cases. Presence of myocardial scar is an indicator for developing ischaemic heart disease and can be detected with high diagnostic precision by magnetic resonance imaging. However, magnetic resonance imaging scanners are expensive and of limited availability. It is known that presence of myocardial scar has an impact on the well-established, reasonably low cost, and almost ubiquitously available electrocardiogram. However, this impact is non-specific and often hard\u00a0to detect by a physician. We present an artificial intelligence based approach\u00a0- namely a deep learning model\u00a0- for the prediction of myocardial scar based on an\u00a0electrocardiogram and additional clinical parameters.\u00a0The model was trained and evaluated by applying 6-fold cross-validation to a dataset of 12-lead electrocardiogram time series together with clinical parameters. The\u00a0proposed model for predicting the presence of scar tissue achieved an area under the curve score, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.89, 70.0, 84.3, and 78.0%, respectively. This promisingly high diagnostic precision of our electrocardiogram-based deep learning models for myocardial scar detection may support a novel, comprehensible screening method.", "Chatbots empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly engage in natural conversations and build relationships with users. Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet.\nThe purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations.\nWe conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model.\nOur review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper.\nAs AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles.", "Artificial intelligence has pervasively transformed many industries and is beginning to shape medical practice. New use cases are being identified in subspecialty domains of medicine and, in particular, application of artificial intelligence has found its way to the practice of allergy-immunology. Here, we summarize recent developments, emerging applications and obstacles to realizing full potential.\nArtificial/augmented intelligence and machine learning are being used to reduce dimensional complexity, understand cellular interactions and advance vaccine work in the basic sciences. In genomics, bioinformatic methods are critical for variant calling and classification. For clinical work, artificial intelligence is enabling disease detection, risk profiling and decision support. These approaches are just beginning to have impact upon the field of clinical immunology and much opportunity exists for further advancement.\nThis review highlights use of computational methods for analysis of large datasets across the spectrum of research and clinical care for patients with immunological disorders. Here, we discuss how big data methods are presently being used across the field clinical immunology.", "This study investigated knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions regarding the future of artificial intelligence (AI) for radiological diagnosis among dental specialists in central India.\nAn online survey was conducted consisting of 15 closed-ended questions using Google Forms and circulated among dental professionals in central India. The survey consisted of questions regarding participants' recognition of and attitudes toward AI, their opinions on directions of AI development, and their perceptions regarding the future of AI in oral radiology.\nOf the 250 participating dentists, 68% were already familiar with the concept of AI, 69% agreed that they expect to use AI for making dental diagnoses, 51% agreed that the major function of AI would be the interpretation of complicated radiographic scans, and 63% agreed that AI would have a future in India.\nThis study concluded that dental specialists were well aware of the concept of AI, that AI programs could be used as an adjunctive tool by dentists to increasing their diagnostic precision when interpreting radiographs, and that AI has a promising role in radiological diagnosis.", "Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been employed to predict construction and demolition (C&D) waste generation. However, most studies have used machine learning models with continuous data input variables, applying algorithms, such as artificial neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, support vector machines, linear regression analysis, decision trees, and genetic algorithms. Therefore, machine learning algorithms may not perform as well when applied to categorical data. This article uses machine learning algorithms to predict C&D waste generation from a dataset, as a way to improve the accuracy of waste management in C&D facilities. These datasets include categorical (e.g., region, building structure, building use, wall material, and roofing material), and continuous data (particularly, gloss floor area), and a random forest (RF) algorithm was used. Results indicate that RF is an adequate machine learning algorithm for a small dataset consisting of categorical data, and even with a small dataset, an adequate prediction model can be developed. Despite the small dataset, the predictive performance according to the demolition waste (DW) type was R (Pearson's correlation coefficient) = 0.691-0.871, R2 (coefficient of determination) = 0.554-0.800, showing stable prediction performance. High prediction performance was observed using three (for mortar), five (for other DW types), or six (for concrete) input variables. This study is significant because the proposed RF model can predict DW generation using a small amount of data. Additionally, it demonstrates the possibility of applying AI to multi-purpose DW management.", "Previous research documented positive associations between cognitively stimulating work and levels of cognitive performance, while longitudinal associations are less clear. We used 20-year longitudinal data from the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adult Development and Aging (ILSE) to examine the role of perceived work environment (autonomy, innovation, social integration, and stress) and work activities derived from an occupational database (related to information, to people, and manual activities) for trajectories of cognitive abilities (processing speed, fluid and crystallized intelligence). We used data from 374 participants in the ILSE midlife cohort (born 1950-52) who were working at baseline and had valid observations on work characteristics and control variables including education, gender, region (former East vs. West Germany), and personal income (mean age at baseline = 44 years, SD = 1, 44% women). Cognitively stimulating perceived work environments (higher levels of autonomy and innovation), higher levels of work activities related to information and people, and lower levels of manual activity at baseline were related to higher initial levels of cognitive ability. Higher work stress was related to higher baseline fluid ability. These associations were largely not independent of control variables. Higher social integration at work was related to less steep increase in crystallized intelligence and higher work stress was related to less decline in processing speed. In sum, our findings were more in line with selection rather than with enrichment effects, with the caveat that our findings rely on work variables taken at baseline. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying these findings.

Because such projects usually require both a clinician and a computational data scientist, there is a need for interdisciplinary research collaboration. However, there has been no published analysis of research collaboration networks in cardiovascular medicine using machine intelligence.\nCo-authorship network analysis was conducted on 2857 research articles published between 2009 and 2019. Bibliographic data were collected from the Web of Science, and the co-authorship networks were represented as undirected multigraphs. The network density, average degree, clustering coefficient, and number of communities were calculated, and the chronological changes were assessed. Thereafter, the leading authors were identified according to the centrality metrics. Finally, we investigated the significance of the characteristics of the co-authorship network in the largest component via a Monte Carlo simulation with the Barabasi-Albert model.\nThe co-authorship network of the entire period consisted of 13,979 nodes and 68,668 weighted edges. A time-series analysis revealed a linear correlation between the number of nodes and the number of edges (R2 = 0.9937, p < 0.001). Additionally, the number of communities was linearly correlated with the number of nodes (R2 = 0.9788, p < 0.001). The average shortest path increased by a greater degree than the logarithm of the number of nodes, indicating the scale-free structure of the network. We identified D. Berman as the most central author with regard to the degree centrality and closeness centrality. S. Neubauer was the top-ranking author with regard to the betweenness centrality. Among the 22 authors who were ranked in the top 10 for any centrality, 14 authors (63.6%) had a medical degree (medical doctor, MD). The remaining eight non-MD researchers had a PhD in computational science-related fields. The number of communities detected in the Barabasi-Albert model simulation was similar to that for the largest component of the real network (6.21 \u00b1 0.07 vs. 6, p = 0.096).\nA co-authorship network analysis revealed a structure of collaboration networks in the application of machine learning in the field of cardiovascular disease, which can be useful for planning future scientific collaboration.", "Esophageal cancer poses diagnostic, therapeutic and economic burdens in high-risk regions. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developed for diagnosis and outcome prediction using various features, including clinicopathologic, radiologic, and genetic variables, which can achieve inspiring results. One of the most recent tasks of AI is to use state-of-the-art deep learning technique to detect both early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the ways in which AI may help physicians diagnose advanced cancer and make clinical decisions based on predicted outcomes, and combine the endoscopic images to detect precancerous lesions or early cancer. Pertinent studies conducted in recent two years have surged in numbers, with large datasets and external validation from multi-centers, and have partly achieved intriguing results of expert's performance of AI in real time. Improved pre-trained computer-aided diagnosis algorithms in the future studies with larger training and external validation datasets, aiming at real-time video processing, are imperative to produce a diagnostic efficacy similar to or even superior to experienced endoscopists. Meanwhile, supervised randomized controlled trials in real clinical practice are highly essential for a solid conclusion, which meets patient-centered satisfaction. Notably, ethical and legal issues regarding the black-box nature of computer algorithms should be addressed, for both clinicians and regulators.", "A large volume of clinical care data has been generated for managing agitation in dementia. However, the valuable information in these data has not been used effectively to generate insights for improving the quality of care. Application of artificial intelligence technologies offers us enormous opportunities to reuse these data. For health data science to achieve this, this study focuses on using ontology to coding clinical knowledge for non-pharmacological treatment of agitation in a machine-readable format.\nThe resultant ontology-Dementia-Related Agitation Non-Pharmacological Treatment Ontology (DRANPTO)-was developed using a method adopted from the NeOn methodology.\nDRANPTO consisted of 569 concepts and 48 object properties. It meets the standards for biomedical ontology.\nDRANPTO is the first comprehensive semantic representation of non-pharmacological management for agitation in dementia in the long-term care setting. As a knowledge base, it will play a vital role to facilitate the development of intelligent systems for managing agitation in dementia.", "The role of women in the U.S. Military has expanded over the years. Recent policy changes allow for women to serve in all military occupations, including direct combat. Multiple studies have identified a higher risk of mental health problems with increasing levels of combat, but little is known regarding gender differences among specific combat support occupations.\nA total of 15,900 U.S. Marines (1,065 women and 14,835 men) with a deployment between 2007 and 2009 were identified from electronic military records. A standard health questionnaire was completed at the end of deployment, which queried the service member on combat exposure and mental health. Mental health problems were defined as screening positive for post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, or receiving a mental health referral. Military occupation was categorized as electrical/mechanical repair, communications/intelligence, functional support/administration, and service/supply.\nOverall, men reported more combat exposure than women. The communications/intelligence and service/supply occupations had the highest rates of combat exposure. After adjusting for combat exposure, previous diagnosis of anxiety or depression, deployment time, age, and military rank, women had higher odds than men for mental health problems in service/supply (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-2.56) and communications/intelligence occupations (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.52).\nAs women become fully integrated into the military, the study of health disparities becomes essential for medical planning purposes. Occupation-specific exposures should be considered, along with combat exposures, when determining a risk profile for adverse mental health outcomes among women and men after wartime deployment.", "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed critical failures in global public policy preparedness and response. Despite over a decade of exposure to other epidemics and pandemics, many, if not most, nation states have failed to integrate lessons learned into their pandemic preparedness and response plans. The United Kingdom's response to COVID-19 is an archetype of how the pandemic has overwhelmed traditional public health-led approaches. In this paper, we explore the UK experience and propose that pandemics constitute multivector threats meriting attention within a health intelligence framework. They employ the processes of information management used by the intelligence sector to illustrate a procedural matrix for guiding public policy during complex health security events.", "This study uses an artificial-intelligence model (recurrent neural network) for evaluating the following hypothesis: social determinants of disease association in a middle-aged or old population are different across gender and age groups. Here, the disease association indicates an association among cerebrovascular disease, hearing loss and cognitive impairment.\nData came from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2014-2016), with 6,060 participants aged 53 years or more, that is, 2,556 men, 3,504 women, 3,640 aged 70 years or less (70-), 2,420 aged 71 years or more (71+). The disease association was divided into 8 categories: 1 category for having no disease, 3 categories for having 1, 3 categories for having 2, and 1 category for having 3. Variable importance, the effect of a variable on model performance, was used for finding important social determinants of the disease association in a particular gender/age group, and evaluating the hypothesis above.\nBased on variable importance from the recurrent neural network, important social determinants of the disease association were different across gender and age groups: 1) leisure activity for men; 2) parents alive, income and economic activity for women; 3) children alive, education and family activity for 70-; and 4) brothers/sisters cohabiting, religious activity and leisure activity for 70+.\nThe findings of this study support the hypothesis, suggesting the development of new guidelines reflecting different social determinants of the disease association across gender and age groups.", "A fully labelled image dataset serves as a valuable tool for reproducible research inquiries and data processing in various computational areas, such as machine learning, computer vision, artificial intelligence and deep learning. Today's research on ageing is intended to increase awareness on research results and their applications to assist public and private sectors in selecting the right equipments for the elderlies. Many researches related to development of support devices and care equipment had been done to improve the elderly's quality of life. Indoor object detection and classification for autonomous systems require large annotated indoor images for training and testing of smart computer vision applications. This dataset entitled MYNursingHome is an image dataset for commonly used objects surrounding the elderlies in their home cares. Researchers may use this data to build up a recognition aid for the elderlies. This dataset was collected from several nursing homes in Malaysia comprises 37,500 digital images from 25 different indoor object categories including basket bin, bed, bench, cabinet and others.", "Floods are one of the worst natural disasters in the world. Colombia is a country that has been greatly affected by this disaster. For example, in the years 2010 and 2011 there was a heavy rainy season, which caused floods that affected at least two million people and there were economic losses of 6.5 million dollars, which is equivalent to 5.7% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at that time. The Magdalena River is the most important since 128 municipalities and 43 cities with a population of 6.3 million people, which is 13% of the total population of the country, are located in its basins. For this reason, the objective of the research is to design and implement a model that helps predict flooding over the Magdalena River by examining three techniques of artificial intelligence (Artificial Neuronal Networks, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System, Support Vector Machine), and thus determining which of these techniques are the most effective according to the case study. The research was limited only to these three types, due to limitations of time, data, human and financial resources, and technological infrastructure. In the end, it is concluded that the Artificial Neural Networks technique is a suitable option to implement the predictive system as long as it is not very complex and does not require high processing machine. However, to establish a model based on rules to achieve a better interpretability of the floods, the ANFIS model can be used.", "The MRI showed encephalopathy and brain atrophy of the left parietal lobe, occipital lobe and temporal lobe and decreased infiltration of the dura mater on T2-weighted imaging. But encephalopathy and brain atrophy could be improved with neurotrophic drugs and additional intelligence teaching.", "As the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, robust data describing its effect on maternal and child health (MCH) remains limited. The aim of this study was to elucidate an agenda for COVID-19 research with particular focus on its impact within MCH populations. This was achieved using the Nominal Group Technique through which researchers identified and ranked 12 research topics across various disciplines relating to MCH in the setting of COVID-19. Proposed research topics included vaccine development, genomics, and artificial intelligence among others. The proposed research priorities could serve as a template for a vigorous COVID-19 research agenda by the NIH and other national funding agencies in the US.", "Celiac disease (CD) has been on the rise in the world and a large part of it remains undiagnosed. Novel methods are required to address the gaps in prompt detection and management. Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen an exponential surge in the last decade worldwide. With the advent of big data and powerful computational ability, we now have self-driving cars and smart devices in our daily lives. Huge databases in the form of electronic medical records and images have rendered healthcare a lucrative sector where AI can prove revolutionary. It is being used extensively to overcome the barriers in clinical workflows. From the perspective of a disease, it can be deployed in multiple steps i.e. screening tools, diagnosis, developing novel therapeutic agents, proposing management plans, and defining prognostic indicators, etc. We review the areas where it may augment physicians in the delivery of better healthcare by summarizing current literature on the use of AI in healthcare using CD as a model. We further outline major barriers to its large-scale implementations and prospects from the healthcare point of view.", "Cancer treatment during pregnancy imposes a dilemma. Maternal advantage should be weighed against the potential impact of chemotherapy on child development. Recent studies in cancer survivors have shown that exposure to chemotherapeutic agents can have late adverse effects on cognitive functioning and executive functioning (EF). It is still unclear whether these late adverse effects also arise if a child is exposed to chemotherapy in utero.\nTo compare the development of executive functioning in 6\u00a0year old children prenatally exposed to chemotherapy (study group) and children born to healthy women after an uncomplicated pregnancy (control group).\nIn a multicenter cohort study, the outcome on a measure of EF was compared. Study and control children were prospectively examined by means of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), a health questionnaire and an intelligence test.\nIn total 37 study children and 37 matched controls were included. In the study group, 11 children (29.7%) were exposed to chemotherapy alone, 22 children (59.5%) were exposed to chemotherapy and surgery and 4 children (10.8%) were exposed to chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy during pregnancy. All outcome scales of the BRIEF were within normal ranges. However, a significant between-group difference in emotional control was found.\nOverall outcomes of EF were reassuring. However, children prenatally exposed to chemotherapy have weaker emotion regulation skills compared to their matched controls. The results underscore the need for long-term follow-up of these children.", "This study provides a general overview on liver and/or kidney transplantation in patients with an amino and organic acid-related disorder (AOA) with the aim to investigate patient characteristics and global outcome in Europe. This study was an initiative of the E-IMD and the AOA subnetwork of MetabERN.\nA questionnaire was sent to all clinically active European Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) members. The questionnaire focused on transplanted individuals with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), propionic acidemia (PA), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and urea-cycle disorders (UCDs).\nWe identified 280 transplanted AOA patients (liver transplantation in 20\u2009MMA, 37 PA, 47 MSUD, and 111 UCD patients, kidney or combined liver and kidney transplantation in 57\u2009MMA patients and undefined transplantation type in 8\u2009MMA patients), followed by 51 metabolic centers. At a median follow-up of 3.5\u2009years, posttransplant survival ranged between 78% and 100%, being the lowest in PA patients. Overall, the risk of mortality was highest within 14\u2009days posttransplantation. Neurological complications were mainly reported in Mut0 type MMA (n\u00a0=\u20098). Nonneurological complications occurred in MMA (n\u00a0=\u200928), PA (n\u00a0=\u20097), and UCD (n\u00a0=\u200914) patients, while it was virtually absent in MSUD patients. Only 116/280 patients were psychologically tested. In all, except MSUD patients, the intelligence quotient (IQ) remained unchanged in the majority (76/94, 81%). Forty-one percentage (9/22) of MSUD patient showed improved IQ.\nThe survival in AOA individuals receiving liver and/or kidney transplantation seems satisfactory. Evidence-based guidelines, systematic data collection, and improved cooperation between transplantation centers and European Reference Networks are indispensable to improve patient care and outcomes.", "Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a developmental learning disability that manifests as a persistent difficulty in comprehending even the most basic numeric and arithmetic concepts, despite normal intelligence and schooling opportunities. Given the predominant use of numbers in modern society, this condition can pose major challenges in the sufferer's everyday life, both in personal and professional development. Since, to date, we still lack a universally recognized and psychometrically driven definition of DD, its diagnosis has been applied to a wide variety of cognitive profiles. In this chapter, we review the behavioral and neural characterization of DD as well as the different neurocognitive and etiologic accounts of this neurodevelopmental disorder. We underline the multicomponential nature of this heterogeneous disability: different aspects of mathematical competence can be affected by both the suboptimal recruitment of general cognitive functions supporting mathematical cognition (such as attention, memory, and cognitive control) and specific deficits in mastering numeric concepts and operations. Accordingly, both intervention paradigms focused on core numeric abilities and more comprehensive protocols targeting multiple neurocognitive systems have provided evidence for effective positive outcomes.", "Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-1 (IRAK1) exhibits important roles in inflammation, infection, and autoimmune diseases; however, only a few inhibitors have been discovered. In this study, at first, a discriminatory structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was employed, but only one active compound (compound 1, IC50 = 2.25 \u03bcM) was identified. The low hit rate (2.63%) which derives from the weak discriminatory power of docking among high-scored molecules was observed in our virtual screening (VS) process for IRAK1 inhibitor. Furthermore, an artificial intelligence (AI) method, which employed a support vector machine (SVM) model, integrated information of molecular docking, pharmacophore scoring and molecular descriptors was constructed to enhance the traditional IRAK1-VS protocol. Using AI, it was found that VS of IRAK1 inhibitors excluded by over 50% of the inactive compounds, which could significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the SBVS model. Moreover, four active molecules (two of which exhibited comparative IC50 with compound 1) were accurately identified from a set of highly similar candidates. Amongst, compounds with better activity exhibited good selectivity against IRAK4. The AI assisted workflow could serve as an effective tool for enhancement of SBVS.", "Several models have been developed using conventional regression approaches to extend the criteria for liver transplantation (LT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond the Milan criteria. We aimed to develop a novel model to predict tumor recurrence after LT by adopting artificial intelligence (MoRAL-AI). This study included 563 patients who underwent LT for HCC at three large LT centers in Korea. Derivation (n = 349) and validation (n = 214) cohorts were independently established. The primary outcome was time-to-recurrence after LT. A MoRAL-AI was derived from the derivation cohort with a residual block-based deep neural network. The median follow-up duration was 74.7 months (interquartile-range, 18.5-107.4); 204 patients (36.2%) had HCC beyond the Milan criteria. The optimal model consisted of seven layers including two residual blocks. In the validation cohort, the MoRAL-AI showed significantly better discrimination function (c-index = 0.75) than the Milan (c-index = 0.64), MoRAL (c-index = 0.69), University of California San Francisco (c-index = 0.62), up-to-seven (c-index = 0.50), and Kyoto (c-index = 0.50) criteria (all p < 0.001). The largest weighted parameter in the MoRAL-AI was tumor diameter, followed by alpha-fetoprotein, age, and protein induced by vitamin K absence-II. The MoRAL-AI had better predictability of tumor recurrence after LT than conventional models. The MoRAL-AI can also evolve with further data.", "The increasing omics data present a daunting informatics challenge. DrBioRight, a natural language-oriented and artificial intelligence-driven analytics platform, enables the broad research community to perform analysis in an intuitive, efficient, transparent, and collaborative way. The emerging next-generation analytics will maximize the utility of omics data and lead to a new paradigm for biomedical research.", "To date, deep learning technologies have provided powerful decision support systems to radiologists in human medicine. The aims of this retrospective, exploratory study were to develop and describe an artificial intelligence able to screen thoracic radiographs for primary thoracic lesions in feline and canine patients. Three deep learning networks using three different pretraining strategies to predict 15 types of primary thoracic lesions were created (including tracheal collapse, left atrial enlargement, alveolar pattern, pneumothorax, and pulmonary mass). Upon completion of pretraining, the algorithms were provided with over 22\u00a0000 thoracic veterinary radiographs for specific training. All radiographs had a report created by a board-certified veterinary radiologist used as the gold standard. The performances of all three networks were compared to one another. An additional 120 radiographs were then evaluated by three types of observers: the best performing network, veterinarians, and veterinarians aided by the network. The error rates for each of the observers was calculated as an overall and for the 15 labels and were compared using a McNemar's test. The overall error rate of the network was significantly better than the overall error rate of the veterinarians or the veterinarians aided by the network (10.7%\u00a0vs 16.8%\u00a0vs17.2%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). The network's error rate was significantly better to detect cardiac enlargement and for bronchial pattern. The current network only provides help in detecting various lesion types and does not provide a diagnosis. Based on its overall very good performance, this could be used as an aid to general practitioners while waiting for the radiologist's report.", "Language is crucial for human intelligence, but what exactly is its role? We take language to be a part of a system for understanding and communicating about situations. In humans, these abilities emerge gradually from experience and depend on domain-general principles of biological neural networks: connection-based learning, distributed representation, and context-sensitive, mutual constraint satisfaction-based processing. Current artificial language processing systems rely on the same domain general principles, embodied in artificial neural networks. Indeed, recent progress in this field depends on query-based attention, which extends the ability of these systems to exploit context and has contributed to remarkable breakthroughs. Nevertheless, most current models focus exclusively on language-internal tasks, limiting their ability to perform tasks that depend on understanding situations. These systems also lack memory for the contents of prior situations outside of a fixed contextual span. We describe the organization of the brain's distributed understanding system, which includes a fast learning system that addresses the memory problem. We sketch a framework for future models of understanding drawing equally on cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence and exploiting query-based attention. We highlight relevant current directions and consider further developments needed to fully capture human-level language understanding in a computational system.", "Identification of systolic heart failure among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute dyspnea is challenging. The reasons for dyspnea are often multifactorial. A focused physical evaluation and diagnostic testing can lack sensitivity and specificity. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-enabled ECG to identify patients presenting with dyspnea who have left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD).\nWe retrospectively applied a validated artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm for the identification of LVSD (defined as LV ejection fraction \u226435%) to a cohort of patients aged \u226518 years who were evaluated in the ED at a Mayo Clinic site with dyspnea. Patients were included if they had at least one standard 12-lead ECG acquired on the date of the ED visit and an echocardiogram performed within 30 days of presentation. Patients with prior LVSD were excluded. We assessed the model performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\nA total of 1606 patients were included. Median time from ECG to echocardiogram was 1 day (Q1: 1, Q3: 2). The artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm identified LVSD with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.91) and accuracy of 85.9%. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value were 74%, 87%, 97%, and 40%, respectively. To identify an ejection fraction <50%, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.83-0.88), 86%, 63%, and 91%, respectively. NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) alone at a cutoff of >800 identified LVSD with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.76-0.84).\nThe ECG is an inexpensive, ubiquitous, painless test which can be quickly obtained in the ED. It effectively identifies LVSD in selected patients presenting to the ED with dyspnea when analyzed with artificial intelligence and outperforms NT-proBNP. Graphic Abstract: A graphic abstract is available for this article.", "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal-projecting dopaminergic neurons of the ventral forebrain, resulting in motor and cognitive deficits. Despite extensive efforts in understanding PD pathogenesis, no disease-modifying drugs exist. Recent advances in cell reprogramming technologies have facilitated the generation of patient-derived models for sporadic or familial PD and the identification of early, potentially triggering, pathological phenotypes while they provide amenable systems for drug discovery. Emerging developments highlight the enhanced potential of using more sophisticated cellular systems, including neuronal and glial co-cultures as well as three-dimensional systems that better simulate the human pathophysiology. In combination with high-throughput high-content screening technologies, these approaches open new perspectives for the identification of disease-modifying compounds. In this review, we discuss current advances and the challenges ahead in the use of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells for drug discovery in PD. We address new concepts implicating non-neuronal cells in disease pathogenesis and highlight the necessity for functional assays, such as calcium imaging and multi-electrode array recordings, to predict drug efficacy. Finally, we argue that artificial intelligence technologies will be pivotal for analysis of the large and complex data sets obtained, becoming game-changers in the process of drug discovery.", "The clinically meaningful coronary stenosis is diagnosed by trained interventional cardiologists. Whether artificial intelligence (AI) could detect coronary stenosis from CAG video is unclear.\nThe 199 consecutive patients who underwent coronary arteriography (CAG) with chest pain between December 2018 and May 2019 was enrolled. Each patient underwent CAG with multiple view resulting in total numbers of 1,838 videos. A multi-layer 3-dimensional convolution neural network (CNN) was trained as an AI to detect clinically meaningful coronary artery stenosis diagnosed by the expert interventional cardiologist, using data from 146 patients (resulted in 1,359 videos) randomly selected from the entire dataset (training dataset). This training dataset was further split into 109 patients (989 videos) for derivation and 37 patients (370 videos) for validation. The AI developed in derivation cohort was tuned in validation cohort to make final model.\nThe final model was selected as the model with best performance in validation dataset. Then, the predictive accuracy of final model was tested with the remaining 53 patients (479 videos) in test dataset. Our AI model showed a c-statistic of 0.61 in validation dataset and 0.61 in test dataset, respectively.\nAn artificial intelligence applied to CAG videos could detect clinically meaningful coronary atherosclerotic stenosis diagnosed by expert cardiologists with modest predictive value. Further studies with improved AI at larger sample size is necessary.", "The recent influx of machine learning centered investigations in the spine surgery literature has led to increased enthusiasm as to the prospect of using artificial intelligence to create clinical decision support tools, optimize postoperative outcomes, and improve technologies used in the operating room. However, the methodology underlying machine learning in spine research is often overlooked as the subject matter is quite novel and may be foreign to practicing spine surgeons. Improper application of machine learning is a significant bioethics challenge, given the potential consequences of over- or underestimating the results of such studies for clinical decision-making processes. Proper peer review of these publications requires a baseline familiarity of the language associated with machine learning, and how it differs from classical statistical analyses. This narrative review first introduces the overall field of machine learning and its role in artificial intelligence, and defines basic terminology. In addition, common modalities for applying machine learning, including classification and regression decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks are examined in the context of examples gathered from the spine literature. Lastly, the ethical challenges associated with adapting machine learning for research related to patient care, as well as future perspectives on the potential use of machine learning in spine surgery, are discussed specifically.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an exciting technology that can transform the practice of radiology. However, radiology AI is still immature with limited adopters, dominated by academic institutions, and few use cases in general practice. With scale and a focus on innovation, our practice has had the opportunity to be an early adopter of AI technology. We have gained experience identifying use cases that provide value for our patients and practice; selecting AI products and vendors; piloting vendors' AI algorithms; creating our own AI algorithms; implementing, optimizing, and maintaining these algorithms; garnering radiologist acceptance of these tools; and integrating AI into our radiologists' daily workflow. With this experience, our practice has both managed challenges and identified unexpected benefits of AI. To ensure a successful and scalable AI implementation, multiple steps are required, including preparing the data, systems, and radiologists. This article reviews our experience with AI and describes why each step is important.", "Computer Aided Diagnostics (CAD) can support medical practitioners to make critical decisions about their patients' disease conditions. Practitioners require access to the chain of reasoning behind CAD to build trust in the CAD advice and to supplement their own expertise. Yet, CAD systems might be based on black box machine learning models and high dimensional data sources such as electronic health records, magnetic resonance imaging scans, cardiotocograms, etc. These foundations make interpretation and explanation of the CAD advice very challenging. This challenge is recognised throughout the machine learning research community. eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is emerging as one of the most important research areas of recent years because it addresses the interpretability and trust concerns of critical decision makers, including those in clinical and medical practice.\nIn this work, we focus on AdaBoost, a black box model that has been widely adopted in the CAD literature. We address the challenge - to explain AdaBoost classification - with a novel algorithm that extracts simple, logical rules from AdaBoost models. Our algorithm, Adaptive-Weighted High Importance Path Snippets (Ada-WHIPS), makes use of AdaBoost's adaptive classifier weights. Using a novel formulation, Ada-WHIPS uniquely redistributes the weights among individual decision nodes of the internal decision trees of the AdaBoost model. Then, a simple heuristic search of the weighted nodes finds a single rule that dominated the model's decision. We compare the explanations generated by our novel approach with the state of the art in an experimental study. We evaluate the derived explanations with simple statistical tests of well-known quality measures, precision and coverage, and a novel measure stability that is better suited to the XAI setting.\nExperiments on 9 CAD-related data sets showed that Ada-WHIPS explanations consistently generalise better (mean coverage 15%-68%) than the state of the art while remaining competitive for specificity (mean precision 80%-99%). A very small trade-off in specificity is shown to guard against over-fitting which is a known problem in the state of the art methods.\nThe experimental results demonstrate the benefits of using our novel algorithm for explaining CAD AdaBoost classifiers widely found in the literature. Our tightly coupled, AdaBoost-specific approach outperforms model-agnostic explanation methods and should be considered by practitioners looking for an XAI solution for this class of models.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) models and optimization algorithms (OA) are broadly employed in different fields of technology and science and have recently been applied to improve different stages of plant tissue culture. The usefulness of the application of AI-OA has been demonstrated in the prediction and optimization of length and number of microshoots or roots, biomass in plant cell cultures or hairy root culture, and optimization of environmental conditions to achieve maximum productivity and efficiency, as well as classification of microshoots and somatic embryos. Despite its potential, the use of AI and OA in this field has been limited due to complex definition terms and computational algorithms. Therefore, a systematic review to unravel modeling and optimizing methods is important for plant researchers and has been acknowledged in this study. First, the main steps for AI-OA development (from data selection to evaluation of prediction and classification models), as well as several AI models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), neurofuzzy logic, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, random forest (FR), and genetic algorithms (GA), have been represented. Then, the application of AI-OA models in different steps of plant tissue culture has been discussed and highlighted. This review also points out limitations in the application of AI-OA in different plant tissue culture processes and provides a new view for future study objectives. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Artificial intelligence models and optimization algorithms can be considered a novel and reliable computational method in plant tissue culture. \u2022 This review provides the main steps and concepts for model development. \u2022 The application of machine learning algorithms in different steps of plant tissue culture has been discussed and highlighted.", "Lymph node metastases are a key prognostic factor in prostate cancer (PCa), but detecting lymph node lesions from PET/CT images is a subjective process resulting in inter-reader variability. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods can provide an objective image analysis. We aimed at developing and validating an AI-based tool for detection of lymph node lesions.\nA group of 399 patients with biopsy-proven PCa who had undergone 18 F-choline PET/CT for staging prior to treatment were used to train (n\u00a0=\u00a0319) and test (n\u00a0=\u00a080) the AI-based tool. The tool consisted of convolutional neural networks using complete PET/CT scans as inputs. In the test set, the AI-based lymph node detections were compared to those of two independent readers. The association with PCa-specific survival was investigated.\nThe AI-based tool detected more lymph node lesions than Reader B (98 vs. 87/117; p\u00a0=\u00a0.045) using Reader A as reference. AI-based tool and Reader A showed similar performance (90 vs. 87/111; p\u00a0=\u00a0.63) using Reader B as reference. The number of lymph node lesions detected by the AI-based tool, PSA, and curative treatment was significantly associated with PCa-specific survival.\nThis study shows the feasibility of using an AI-based tool for automated and objective interpretation of PET/CT images that can provide assessments of lymph node lesions comparable with that of experienced readers and prognostic information in PCa patients.", "Parental practices can affect children's weight and BMI and may even be related to a high prevalence of obesity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between parents' practices related to feeding their children and excess weight in preschoolers in Bucaramanga, Colombia, using artificial intelligence. A cross-sectional study was carried out between September and December 2017. The sample included preschoolers who attended child development institutions belonging to the Colombian Institute for Family Wellbeing in Bucaramanga and the metropolitan area (n 384). The outcome variable was excess weight and the main independent variable was parental feeding practices. Confounding variables analysed included sociodemographic characteristics, food consumption, and children's physical activity. All equipment for the anthropometric measurements was calibrated. Logistic regression was used to predict the effect of parental practices on the excess weight of the children, and the AUC was used to measure performance. The parental practices with the greatest association with excess weight in the children involved using food to control their behaviour and restricting the amount of food they offered (use of food to control emotions (OR 1\u00b777; 95 % CI 1\u00b745, 1\u00b783; P = 0\u00b7034) and encouraging children to eat less (OR 1\u00b722; 95 % CI 1\u00b714, 1\u00b789; P = 0\u00b7045)). Childrearing practices related to feeding were found to be an important predictor of excess weight in children. The results of this study represent implications for public health considering this as a baseline for the design of nutrition education interventions focused on parents of preschoolers.", "Most patients with primary aldosteronism, a major cause of secondary hypertension, are not identified or appropriately treated because of difficulties in diagnosis and subtype classification. Applications of artificial intelligence combined with mass spectrometry-based steroid profiling could address this problem.\nTo assess whether plasma steroid profiling combined with machine learning might facilitate diagnosis and treatment stratification of primary aldosteronism, particularly for patients with unilateral adenomas due to pathogenic KCNJ5 sequence variants.\nThis diagnostic study was conducted at multiple tertiary care referral centers. Steroid profiles were measured from June 2013 to March 2017 in 462 patients tested for primary aldosteronism and 201 patients with hypertension. Data analyses were performed from September 2018 to August 2019.\nThe aldosterone to renin ratio and saline infusion tests were used to diagnose primary aldosteronism. Subtyping was done by adrenal venous sampling and follow-up of patients who underwent adrenalectomy. Statistical tests and machine-learning algorithms were applied to plasma steroid profiles. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivity, specificity, and other diagnostic performance measures were calculated.\nPrimary aldosteronism was confirmed in 273 patients (165 men [60%]; mean [SD] age, 51 [10] years), including 134 with bilateral disease and 139 with unilateral adenomas (58 with and 81 without somatic KCNJ5 sequence variants). Plasma steroid profiles varied according to disease subtype and were particularly distinctive in patients with adenomas due to KCNJ5 variants, who showed better rates of biochemical cure after adrenalectomy than other patients. Among patients tested for primary aldosteronism, a selection of 8 steroids in combination with the aldosterone to renin ratio showed improved effectiveness for diagnosis over either strategy alone. In contrast, the steroid profile alone showed superior performance over the aldosterone to renin ratio for identifying unilateral disease, particularly adenomas due to KCNJ5 variants. Among 632 patients included in the analysis, machine learning-designed combinatorial marker profiles of 7 steroids alone both predicted primary aldosteronism in 1 step and subtyped patients with unilateral adenomas due to KCNJ5 variants at diagnostic sensitivities of 69% (95% CI, 68%-71%) and 85% (95% CI, 81%-88%), respectively, and at specificities of 94% (95% CI, 93%-94%) and 97% (95% CI, 97%-98%), respectively. The validation series yielded comparable diagnostic performance.\nMachine learning-designed combinatorial plasma steroid profiles may facilitate both screening for primary aldosteronism and identification of patients with unilateral adenomas due to pathogenic KCNJ5 variants, who are most likely to show benefit from surgical intervention.", "Based on Salovey and Mayer's conceptualization of emotional intelligence, Davies and colleagues developed the BEIS-10 scale, a 10-items self-report questionnaire that explores individual dispositions that people have about exploring one's own and others' emotions. To date, no studies assess the validity of the BEIS-10 scale in the Italian context. This article aims to fill this gap, exploring the validity, reliability, and construct validity of the Italian version of this scale. 244 Italian adults participated in the study and 67 respondents completed a second administration of the scale after two-weeks. The recommended statistical procedures were followed to validate the Italian version of the BEIS-10 scale and, after a back-translation process and a pilot testing, the five-factor structure of the scale was tested through a confirmatory factor analysis. Results highlighted that the five-factor model of emotional intelligence proposed by Davies and colleagues (2010) is confirmed in the Italian population. Data showed good reliability, good stability over time, and evidence of construct validity of the BEIS-10 scale. The BEIS-10 scale could be completed in a couple of minutes and it is particularly useful for collecting data in contexts in which time is an issue.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proposed as a potential tool to help address many of the existing problems related with empirical or subjective assessments of clinical and embryological decision points during the treatment of infertility. AI technologies are reviewed and potential areas of implementation of algorithms are discussed, highlighting the importance of following a proper path for the development and validation of algorithms, including regulatory requirements, and the need for ecosystems containing enough quality data to generate it. As evidenced by the consensus of a group of experts in fertility if properly developed, it is believed that AI algorithms may help practitioners from around the globe to standardize, automate, and improve IVF outcomes for the benefit of patients. Collaboration is required between AI developers and healthcare professionals to make this happen.", "With the artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm shift comes momentum toward the development and scale-up of novel AI interventions to aid in opioid use disorder (OUD) care, in the identification of overdose risk, and in the reversal of overdose.\nAs OUD-specific AI interventions are relatively recent, dynamic, and may not yet be captured in the peer-reviewed literature, we conducted a review of the gray literature to identify literature pertaining to OUD-specific AI interventions being developed, implemented and evaluated.\nGray literature databases, customized Google searches, and targeted websites were searched from January 2013 to October 2019. Search terms include: AI, machine learning, substance use disorder (SUD), and OUD. We also requested recommendations for relevant material from experts in this area.\nThis review yielded a total of 70 unique citations and 29 unique interventions, which can be sub-divided into five categories: smartphone applications (n\u00a0=\u00a012); healthcare data-related interventions (n\u00a0=\u00a07); biosensor-related interventions (n\u00a0=\u00a05); digital and virtual-related interventions (n\u00a0=\u00a02); and 'other', i.e., those that cannot be classified in these categories (n\u00a0=\u00a03). While the majority have not undergone rigorous scientific evaluation via randomized controlled trials, several AI interventions showed promise in aiding the identification of escalating opioid use patterns, informing the treatment of OUD, and detecting opioid-induced respiratory depression.\nThis is the first gray literature synthesis to characterize the current 'landscape' of OUD-specific AI interventions. Future research should continue to assess the usability, utility, acceptability and efficacy of these interventions, in addition to the overall legal, ethical, and social implications of OUD-specific AI interventions.", "Since 2007, we have gradually been building up infrastructure for digital pathology, starting with a whole slide scanner park to build up a digital archive to streamline doing multidisciplinary meetings, student teaching and research, culminating in a full digital diagnostic workflow where we are currently integrating artificial intelligence algorithms. In this paper, we highlight the different steps in this process towards digital diagnostics, which was at times a rocky road with definitely issues in implementation, but eventually an exciting new way to practice pathology in a more modern and efficient way where patient safety has clearly gone up.", "A model that predicts levels of coronavirus (CoV) respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials based on the shell disorder has been built using neural network (artificial intelligence, AI) analysis of the percentage of disorder (PID) in the nucleocapsid, N, and membrane, M, proteins of the inner and outer viral shells, respectively. Using primarily the PID of N, SARS-CoV-2 is grouped as having intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. Related studies, using similar methodologies, have found strong positive correlations between virulence and inner shell disorder among numerous viruses, including Nipah, Ebola, and Dengue viruses. There is some evidence that this is also true for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which have N PIDs of 48% and 50%, and case-fatality rates of 0.5-5% and 10.9%, respectively. The underlying relationship between virulence and respiratory potentials has to do with the viral loads of vital organs and body fluids, respectively. Viruses can spread by respiratory means only if the viral loads in saliva and mucus exceed certain minima. Similarly, a patient is likelier to die when the viral load overwhelms vital organs. Greater disorder in inner shell proteins has been known to play important roles in the rapid replication of viruses by enhancing the efficiency pertaining to protein-protein/DNA/RNA/lipid bindings. This paper suggests a novel strategy in attenuating viruses involving comparison of disorder patterns of inner shells (N) of related viruses to identify residues and regions that could be ideal for mutation. The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has one of the lowest M PID values (6%) in its family, and therefore, this virus has one of the hardest outer shells, which makes it resistant to antimicrobial enzymes in body fluid. While this is likely responsible for its greater contagiousness, the risks of creating an attenuated virus with a more disordered M are discussed.", "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have enabled impressive breakthroughs in various artificial intelligence (AI) applications recently due to its capability of learning high-level features from big data. However, the current demand of DNNs for computational resources especially the storage consumption is growing due to that the increasing sizes of models are being required for more and more complicated applications. To address this problem, several tensor decomposition methods including tensor-train (TT) and tensor-ring (TR) have been applied to compress DNNs and shown considerable compression effectiveness. In this work, we introduce the hierarchical Tucker (HT), a classical but rarely-used tensor decomposition method, to investigate its capability in neural network compression. We convert the weight matrices and convolutional kernels to both HT and TT formats for comparative study, since the latter is the most widely used decomposition method and the variant of HT. We further theoretically and experimentally discover that the HT format has better performance on compressing weight matrices, while the TT format is more suited for compressing convolutional kernels. Based on this phenomenon we propose a strategy of hybrid tensor decomposition by combining TT and HT together to compress convolutional and fully connected parts separately and attain better accuracy than only using the TT or HT format on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our work illuminates the prospects of hybrid tensor decomposition for neural network compression.", "Since the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, it has been constantly studied and has achieved rapid development. The AI assistant system is expected to improve the quality of automatic polyp detection and classification. It could also help prevent endoscopists from missing polyps and make an accurate optical diagnosis. These functions provided by AI could result in a higher adenoma detection rate and decrease the cost of polypectomy for hyperplastic polyps. In addition, AI has good performance in the staging, diagnosis, and segmentation of colorectal cancer. This article provides an overview of recent research focusing on the application of AI in colorectal polyps and cancer and highlights the advances achieved.", "Clinical event detection (CED) is a hot topic and essential task in medical artificial intelligence, which has attracted the attention from academia and industry over the recent years. However, most studies focus on English clinical narratives. Owing to the limitation of annotated Chinese medical corpus, there is a lack of relevant research about Chinese clinical narratives. The existing methods ignore the importance of contextual information in semantic understanding. Therefore, it is urgent to research multilingual clinical event detection. In this paper, we present a novel encoder-decoder structure based on pre-trained language model for Chinese CED task, which integrates contextual representations into Chinese character embeddings to assist model in semantic understanding. Compared with existing methods, our proposed strategy can help model harvest a language inferential skill. Besides, we introduce the punitive weight to adjust the proportion of loss on each category for coping with class imbalance problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct a range of experiments on test set of our manually annotated corpus. We compare overall performance of our proposed model with baseline models on our manually annotated corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves the best precision of 83.73%, recall of 86.56% and F1-score of 85.12%. Moreover, we also evaluate the performance of our proposed model with baseline models on minority category samples. We discover that our proposed model obtains a significant increase on minority category samples.", "Though contemporary scientific literature addressing the links between emotional intelligence (EI) and suicidal ideation in adolescents is scarce, one of the potential proposed pathways through which EI may reduce the risk of suicidal ideation involves its relationship with the use of adaptive coping strategies. The aim of this research is to provide support for an empirical pathway that proposes that the effects of EI on suicide risk may follow an indirect pathway, involving maladaptive and adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies, using both cross-sectional and prospective design in two independent studies with Spanish adolescents. The sample of Study 1 consisted of 1824 students (52.4% female; mean age 14.55 years). In Study 2, 796 adolescents (54.4% female; mean age 13.76 years) filled out the measures twice, four months later. The results confirmed a positive association between EI and adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies and a negative link with suicidal ideation. As expected, the results showed that both cross-sectionally (Study 1) and prospectively (Study 2) EI predicted lower suicidal ideation. Bootstrap mediation analysis indicated that only adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies partially mediated the link between EI and suicidal ideation both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Together, those adolescents who showed higher EI were more likely to report more adaptive cognitive emotion regulation, which in turn predicted lower levels of suicidal ideation. Our findings suggest possible avenues for prevention and intervention efforts aimed at boosting emotional abilities and developing adaptive coping strategies among adolescents who are at elevated suicide risk.", "In the media more and more can be read about \"care robots\" as a\u00a0possible solution for the current lack of qualified care staff but often without differentiating this term any further. This often leads to the assumption that robots are already able to take over physical care tasks with patients; however, current solutions primarily have assistive functions. The goal of this article is to elaborate for which application areas products already exist and which topics current research projects are dealing with based on concrete examples. On the one hand, assistive robots are presented that are designed to support staff in senior care institutions and hospitals. On the other hand, assistive robots are presented that support older persons or persons in need of care in their daily lives. These observations show that existing products either provide only reduced interaction capabilities or have only limited autonomy or \"intelligence\". Assistive robots providing more extensive, also physical interaction abilities and complex autonomous behavior are still a\u00a0research topic.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and radiologists have recently reported AI systems that accurately detect COVID-19 in chest radiographs. However, the robustness of these systems remains unclear. Using state-of-the-art techniques in explainable AI, we demonstrate that recent deep learning systems to detect COVID-19 from chest radiographs rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology, creating an alarming situation in which the systems appear accurate, but fail when tested in new hospitals. We observe that the approach to obtain training data for these AI systems introduces a nearly ideal scenario for AI to learn these spurious \"shortcuts.\" Because this approach to data collection has also been used to obtain training data for detection of COVID-19 in computed tomography scans and for medical imaging tasks related to other diseases, our study reveals a far-reaching problem in medical imaging AI. In addition, we show that evaluation of a model on external data is insufficient to ensure AI systems rely on medically relevant pathology, since the undesired \"shortcuts\" learned by AI systems may not impair performance in new hospitals. These findings demonstrate that explainable AI should be seen as a prerequisite to clinical deployment of ML healthcare models.", "Lesions missed by colonoscopy are one of the main reasons for post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer, which is usually associated with a worse prognosis. Because the adenoma miss rate could be as high as 26%, it has been noted that endoscopists with higher adenoma detection rates are usually associated with lower adenoma miss rates. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the deep learning model, is a promising innovation in colonoscopy. Recent studies have shown that AI is not only accurate in colorectal polyp detection but can also reduce the miss rate. Nevertheless, the application of AI in real-time detection has been hindered by heterogeneity of the AI models and study design as well as a lack of long-term outcomes. Herein, we discussed the principle of various AI models and systematically reviewed the current data on the use of AI on colorectal polyp detection and miss rates. The limitations and future prospects of AI on colorectal polyp detection are also discussed.", "Lack of a balanced diet can have a significant impact on most organs of the body. Traditionally, evaluation of these conditions relied heavily upon body mass index \"BMI\" measurements, which are limited and open to inaccurate interpretation or omission of critical data. Advances in imaging allow better recognition of these conditions using accurate qualitative and quantitative data and correlation with any morphological changes in organs. Body composition evaluations include the assessment of the bone mineral density (BMD), visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, liver fat and iron overload and muscle fat (including the lean muscle ratio), with differential evaluation of specific muscle groups when required. Such measurements are important as a baseline and for monitoring the effect of therapies and various interventions. In addition, they may predict and help alleviate any potential complications, allowing counselling of patients in a relatable manner. This positively influences patient compliance and outcomes during early counselling, monitoring and modulation of therapy. This encourages patients suffering from obesity and eating disorders to better understand their often chronic but reversible condition. We present a review of current literature with reflection on our own practices. We discuss the importance of monitoring the reversibility of certain parameters in specific cohorts of patients. We consider the role of artificial intelligence and deep learning in developing software algorithms that can help the reading radiologist evaluate large volumes of data and present the results in a format that is easier to interpret, thereby reducing interobserver and intraobserver variabilities.", "This paper presents an integrated technical framework to protect pipelines against both malicious intrusions and piping degradation using a distributed fiber sensing technology and artificial intelligence. A distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system based on phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry (\u03c6-OTDR) was used to detect acoustic wave propagation and scattering along pipeline structures consisting of straight piping and sharp bend elbow. Signal to noise ratio of the DAS system was enhanced by femtosecond induced artificial Rayleigh scattering centers. Data harnessed by the DAS system were analyzed by neural network-based machine learning algorithms. The system identified with over 85% accuracy in various external impact events, and over 94% accuracy for defect identification through supervised learning and 71% accuracy through unsupervised learning.", "Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke worldwide. Along with high recurrent stroke risk from ICAD, its association with cognitive decline and dementia leads to a substantial decrease in quality of life and a high economic burden. Atherosclerotic lesions can range from slight wall thickening with plaques that are angiographically occult to severely stenotic lesions. Recent advances in intracranial high resolution vessel wall MR (VW-MR) imaging have enabled imaging beyond the lumen to characterize the vessel wall and its pathology. This technique has opened new avenues of research for identifying vulnerable plaque in the setting of acute ischemic stroke as well as assessing ICAD burden and its associations with its sequela, such as dementia. We now understand more about the intracranial arterial wall, its ability to remodel with disease and how we can use VW-MR to identify angiographically occult lesions and assess medical treatment responses, for example, to statin therapy. Our growing understanding of ICAD with intracranial VW-MR imaging can profoundly impact diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis for ischemic stroke with the possibility of lesion-based risk models to tailor and personalize treatment. In this review, we discuss the advantages of intracranial VW-MR imaging for ICAD, the potential of bioimaging markers to identify vulnerable intracranial plaque, and future directions of artificial intelligence and its utility for lesion scoring and assessment.", "I present a theory of adaptive intelligence and discuss why I believe adaptive intelligence, rather than general intelligence, is the kind of intelligence upon which we should focus in today's world. Adaptive intelligence is the ability to adapt to, shape, and select real-world environments in ways that result in positive outcomes not only for oneself, but also for others and the world. Edward Zigler was among the first to recognize the importance of levels of adaptation to intellectual deficiency, arguing from early on that intellectual challenges needed to be recognized not just in terms of IQ but also in terms of adaptive functioning. Adaptive intelligence is compared to and contrasted with general intelligence, which is usually defined as the first factor in a factor analysis of psychometric tests. I first introduce the main issues in the article. Then I discuss how one even would decide what intelligence is. Next I discuss broader theories of intelligence and especially the theory of adaptive intelligence. Then I talk about the perishability of theories of intelligence and other things-to what extent are they set up so that people are willing and able to move beyond them? Finally, I discuss how individual outcomes do not necessarily predict collective outcomes.", "Urban noise is one of the most serious and underestimated environmental problems. According to the World Health Organization, noise pollution from traffic and other human activities, negatively impact the population health and life quality. Monitoring noise usually requires the use of professional and expensive instruments, called phonometers, able to accurately measure sound pressure levels. In many cases, phonometers are human-operated; therefore, periodic fine-granularity city-wide measurements are expensive. Recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) offer a window of opportunities for low-cost autonomous sound pressure meters. Such devices and platforms could enable fine time-space noise measurements throughout a city. Unfortunately, low-cost sound pressure sensors are inaccurate when compared with phonometers, experiencing a high variability in the measurements. In this paper, we present RaveGuard, an unmanned noise monitoring platform that exploits artificial intelligence strategies to improve the accuracy of low-cost devices. RaveGuard was initially deployed together with a professional phonometer for over two months in downtown Bologna, Italy, with the aim of collecting a large amount of precise noise pollution samples. The resulting datasets have been instrumental in designing InspectNoise, a library that can be exploited by IoT platforms, without the need of expensive phonometers, but obtaining a similar precision. In particular, we have applied supervised learning algorithms (adequately trained with our datasets) to reduce the accuracy gap between the professional phonometer and an IoT platform equipped with low-end devices and sensors. Results show that RaveGuard, combined with the InspectNoise library, achieves a 2.24% relative error compared to professional instruments, thus enabling low-cost unmanned city-wide noise monitoring.", "People have traditionally associated being 'not ill' with being 'healthy'. This concept has changed due to the improvement of Taiwan's population structure, advances in medical care, and better education. The word 'health' is defined by the World Health Organization as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. In the future, people in Taiwan must address the challenges of population aging and create a society oriented to the long-term care needs of its citizens. People have different healthcare requirements during the respective stages of healthy, sub-healthy, and disability. Advancing technology has allowed the creation of many healthcare applications such as \"health big data\" that incorporate Internet of things (IoT) capabilities. Applying artificial intelligence opens many new possibilities and solutions. This article was written to introduce the application of big data techniques in smart healthcare that are appropriate to the three stages of healthy, sub-healthy, and disability.", "Calculating the magnitude of treatment effects or of differences between two groups is a common task in quantitative science. Standard effect size measures based on differences, such as the commonly used Cohen's, fail to capture the treatment-related effects on the data if the effects were not reflected by the central tendency. The present work aims at (i) developing a non-parametric alternative to Cohen's d, which (ii) circumvents some of its numerical limitations and (iii) involves obvious changes in the data that do not affect the group means and are therefore not captured by Cohen's d.\nWe propose \"Impact\" as a novel non-parametric measure of effect size obtained as the sum of two separate components and includes (i) a difference-based effect size measure implemented as the change in the central tendency of the group-specific data normalized to pooled variability and (ii) a data distribution shape-based effect size measure implemented as the difference in probability density of the group-specific data. Results obtained on artificial and empirical data showed that \"Impact\"is superior to Cohen's d by its additional second component in detecting clearly visible effects not reflected in central tendencies. The proposed effect size measure is invariant to the scaling of the data, reflects changes in the central tendency in cases where differences in the shape of probability distributions between subgroups are negligible, but captures changes in probability distributions as effects and is numerically stable even if the variances of the data set or its subgroups disappear.\nThe proposed effect size measure shares the ability to observe such an effect with machine learning algorithms. Therefore, the proposed effect size measure is particularly well suited for data science and artificial intelligence-based knowledge discovery from big and heterogeneous data.", "In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in research papers about machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence in radiology. With so many papers around, it is of paramount importance to make a proper scientific quality assessment as to their validity, reliability, effectiveness, and clinical applicability. Due to methodological complexity, the papers on ML in radiology are often hard to evaluate, requiring a good understanding of key methodological issues. In this review, we aimed to guide the radiology community about key methodological aspects of ML to improve their academic reading and peer-review experience. Key aspects of ML pipeline were presented within four broad categories: study design, data handling, modelling, and reporting. Sixteen key methodological items and related common pitfalls were reviewed with a fresh perspective: database size, robustness of reference standard, information leakage, feature scaling, reliability of features, high dimensionality, perturbations in feature selection, class balance, bias-variance trade-off, hyperparameter tuning, performance metrics, generalisability, clinical utility, comparison with traditional tools, data sharing, and transparent reporting.Key Points\u2022 Machine learning is new and rather complex for the radiology community.\u2022 Validity, reliability, effectiveness, and clinical applicability of studies on machine learning can be evaluated with a proper understanding of key methodological concepts about study design, data handling, modelling, and reporting.\u2022 Understanding key methodological concepts will provide a better academic reading and peer-review experience for the radiology community.", "Pet rabbit welfare is a hidden crisis: Inappropriately housed, fed, and not routinely provided healthcare-rabbits can often suffer painful conditions and shortened lifespans. This study provides novel understanding of owners' perceptions of rabbits' mental capabilities; how this impacts their husbandry; and subsequent effects on rabbits' welfare. A survey was designed to investigate owner and rabbit demographics, owner perception of rabbits, resources provided, and rabbit behavior. Distributed online and by the Rabbit Welfare Association and Fund, the survey received 1516 responses. It was found that increased owner perceptions of pain, emotions. and intelligence resulted in increased likelihood of providing a partner, increased enrichment variation, and a more appropriate diet and type of housing. Welfare scores were associated with diet, housing, variety of enrichment, and time spent with owners. These results suggest that a practical approach to improving the welfare standard provided to rabbits may be to target improving owner perceptions of the species' intelligence, emotionality, and experience of pain. This information would be beneficial in tailoring public education programs to increase provision of welfare enhancing resources, improve the human-animal relationship, and thus improve the welfare standards for this species.", "Information processing speed is commonly measured in intelligence and neuropsychological testing, and the scores from speed measures are considered in diagnostic and management recommendations for students with academic learning problems. However, this score usage often depends on assumptions about strong relationships between cognitive speed and the ability to perform actual academic tasks under time pressure. The primary purpose of the present study was to test the strength of these relationships empirically. In the present study, children with prior learning disability diagnoses (146 girls and 301 boys, ages 10-14\u2009years old) completed diagnostic batteries that included measures of cognitive speed as well as timed academic skills. The relationships between the two types of measures were often modest (median r\u2009=\u20090.25), and the gap between processing speed and timed academic scores was typically approximately 1 standard deviation. The pattern of relationships suggested that superficial similarity in stimuli and task demands affected the strength of associations. These results suggest that timed academic skills cannot be reliably estimated based on processing speed scores, and there will often be significant gaps between the two. Therefore, making diagnostic judgments (e.g., learning disability diagnoses) or management recommendations (e.g., for extended time testing accommodations) should be based on more direct measures of relevant academic skills.", "To present a systematic review of the presence and severity of neuropsychological impairment in the six main neuropsychological domains (attention, executive function, language, visuospatial processing, intelligence, and memory) in patients with Cushing's disease (CD) and/or Cushing's Syndrome (CS) at various stages of the illness. The work aims to identify neuropsychological leverage points for focused diagnosis and rehabilitation in CS/CD patients.\nA pubmed literature search was performed and augmented by searching the reference lists of review articles identified by this search strategy. After excluding irrelevant hits, we systematically extracted data from 27 studies for each main neuropsychological domain, differentiating between active disease, short- and long-term remission.\nThe literature gives evidence for neuropsychological impairment in all domains in Cushing patients with active disease. The most consistent impairments concerned memory and visuo-spatial processing, whereas the data are discordant for all other domains. Significant improvement of neuropsychological function - although not returning to normal in all domains - is shown in short-term and long-term remission of the disease. However, the published literature is thin, suffering from repetitive subsample analyses publishing, methodological concerns as lack of control for confounders such as depression.\nMemory is the most extensively investigated domain in CS/CD patients and impairment is most prominent in active disease. Patients should be counseled that neuropsychological function will improve with normalization of hypercortisolism and over time. More studies with more stringent methodological criteria, larger patient samples and controlling for confounders are required to enhance our understanding of neuropsychological function in patients with CS/CD.", "Mass gathering (MG) events are associated with public health risks. During the period January 14 to March 4, 2019, Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, India was attended by an estimated 120 million visitors. An onsite disease surveillance was established to identify and respond to disease outbreaks.\nA health coordination committee was established for planning. Disease surveillance was prioritized and risk assessment was done to identify diseases/conditions based on epidemic potential, severity of illness, and reporting requirement under the International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005. A daily indicator and event-based disease surveillance was planned. The indicator-based surveillance (IBS) manually and electronically recorded data from patient hospital visits and collected MG area water testing data to assess trends. The event-based surveillance (EBS) helped identify outbreak signals based on pre-identified event triggers from the media, private health facilities, and the food safety department. Epidemic intelligence was used to analyse the data and events to detect signals, verify alerts, and initiate the response.\nAt Kumbh Mela, disease surveillance was established for 22 acute diseases/syndromes. Sixty-five health facilities reported 156 154 illnesses (21% of a total 738 526 hospital encounters). Among the reported illnesses, 95% (n = 148 834) were communicable diseases such as acute respiratory illness (n = 52 504, 5%), acute fever (n = 41 957, 28%), and skin infections (n = 27 094, 18%). The remaining 5% (n = 7300) were non-communicable diseases (injuries n = 6601, 90%; hypothermia n = 224, 3%; burns n = 210, 3%). Water samples tested inadequate for residual chlorine in 20% of samples (102/521). The incident command centre generated 12 early warning signals from IBS and EBS: acute diarrheal disease (n = 8, 66%), vector-borne disease (n = 2, 16%), vaccine-preventable disease (n = 1, 8%), and thermal event (n = 1, 8%). There were two outbreaks (acute gastroenteritis and chickenpox) that were investigated and controlled.\nThis onsite disease surveillance imparted a public health legacy by successfully implementing an epidemic intelligence enabled system for early disease detection and response to monitor public health risks. Acute respiratory illnesses emerged as a leading cause of morbidity among visitors. Future MG events should include disease surveillance as part of planning and augment capacity for acute respiratory illness diagnosis and management.", "Precision medicine relies upon artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies that raise ethical and practical concerns. In this study, we developed and validated a measure of parental openness and concerns with AI-driven technologies in their child's healthcare. In this cross-sectional survey, we enrolled parents of children <18 years in 2 rounds for exploratory (n = 418) and confirmatory (n = 386) factor analysis. We developed a 12-item measure of parental openness to AI-driven technologies, and a 33-item measure identifying concerns that parents found important when considering these technologies. We also evaluated associations between openness and attitudes, beliefs, personality traits, and demographics. Parents (N = 804) reported mean openness to AI-driven technologies of M = 3.4/5, SD = 0.9. We identified seven concerns that parents considered important when evaluating these technologies: quality/accuracy, privacy, shared decision making, convenience, cost, human element of care, and social justice. In multivariable linear regression, parental openness was positively associated with quality (beta = 0.23), convenience (beta = 0.16), and cost (beta = 0.11), as well as faith in technology (beta = 0.23) and trust in health information systems (beta = 0.12). Parental openness was negatively associated with the perceived importance of shared decision making (beta = -0.16) and being female (beta = -0.12). Developers might support parental openness by addressing these concerns during the development and implementation of novel AI-driven technologies.", "Drug repurposing or repositioning is a technique whereby existing drugs are used to treat emerging and challenging diseases, including COVID-19. Drug repurposing has become a promising approach because of the opportunity for reduced development timelines and overall costs. In the big data era, artificial intelligence (AI) and network medicine offer cutting-edge application of information science to defining disease, medicine, therapeutics, and identifying targets with the least error. In this Review, we introduce guidelines on how to use AI for accelerating drug repurposing or repositioning, for which AI approaches are not just formidable but are also necessary. We discuss how to use AI models in precision medicine, and as an example, how AI models can accelerate COVID-19 drug repurposing. Rapidly developing, powerful, and innovative AI and network medicine technologies can expedite therapeutic development. This Review provides a strong rationale for using AI-based assistive tools for drug repurposing medications for human disease, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Infection with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a worldwide pandemic with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, overwhelming healthcare systems globally. Preliminary reports suggest a high incidence of infection and mortality with SARS-CoV-2 in patients receiving kidney replacement therapy (KRT). The aims of this study are to report characteristics, rates and outcomes of all patients affected by infection with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing KRT in Scotland.\nStudy design was an observational cohort study. Data were linked between the Scottish Renal Registry, Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group national data sets using a unique patient identifier (Community Health Index (CHI)) for each individual by the Public Health and Intelligence unit of Public Health, Scotland. Descriptive statistics and survival analyses were performed.\nDuring the period 1st March 2020 to 31st May 2020, 110 patients receiving KRT tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 amounting to 2% of the prevalent KRT population. Of those affected, 86 were receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and 24 had a renal transplant. Patients who tested positive were older and more likely to reside in more deprived postcodes. Mortality was high at 26.7% in the dialysis patients and 29.2% in the transplant patients.\nThe rate of detected SARS-CoV-2 in people receiving KRT in Scotland was relatively low but with a high mortality for those demonstrating infection. Although impossible to confirm, it appears that the measures taken within dialysis units coupled with the national shielding policy, have been effective in protecting this population from infection.", "Man&#8217;s social nature and capabilities set him up as a creator of culture. Culture is inherent to its human nature and encompasses all the dimensions of its person, its biology, its intelligence, its affectivity and also its ethical dimension. There is no other being in our world that creates and transmits culture; culture is of man and for man. Therefore, it unites us to past generations and at the same time commits us to the future, since we assume the legacy of human history and develop our own to launch it into the future to create and participate in cultural advancement and progress.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an urgent call to contribute to the fight against an immense threat to the human population. Computer Vision, as a subfield of artificial intelligence, has enjoyed recent success in solving various complex problems in health care and has the potential to contribute to the fight of controlling COVID-19. In response to this call, computer vision researchers are putting their knowledge base at test to devise effective ways to counter COVID-19 challenge and serve the global community. New contributions are being shared with every passing day. It motivated us to review the recent work, collect information about available research resources, and an indication of future research directions. We want to make it possible for computer vision researchers to find existing and future research directions. This survey article presents a preliminary review of the literature on research community efforts against COVID-19 pandemic.", "Purpose The two primary purposes of this report are (a) to compare the results of three brief cognitive screens in older adults and (b) to examine associations between performance on each of the screens and auditory function measured either concurrently or 9 years earlier. Method This was a prospective longitudinal study of 98 adults (66 women) with baseline ages ranging from 40 to 85 years. The mean interval between T1 baseline and T2 follow-up measurements was 8.8 years with a range from 7 to 11 years. Measures of hearing threshold, gap detection, and auditory temporal-order identification were completed at T1 and T2. The Mini-Mental State Examination was completed at T1 and T2, whereas the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and A Quick Test were completed at T2 only. Results Higher scores and pass rates were obtained for the Mini-Mental State Examination than for the MoCA or the A Quick Test. The measures were moderately correlated among themselves and with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition. Significant associations emerged frequently between auditory and cognitive functions, most often for the auditory measure of temporal-order identification, including dichotic measures of this ability. Conclusions From this evaluation, the MoCA emerged as the preferred test for clinicians desiring a quick assessment of the cognitive function of their older patients. Auditory temporal-order identification is associated with cognitive function and explains about 10%-20% of the variation in cognitive function independent of age and hearing loss.

This is an important problem because the availability of effective methods for the computation of patient similarity would allow for assistance with and automation of tasks such as patients stratification, medical prognosis and cohort selection, and for unlocking the potential of medical analytics methods for healthcare intelligence. However, health data in EHRs presents many challenges that make the automatic computation of patient similarity difficult; these include: temporal aspects, multivariate, heterogeneous and irregular data, and data sparsity.\nWe propose a new method for EHR data representation called Temporal Tree: a temporal hierarchical representation which, based on temporal co-occurrence, preserves the compound information found at different levels in health data. In addition, this representation is augmented using the doc2vec embedding technique which here is exploited for patient similarity computation. We empirically investigate our proposed method, along with several state-of-the-art benchmarks, on a dataset of real world Intensive Care Unit (ICU) EHRs, for the task of identifying patients with a specific target diagnosis.\nOur empirical results show that the Temporal Trees representation is significantly better than other traditional and state-of-the-art methods for representing patients and computing their similarities.\nTemporal trees capture the temporal relationships between medical, hierarchical data: this enables to effectively model the rich information provided within EHRs and thus the identification of similar patients.", "Existing research suggests that parental absence per se does not have a main effect on children's cognitive development. However, this body of research is confounded by decreased family finance resulted from parental absence. Further insights on children's cognitive development can be gained by studying situations where parental absence actually leads to higher family finance. China's rural left-behind children (LBC) are uniquely suited for this purpose because of their extended separation from parents who migrated to work for better family finance. The participants were 74 LBC (M\u00a0=\u00a09.99 years, SD\u00a0=\u00a02.66) whose parents both migrated away for work within six months of their births and 74 non-left-behind children (NLBC) (M\u00a0=\u00a010.03 years, SD\u00a0=\u00a02.58) of similar backgrounds but whose parents never migrated. We used the 4th Edition of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) to individually collected data on the children's Verbal Comprehension (which includes Similarities, Vocabulary, and Comprehension subtests), Perceptual Reasoning (which includes Block Design, Picture Concepts and Matric Reasoning subtests), Working Memory (which includes Digit Span and Letter-Number Sequencing subtests), and Processing Speed (which includes Coding and Symbol Search subtests). We found that the LBC scored lower than the NLBC on the language Comprehension and Vocabulary subtests of the Verbal Comprehension Index (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a00.41; p\u00a0=\u00a0.01). Subsequent General Linear Modeling analyses revealed that for the Comprehension subtest: (1) dual-parental absence significantly and negatively predicted Comprehension scores and (2) monthly family income significantly and positively predicted Comprehension scores for the LBC but not for the NLBC. For Vocabulary subtest, only dual-parental absence was significant. Overall, these results offer a deeper understanding on the effect of dual parental absence and changes in family finance on different domains of children's cognitive development.", "Nurses require leadership skills in order to fulfil their clinical role in an ever-changing healthcare environment. The acquisition of such skills should therefore begin during their professional training.\nTo identify the dimensions of leadership present among nursing undergraduates in the original Self-Assessment Leadership Instrument (SALI).\nThis was a validation study involving the translation and cultural adaptation of the Self-Assessment Leadership Instrument (SALI) for use with nursing undergraduates in the Spanish context.\nFaculty of Medicine and Health Sciences in Spain.\nParticipants were 280 nursing undergraduates (years 1-4) from a Spanish university. The SALI was adapted following the back-translation procedure, and its psychometric properties (validity and reliability) were analyzed.\nThe Spanish version of the SALI maintains the 40 items of the original scale. Scores on the Spanish SALI were positively and significantly correlated (0.542, p\u00a0=\u00a0.000) with scores on the General Self-Efficacy Scale (convergent scale) and negatively and significantly correlated (-0.348, p\u00a0=\u00a0.000) with the total score on the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (divergent scale). Factor analysis indicated that scores on the Spanish SALI loaded on four dimensions: Strategic thinking, Emotional intelligence, Impact and influence, and Teamwork skills, which together accounted for 43.42% of the total variance. Cronbach's alpha for the total scale was 0.870 (range 0.688-0.781 for the four dimensions). Test-retest reliability over a 15-day interval was high (ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.929, p\u00a0=\u00a0.000).\nThe study has identified four key dimensions of leadership that nursing students need to acquire and provides a valid and reliable tool for assessing them. This will enable nurse educators to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching initiatives aimed at developing these competences.", "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of autosomal recessive inherited neurodegenerative disorders mainly affecting children, and at least 13 causative genes (CLN1 to CLN8 and CLN10 to CLN14) have been identified. Here, we reported a novel homozygous missense mutation (c.434G > C, p.Arg145Pro) identified in CLN5 gene via whole exome sequencing in a 5-year-old girl. The patient first presented paroxysmal epilepsy associated with vomiting, followed by progressive regression in walking, vision, intelligence and speaking. Combining the molecular and clinical analysis, the diagnosis of NCL could be made, although the missense mutation (c.434G > C, p.Arg145Pro) in CLN5 was evaluated to be a variant of uncertain significance according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) standard. We further performed expression and localization studies and our results provide evidence of impaired cellular trafficking of CLN5 to lysosome, indicating that this mutation might be deleterious to the function of CLN5 for its mislocalization. Our study demonstrated the efficacy of next generation sequencing in molecular diagnosis, and a deleterious effect of the variant discovered in our patient on CLN5, triggering the NCL disease.", "The improvement of pulmonary nodule detection, which is a challenging task when using chest radiographs, may help to elevate the role of chest radiographs for the diagnosis of lung cancer.\nTo assess the performance of a deep learning-based nodule detection algorithm for the detection of lung cancer on chest radiographs from participants in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST).\nThis diagnostic study used data from participants in the NLST ro assess the performance of a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for the detection of pulmonary nodules and lung cancer on chest radiographs using separate training (in-house) and validation (NLST) data sets. Baseline (T0) posteroanterior chest radiographs from 5485 participants (full T0 data set) were used to assess lung cancer detection performance, and a subset of 577 of these images (nodule data set) were used to assess nodule detection performance. Participants aged 55 to 74 years who currently or formerly (ie, quit within the past 15 years) smoked cigarettes for 30 pack-years or more were enrolled in the NLST at 23 US centers between August 2002 and April 2004. Information on lung cancer diagnoses was collected through December 31, 2009. Analyses were performed between August 20, 2019, and February 14, 2020.\nAbnormality scores produced by the AI algorithm.\nThe performance of an AI algorithm for the detection of lung nodules and lung cancer on radiographs, with lung cancer incidence and mortality as primary end points.\nA total of 5485 participants (mean [SD] age, 61.7 [5.0] years; 3030 men [55.2%]) were included, with a median follow-up duration of 6.5 years (interquartile range, 6.1-6.9 years). For the nodule data set, the sensitivity and specificity of the AI algorithm for the detection of pulmonary nodules were 86.2% (95% CI, 77.8%-94.6%) and 85.0% (95% CI, 81.9%-88.1%), respectively. For the detection of all cancers, the sensitivity was 75.0% (95% CI, 62.8%-87.2%), the specificity was 83.3% (95% CI, 82.3%-84.3%), the positive predictive value was 3.8% (95% CI, 2.6%-5.0%), and the negative predictive value was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.6%-99.9%). For the detection of malignant pulmonary nodules in all images of the full T0 data set, the sensitivity was 94.1% (95% CI, 86.2%-100.0%), the specificity was 83.3% (95% CI, 82.3%-84.3%), the positive predictive value was 3.4% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.5%), and the negative predictive value was 100.0% (95% CI, 99.9%-100.0%). In digital radiographs of the nodule data set, the AI algorithm had higher sensitivity (96.0% [95% CI, 88.3%-100.0%] vs 88.0% [95% CI, 75.3%-100.0%]; P\u2009=\u2009.32) and higher specificity (93.2% [95% CI, 89.9%-96.5%] vs 82.8% [95% CI, 77.8%-87.8%]; P\u2009=\u2009.001) for nodule detection compared with the NLST radiologists. For malignant pulmonary nodule detection on digital radiographs of the full T0 data set, the sensitivity of the AI algorithm was higher (100.0% [95% CI, 100.0%-100.0%] vs 94.1% [95% CI, 82.9%-100.0%]; P\u2009=\u2009.32) compared with the NLST radiologists, and the specificity (90.9% [95% CI, 89.6%-92.1%] vs 91.0% [95% CI, 89.7%-92.2%]; P\u2009=\u2009.91), positive predictive value (8.2% [95% CI, 4.4%-11.9%] vs 7.8% [95% CI, 4.1%-11.5%]; P\u2009=\u2009.65), and negative predictive value (100.0% [95% CI, 100.0%-100.0%] vs 99.9% [95% CI, 99.8%-100.0%]; P\u2009=\u2009.32) were similar to those of NLST radiologists.\nIn this study, the AI algorithm performed better than NLST radiologists for the detection of pulmonary nodules on digital radiographs. When used as a second reader, the AI algorithm may help to detect lung cancer.", "Compelling facial expression recognition (FER) processes have been utilized in very successful fields like computer vision, robotics, artificial intelligence, and dynamic texture recognition. However, the FER's critical problem with traditional local binary pattern (LBP) is the loss of neighboring pixels related to different scales that can affect the texture of facial images. To overcome such limitations, this study describes a new extended LBP method to extract feature vectors from images, detecting each image from facial expressions. The proposed method is based on the bitwise AND operation of two rotational kernels applied on LBP(8,1) and LBP(8,2) and utilizes two accessible datasets. Firstly, the facial parts are detected and the essential components of a face are observed, such as eyes, nose, and lips. The portion of the face is then cropped to reduce the dimensions and an unsharp masking kernel is applied to sharpen the image. The filtered images then go through the feature extraction method and wait for the classification process. Four machine learning classifiers were used to verify the proposed method. This study shows that the proposed multi-scale featured local binary pattern (MSFLBP), together with Support Vector Machine (SVM), outperformed the recent LBP-based state-of-the-art approaches resulting in an accuracy of 99.12% for the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset and 89.08% for the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) dataset.", "Current hardware approaches to biomimetic or neuromorphic artificial intelligence rely on elaborate transistor circuits to simulate biological functions. However, these can instead be more faithfully emulated by higher-order circuit elements that naturally express neuromorphic nonlinear dynamics1-4. Generating neuromorphic action potentials in a circuit element theoretically requires a minimum of third-order complexity (for example, three dynamical electrophysical processes)5, but there have been few examples of second-order neuromorphic elements, and no previous demonstration of any isolated third-order element6-8. Using both experiments and modelling, here we show how multiple electrophysical processes-including Mott transition dynamics-form a nanoscale third-order circuit element. We demonstrate simple transistorless networks of third-order elements that perform Boolean operations and find analogue solutions to a computationally hard graph-partitioning problem. This work paves a way towards very compact and densely functional neuromorphic computing primitives, and energy-efficient validation of neuroscientific models.", "Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience spatial working memory deficits and show different encoding mechanisms from typical developing (TD) peers. To effectively describe the encoding strategies of those with ASD and highlight their characteristics in cognitive processing, we adopted improved change detection tasks and added eye-movement indicators to investigate the chunking function and reference preference of children with and without ASD. The current study included 20 participants with ASD aged 8-16 and 20 TD children matched for age, gender, and intelligence. Experiment 1 used high/low-structured change detection tasks, and eye-movement indexes were recorded as they memorized the locations of the items to investigate spatial chunking strategies. In Experiment 2, changes in eye movement patterns were observed by adding a frame of reference. The results suggested different encoding strategies in ASD and TD individuals. The ASD group showed local processing bias and had difficulty adopting chunking strategies in spatial working memory. Eye-movement analysis suggested that they rarely showed integrated information processing tendency observed in TD children. Moreover, as a compensatory processing, they were more likely to use the frame of reference. In this study, we compared the spatial chunking strategies and reference preference of children with and without ASD, and eye-movement analysis was used to investigate the processing mechanism. These findings are significant for research on cognitive characteristics of ASD and provide a new focus for working memory training in children with ASD. LAY SUMMARY: The current study suggests that children with autism spectrum disorder are poorer at organizing items into chunks in spatial working memory, but rely more on reference frames. If the purpose of location memory is to strengthen the adaptability of children with autism, it should provide them with more clues or references. If it is for the purpose of intervention such as cognitive training, it should guide them to integrate information to improve the basic cognitive processing efficiency.

These alternative driving modes will benefit from new research toward novel steering control devices, more suitably where machine intelligence only partially controls the vehicle. In this article, it is proposed that when the human shares the control of a vehicle with an autonomous or semiautonomous system, a force control, or nondisplacement steering wheel (i.e., a steering wheel which does not rotate but detects the applied torque by the human driver) can be advantageous under certain schemes: tight rein or loose rein modes according to the H -metaphor. We support this proposition with the first experiments to the best of our knowledge, in which human participants drove in a simulated road scene with a force control steering wheel (FCSW). The experiments exhibited that humans can adapt promptly to force control steering and are able to control the vehicle smoothly. Different transfer functions are tested, which translate the applied torque at the FCSW to the steering angle at the wheels of the vehicle; it is shown that fractional order transfer functions increment steering stability and control accuracy when using a force control device. The transition of control experiments is also performed with both: a conventional and an FCSW. This prototypical steering system can be realized via steer-by-wire controls, which are already incorporated in commercially available vehicles.", "This study reviews the current status and future prospective of knowledge on the use of artificial intelligence for the prediction of spontaneous preterm labor and birth (\"preterm birth\" hereafter). The summary of review suggests that different machine learning approaches would be optimal for different types of data regarding the prediction of preterm birth: the artificial neural network, logistic regression and/or the random forest for numeric data; the support vector machine for electrohysterogram data; the recurrent neural network for text data; and the convolutional neural network for image data. The ranges of performance measures were 0.79-0.94 for accuracy, 0.22-0.97 for sensitivity, 0.86-1.00 for specificity, and 0.54-0.83 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The following maternal variables were reported to be major determinants of preterm birth: delivery and pregestational body mass index, age, parity, predelivery systolic and diastolic blood pressure, twins, below high school graduation, infant sex, prior preterm birth, progesterone medication history, upper gastrointestinal tract symptom, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Helicobacter pylori, urban region, calcium channel blocker medication history, gestational diabetes mellitus, prior cone biopsy, cervical length, myomas and adenomyosis, insurance, marriage, religion, systemic lupus erythematosus, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and increased cerebrospinal fluid and reduced cortical folding due to impaired brain growth.", "General movements (GMs) are spontaneous movements of infants up to five months post-term involving the whole body varying in sequence, speed, and amplitude. The assessment of GMs has shown its importance for identifying infants at risk for neuromotor deficits, especially for the detection of cerebral palsy. As the assessment is based on videos of the infant that are rated by trained professionals, the method is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, approaches based on Artificial Intelligence have gained significantly increased attention in the last years. In this article, we systematically analyze and discuss the main design features of all existing technological approaches seeking to transfer the Prechtl's assessment of general movements from an individual visual perception to computer-based analysis. After identifying their shared shortcomings, we explain the methodological reasons for their limited practical performance and classification rates. As a conclusion of our literature study, we conceptually propose a methodological solution to the defined problem based on the groundbreaking innovation in the area of Deep Learning.", "The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is one of the largest and established longitudinal populational cohorts. CT cohorts of the FHS since 2002 provided a unique opportunity to assess non-cardiac thoracic imaging findings. This review deals with image-based phenotyping studies from recent major publications regarding interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs), pulmonary cysts, emphysema, pulmonary nodules, pleural plaques, normal spectrum of the thymus, and anterior mediastinal masses, concluding with the discussion of future directions of FHS CT cohorts studies in the era of radiomics and artificial intelligence.", "At the beginning of the artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) era, the expectations are high, and experts foresee that AI/ML shows potential for diagnosing, managing and treating a wide variety of medical conditions. However, the obstacles for implementation of AI/ML in daily clinical practice are numerous, especially regarding the regulation of these technologies. Therefore, we provide an insight into the currently available AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms that have been approved by the US Food & Drugs Administration (FDA). We aimed to raise awareness of the importance of regulatory bodies, clearly stating whether a medical device is AI/ML based or not. Cross-checking and validating all approvals, we identified 64 AI/ML based, FDA approved medical devices and algorithms. Out of those, only 29 (45%) mentioned any AI/ML-related expressions in the official FDA announcement. The majority (85.9%) was approved by the FDA with a 510(k) clearance, while 8 (12.5%) received de novo pathway clearance and one (1.6%) premarket approval (PMA) clearance. Most of these technologies, notably 30 (46.9%), 16 (25.0%), and 10 (15.6%) were developed for the fields of Radiology, Cardiology and Internal Medicine/General Practice respectively. We have launched the first comprehensive and open access database of strictly AI/ML-based medical technologies that have been approved by the FDA. The database will be constantly updated.", "Disease and treatment contribute to cognitive late effects following pediatric low-grade glioma (LGG). We analyzed prospectively collected neuropsychological data of German pediatric LGG survivors and focused on the impact of hydrocephalus at diagnosis, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) status, and extent of surgery.\nWe used the Neuropsychological Basic Diagnostic screening tool based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model for intelligence and the concept of cross-battery assessment at 2 and 5 years from diagnosis for 316 patients from the German pediatric LGG study and LGG registry (7.1 years median age; 45 NF1; cerebral hemispheres 16%, supratentorial midline 39%, infratentorial 45%). Hydrocephalus was classified radiologically in 137 non-NF1 patients with infratentorial tumors (95/137 complete/subtotal resection).\nPatients with NF1 versus non-NF1 exhibited inferior verbal short-term memory and visual processing (P < .001-.021). In non-NF1 patients, infratentorial tumor site and complete/subtotal resection were associated with sequelae in visual processing, psychomotor speed, and processing speed (P < .001-.008). Non-NF1 patients without surgical tumor reduction and/or nonsurgical treatment experienced similar deficits. Degree of hydrocephalus at diagnosis had no further impact. Psychomotor and processing speed were impaired comparably following chemo-/radiotherapy (P < .001-.021). Pretreatment factors such as NF1 or tumor site were relevant at multivariate analysis.\nAll pediatric LGG survivors are at risk to experience long-term cognitive impairments in various domains. Even surgical only management of cerebellar LGG or no treatment at all, that is, biopsy only/radiological diagnosis did not protect cognitive function. Since pattern and extent of deficits are crucial to tailor rehabilitation, neuropsychological and quality of survival assessments should be mandatory in future LGG trials.", "Background Neurocognitive impairment is a common complication of congenital heart disease (CHD) as well as acquired cardiovascular disease. Data are limited on neurocognitive function in adults with CHD (ACHD). Methods and Results A total of 1020 individuals with mild-to-moderate ACHD and 497\u00a0987 individuals without ACHD from the volunteer-based UK Biobank study underwent neurocognitive tests for fluid intelligence, reaction time, numeric memory, symbol-digit substitution, and trail making at enrollment and follow-up. Performance scores were compared before and after exclusion of preexisting stroke or coronary artery disease as measures of cerebro- and cardiovascular disease. Individuals with ACHD had significantly poorer performance on alpha-numeric trail making, a measure of visual attention and cognitive flexibility, spending 6.4\u00a0seconds longer on alpha-numeric trail making (95% CI, 3.0-9.9\u00a0seconds, P=0.002) and 2.5\u00a0seconds longer on numeric trail making (95% CI, 0.5-4.6\u00a0seconds, P=0.034), a measure of visual attention and processing speed. The ACHD cohort had modestly lower performance on symbol-digit substitution, a measure of processing speed, with 0.9 fewer correct substitutions (95% CI,\u00a0-\u00a01.5 to\u00a0-\u00a00.2 substitutions, P=0.021). After excluding preexisting stroke or coronary artery disease, individuals with ACHD continued to show poorer performance in all 6 domains (P=NS). Conclusions Individuals with mild-to-moderate ACHD had poorer neurocognitive performance, most significantly in tests of cognitive flexibility, analogous to deficits in children with CHD. These differences appear to be driven by increased burden of cerebro- and cardiovascular disease among individuals with ACHD.", "Autism is a frequent, precocious behavioral constellation of social and communicative atypicalities associated with apparently restricted interests and repetitive behavior and paired with an uneven ability profile. Its definition has constantly broadened in the past 75 years, introducing phenotypes increasingly distant from its initial description, heterogeneous in intelligence and speech level, and associated conditions. When it is unassociated with other conditions, its origin is mostly genetic, transmissible, and favored by frequent polymorphisms with small effects present in the general population. Identified de novo rare mutations with large deleterious effects produce phenotypes only loosely related to nonsyndromic autism. Autism is associated with brain reorganization at multiple levels, and with a variant of typical information processing, i.e., the way humans perceive, memorize, manipulate, and attribute emotional value to available information. Its phenotype evolves over the span of life, with an overall reduction of autistic signs, but it still requires some level of support. There is no treatment for this condition; however, it is compatible with high levels of integration into society.", "Improving hypertension management is still one of the biggest challenges in public health worldwide. Existing guidelines do not reach a consensus on the optimal Blood Pressure (BP) target. Therefore, how to effectively manage hypertension based on individual characteristics of patients, combined with the pharmacological and non-pharmacological approach, has become a problem to be urgently considered.\nReports published in PubMed that covered Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Approaches in subjects taking hypertension management were reviewed by the group independently and collectively. Practical recommendations for hypertension management were established by the panel.\nPharmacological mechanism, action characteristics, and main adverse reactions varied across different pharmacological agents, and patients with hypertension often require a combination of antihypertensive medications to achieve the target BP range. Non-pharmacological treatment provides an additional effective method for improving therapy adherence and long-term BP control, thus reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and slowing down the progression of the disease.\nThis review summarizes the available literature on the most convincing guideline principles, pharmacological treatment, biotechnology interference, interventional surgical treatment, managing hypertension with technical means of big data, Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Intervention, as well as providing future directions, for facilitating Current and Developing knowledge into clinical implementation.", "Human exposure to air pollution is a major public health concern. Environmental policymakers have been implementing various strategies to reduce exposure, including the 10th-day-no-driving system. To assess exposure of an entire population of a community in a highly polluted area, pollutant concentrations in microenvironments and population time-activity patterns are required. To date, population exposure to air pollutants has been assessed using air monitoring data from fixed atmospheric monitoring stations, atmospheric dispersion modeling, or spatial interpolation techniques for pollutant concentrations. This is coupled with census data, administrative registers, and data on the patterns of the time-based activities at the individual scale. Recent technologies such as sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT), communications technology, and artificial intelligence enable the accurate evaluation of air pollution exposure for a population in an environmental health context. In this study, the latest trends in published papers on the assessment of population exposure to air pollution were reviewed. Subsequently, this study proposes a methodology that will enable policymakers to develop an environmental health surveillance system that evaluates the distribution of air pollution exposure for a population within a target area and establish countermeasures based on advanced exposure assessment.", "Specific learning disorder (SLD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder frequently seen in childhood with deficits in many areas of functioning. Although the etiology of SLD is known to be multifactorial, research findings are limited. In this study, we aimed to compare the serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in children with SLD to healthy children to find out whether BDNF has a role in the pathophysiology of SLD.\nThe study included 30 children between the ages of 7-12, diagnosed with SLD and 30 age and gender matched healthy controls. The groups were tested on the Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Interview Schedule for School-age Children-Now and Lifetime Form (K-SADS-PL), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-revised form (WISC-R), the Teacher Information Form (TIF) and the Specific Learning Difficulty Battery (SLDB).\nNo difference the serum BDNF levels in children with SLD and the healthy controls. BDNF levels did not correlate with the WISC-R scores and reading rate in the SLD group.\nAn association was not determined between SLD and and serum BDNF levels. Our study was the first to investigate this relationship and provided preliminary data on this topic. There is a need for further studies with large patient groups of phenotypic homogeneity.", "Previous work has found that the Breakfast Task (BT), a computerized, ecologically informed executive ability measure, is sensitive to group differences in aging, acquired brain injury, and Parkinson's disease. We investigated whether this measure improves the prediction of functional status over and above standard measures of general intellectual ability, relationship perception, life skills, and symptom severity in individuals with schizophrenia. Regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the joint and incremental validity of the BT in predicting functional disability scores on the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS 2.0). Analyses with combined patient (n\u2009=\u200925) and control (n\u2009=\u200932) participants showed that participant status (patients versus control) was the only significant predictor of functional outcome. However, in the patient data, the proportion of variance accounted for improved significantly (model R2 of 4% vs. 25%) when BT scores were added to a model containing clinical (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), social (Relationships Across Domains), intellectual (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence), and life skills (Canadian Objective Assessment of Life Skills) measures. Results suggest that the BT, a tool that captures complex executive functioning, improves the prediction of disability in patients with schizophrenia and has potential assessment applications.", "A self-learning artificial intelligence system for an autonomous molecular search was recently utilized in place of laborious material development processes by humans. In this approach, because the evaluation of unsuitable or unrealistic candidates considerably decreases the search efficiency, prior knowledge of the chemistry and engineering requirements should be embedded into the molecular-generative algorithm. However, when using naive rule-based restrictions, one must implement the complex rule logic into the code each time, depending on the materials and potential applications. Herein, we propose a molecular-generative method using a maze game to control the allowable constituent fragments of molecules, which improves the flexibility and consistency to implement the rules. We performed an autonomous search for optimized cation structures of high Li-ion conductive ionic liquids evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations, in its practically reasonable scope defined by the maze game. From the search, we discover that acyl ammonium cations are favorable for high Li-ion conductivity because of the high association between the cations and Li ions. These results broaden our existing insight owing to the ability to explore beyond our practical experiences.", "The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) method was used to identify the regional brain activity deficits of self-limited focal epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (SLFECS) relative to normal controls (NCs).\nA total of 21 SLFECS (10 females, 11 males; mean age, 8.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0years) and 21 status-matched (age, sex, and education) NCs (10 females, 11 males; mean age, 8.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.19\u00a0years) were recruited. The fALFF method was applied to identify SLFECS-related regional brain alterations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to identify the ability of these regional brain areas in distinguishing the SLFECS group from the NCs group. The relationships between the regional brain activity deficits and clinical features were evaluated by Pearson's correlation analysis.\nSelf-limited focal epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes was associated with widespread regional brain activity alterations, including left cuneus with higher fALFF values, and bilateral striatum, bilateral precentral gyrus, ventral and dorsal pathway of sensory area, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left Rolandic area with lower fALFF values. ROC curve revealed excellent AUC value (0.964) of these areas in distinguishing the SLFECS group from the NCs group with high degree of sensitivity (90.5%) and specificity (95.2%). Intelligence quotient score positively correlated with the fALFF value in the left striatum (r\u00a0=\u00a00.453, p\u00a0=\u00a00.039).\nThe fALFF parameter could be served as a potential biomarker to identify the SLFECS-related regional brain deficits in the sensorimotor cortex and their pathways, which may be the etiology of paresthesia in SLFECS.", "Mobile health (m-health) is the term of monitoring the health using mobile phones and patient monitoring devices etc. It has been often deemed as the substantial breakthrough in technology in this modern era. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics have been applied within the m-health for providing an effective healthcare system. Various types of data such as electronic health records (EHRs), medical images, and complicated text which are diversified, poorly interpreted, and extensively unorganized have been used in the modern medical research. This is an important reason for the cause of various unorganized and unstructured datasets due to emergence of mobile applications along with the healthcare systems. In this paper, a systematic review is carried out on application of AI and the big data analytics to improve the m-health system. Various AI-based algorithms and frameworks of big data with respect to the source of data, techniques used, and the area of application are also discussed. This paper explores the applications of AI and big data analytics for providing insights to the users and enabling them to plan, using the resources especially for the specific challenges in m-health, and proposes a model based on the AI and big data analytics for m-health. Findings of this paper will guide the development of techniques using the combination of AI and the big data as source for handling m-health data more effectively.", "Differentiating between ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) using endoscopy is challenging. We aimed to realize automatic differential diagnosis among these diseases through machine learning algorithms.\nA total of 6399 consecutive patients (5128 UC, 875 CD and 396 ITB) who had undergone colonoscopy examinations in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2008 to November 2018 were enrolled. The input was the description of the endoscopic image in the form of free text. Word segmentation and key word filtering were conducted as data preprocessing. Random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches were applied to different disease entities. Three two-class classifiers (UC and CD, UC and ITB, and CD and ITB) and a three-class classifier (UC, CD and ITB) were built.\nThe classifiers built in this research performed well, and the CNN had better performance in general. The RF sensitivities/specificities of UC-CD, UC-ITB, and CD-ITB were 0.89/0.84, 0.83/0.82, and 0.72/0.77, respectively, while the values for the CNN of CD-ITB were 0.90/0.77. The precisions/recalls of UC-CD-ITB when employing RF were 0.97/0.97, 0.65/0.53, and 0.68/0.76, respectively, and when employing the CNN were 0.99/0.97, 0.87/0.83, and 0.52/0.81, respectively.\nClassifiers built by RF and CNN approaches had excellent performance when classifying UC with CD or ITB. For the differentiation of CD and ITB, high specificity and sensitivity were achieved as well. Artificial intelligence through machine learning is very promising in helping unexperienced endoscopists differentiate inflammatory intestinal diseases.\nThe abstract of this article has won the first prize of the Young Investigator Award during the Asian Pacific Digestive Week (APDW) 2019 held in Kolkata, India.", "This chapter explores the history of the developmental sciences and their impact on the study of neurodevelopmental and cognitive disabilities from the start of the 20th century to the present day. It covers the origins of intelligence testing and developmental schedules and the importance of early laboratory testing on identifying the causes of developmental differences. It also explores the importance of major legal and institutional changes after the Second World War in reframing approaches to developmental conditions. Postwar attempts to limit institutional care and to improve educational services had a significant influence on the growth of the cognitive science movement and genetic studies in the 1960s. The chapter argues that this history is critical to understanding contemporary approaches to neurodevelopmental science. Historical investigation demonstrates the complex ways that technological, social, and political changes can directly impact medical and scientific practice. It can therefore play an important role in informing those practices in the present.", "Traditionally, abnormal heart sound classification is framed as a three-stage process. The first stage involves segmenting the phonocardiogram to detect fundamental heart sounds; after which features are extracted and classification is performed. Some researchers in the field argue the segmentation step is an unwanted computational burden, whereas others embrace it as a prior step to feature extraction. When comparing accuracies achieved by studies that have segmented heart sounds before analysis with those who have overlooked that step, the question of whether to segment heart sounds before feature extraction is still open. In this study, we explicitly examine the importance of heart sound segmentation as a prior step for heart sound classification, and then seek to apply the obtained insights to propose a robust classifier for abnormal heart sound detection. Furthermore, recognizing the pressing need for explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the medical domain, we also unveil hidden representations learned by the classifier using model interpretation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the segmentation which can be learned by the model plays an essential role in abnormal heart sound classification. Our new classifier is also shown to be robust, stable and most importantly, explainable, with an accuracy of almost 100% on the widely used PhysioNet dataset.", "In the context that leadership matters and that leadership competencies differ from those needed to practice medicine or conduct research, developing leadership competencies for physicians is important. Indeed, effective leadership is needed ubiquitously in health care, both at the executive level and at the bedside (eg, leading clinical teams and problem-solving on the ward). Various leadership models have been proposed, most converging on common attributes, like envisioning a new and better future state, inspiring others around this shared vision, empowering others to effect the vision, modeling the expected behaviors, and engaging others by appealing to shared values. Attention to creating an organizational culture that is informed by the seven classic virtues (trust, compassion, courage, justice, wisdom, temperance, and hope) can also unleash discretionary effort in the organization to achieve high performance. Health care-specific leadership competencies include: technical expertise, not only in one's clinical/scientific arena to garner colleagues' respect but also regarding operations; strategic thinking; finance; human resources; and information technology. Also, knowledge of the regulatory and legislative environments of health care is critical, as is being a problem-solver and lifelong learner. Perhaps most important to leadership in health care, as in all sectors, is having emotional intelligence. A spectrum of leadership styles has been described, and effective leaders are facile in deploying each style in a situationally appropriate way. Overall, leadership competencies can be developed, and leadership development programs are signature features of leading health-care organizations.", "To explore the cross-level relationships between group organisational citizenship behaviour, emotional intelligence, work engagement and nurse-patient relationship.\nGroup-level factors influencing nurse-patient relationship are seldom studied.\nA cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among 1,246 nurses from 55 nursing groups in a 3A hospital in China, and the data were analysed by multilevel analysis.\nGroup organisational citizenship behaviour is positively related to nurse-patient relationship with work engagement as a mediator. Emotional intelligence moderates the relationship between group organisational citizenship behaviour and nurse-patient relationship. Specifically, high emotional intelligence reduces the positive impact of group organisational citizenship behaviour on nurse-patient relationship.\nThis study provides new insights into the influencing factors of nurse-patient relationship based on the social information processing theory. In groups with high group organisational citizenship, positive work engagement and emotional intelligence, nurses are more likely to deliver better performance in patient care, leading to better nurse-patient relationships.\nThis study suggests that influencing factors at both group and individual levels should be considered while establishing nurse-patient relationships. A positive group climate and personal ability development significantly improve patient care quality.", "This study longitudinally characterized the developmental status, growth, and body composition of children who were fed human milk (breastfed, BF), cow's milk-based (MF), or soy protein-based (SF) infant formula from 3 to 12 months.\nStandardized anthropometrics and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were used to characterize growth and body composition at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months (NCT00616395). Preschool Language Scale-3, Children's Memory Scale Index (CMS), and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence were administered at age 72 months. Mixed-effects models adjusting for gestational age, birth weight, child race and sex, parental education, and maternal IQ were performed.\nBody Mass index (BMI) was significantly lower between 24 and 72 months in BF children compared to SF children. At 3 and 6 months, BF infants had significantly higher fat mass (FM) than SF infants, whereas BF children had significantly lower FM at 36 and 48 months than SF children. Delayed Recognition Index of the CMS was higher for SF than for MF participants (p\u2009=\u20090.009). There was no other significant difference in developmental outcomes between groups.\nIn conclusion, BF, MF, and SF support adequate growth and development up to age 6 years.\nAlthough soy protein-based infant formula is reported to support normal infant growth and development compared to cow's milk-based formula and human milk, there are limited data on the effect of these feeding methods in school-aged children. This study suggests a significant difference in body composition, specifically BMI, after 24 months between infant feeding methods during the first year of life and in early childhood; however, all diets provide adequate nutrients to maintain normal development up to 72 months.", "Two studies examined factors that would influence people's preferences for interaction with a perpetrator of sexism. In Study 1 (n = 348), participants preferred to interact (being friends or developing a relationship) with an intelligent person regardless of whether or not that person was sexist. Study 2 (n = 614) replicated this finding and confirmed that where a perpetrator had a high level of intelligence, people were more willing to interact with them, regardless of the perpetrator's sex and the perceived commission or non-commission of sexist behavior. Moreover, Study 2 provides evidence that participants' hostile sexism beliefs are a significant covariate of a willingness to interact with unintelligent women. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the understanding of person perception.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape pharmaceutical formulation development through its ability to analyze and continuously monitor large datasets. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) three-dimensional printing (3DP) has made significant advancements in the field of oral drug delivery with personalized drug-loaded formulations being designed, developed and dispensed for the needs of the patient. The FDM 3DP process begins with the production of drug-loaded filaments by hot melt extrusion (HME), followed by the printing of a drug product using a FDM 3D printer. However, the optimization of the fabrication parameters is a time-consuming, empirical trial approach, requiring expert knowledge. Here, M3DISEEN, a web-based pharmaceutical software, was developed to accelerate FDM 3D printing using AI machine learning techniques (MLTs). In total, 614 drug-loaded formulations were designed from a comprehensive list of 145 different pharmaceutical excipients, 3D printed and assessed in-house. To build the predictive tool, a dataset was constructed and models were trained and tested at a ratio of 75:25. Significantly, the AI models predicted key fabrication parameters with accuracies of 76% and 67% for the printability and the filament characteristics, respectively. Furthermore, the AI models predicted the HME and FDM processing temperatures with a mean absolute error of 8.9\u00a0\u00b0C and 8.3\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Strikingly, the AI models achieved high levels of accuracy by solely inputting the pharmaceutical excipient trade names. Therefore, AI provides an effective holistic modeling technology and software to streamline and advance 3DP as a significant technology within drug development. M3DISEEN is available at (http://m3diseen.com/predictions/).", "About nine months after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this special issue of the Biomedical Journal takes stock of its evolution into a pandemic. We acquire an elaborate overview of the history and virology of SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiology of COVID-19, and the development of therapies and vaccines, based on useful tools such as a pseudovirus system, artificial intelligence, and repurposing of existing drugs. Moreover, we learn about a potential link between COVID-19 and oral health, and some of the strategies that allowed Taiwan to handle the outbreak exceptionally well, including a COVID-19 biobank establishment, online tools for contact tracing, and the efficient management of emergency departments.", "This article presents the geometrical-fractal text-tree model of speech and writing, the development of which is part of a project with the long-term goal to answer the question whether Artificial Intelligence and the corresponding human intelligence are principally different or not. Text-tree models consist of word-shrubs 'glued' together by syntax. Word-shrubs are designed by means of two principles, one is the dictionary or semantic principle that we can explain all verbal meanings by the meanings of other words. The other is the initiator-generator procedure, used to develop geometrical fractals. The structure of the word-shrub grows from the root-word when the meaning of the root-word, the generator, is connected as a branch to the root-word which is first initiator. Then all generator words are redefined as new initiators and connected to their meaning, the second generators. But the words or these are redefined as new initiators, each then being connected to its generator-meaning. This is repeated ad infinitum. Each new layer of generators represents a branching level. Consistency of verbal meaning is achieved by fixing the number of branching levels of the word-shrub. Wobbling consistency occurs when the talking or writing person shifts between levels of branching. We develop the M-method, important for most of the results, because it allows differences in verbal meaning to be estimated numerically. An interesting property of the text-tree model is revealed by showing that there must exist a cloud of unexperienced meaning variants of human texts. Most interesting, perhaps, is the demonstration of what we call the lemma of incompleteness which states that humans cannot prove beyond doubt, that they understand correctly what they say and write. This lemma seems to be a distant barrier for the expansion of human understanding and of relevance for understanding human versus artificial intelligence.", "This work presents the development and implementation of a distributed navigation system based on object recognition algorithms. The main goal is to introduce advanced algorithms for image processing and artificial intelligence techniques for teaching control of mobile robots. The autonomous system consists of a wheeled mobile robot with an integrated color camera. The robot navigates through a laboratory scenario where the track and several traffic signals must be detected and recognized by using the images acquired with its on-board camera. The images are sent to a computer server that performs a computer vision algorithm to recognize the objects. The computer calculates the corresponding speeds of the robot according to the object detected. The speeds are sent back to the robot, which acts to carry out the corresponding manoeuvre. Three different algorithms have been tested in simulation and a practical mobile robot laboratory. The results show an average of 84% success rate for object recognition in experiments with the real mobile robot platform.", "A myriad of cellular pathophysiological responses are mediated by polymodal ion channels that respond to chemical and physical stimuli such as thermoTRP channels. Intriguingly, these channels are pivotal therapeutic targets with limited clinical pharmacology. In silico methods offer an unprecedented opportunity for discovering new lead compounds targeting thermoTRP channels with improved pharmacological activity and therapeutic index.\nThis article reviews the progress on thermoTRP channel pharmacology because of (i) advances in solving their atomic structure using cryo-electron microscopy and, (ii) progress on computational techniques including homology modeling, molecular docking, virtual screening, molecular dynamics, ADME/Tox and artificial intelligence. Together, they have increased the number of lead compounds with clinical potential to treat a variety of pathologies. We used original and review articles from Pubmed (1997-2020), as well as the clinicaltrials.gov database, containing the terms thermoTRP, artificial intelligence, docking, and molecular dynamics.\nThe atomic structure of thermoTRP channels along with computational methods constitute a realistic first line strategy for designing drug candidates with improved pharmacology and clinical translation. In silico approaches can also help predict potential side-effects that can limit clinical development of drug candidates. Together, they should provide drug candidates with upgraded therapeutic properties.", "Immunosuppressive treatment strategies for autoimmune diseases have changed drastically with the development of targeted therapies. While targeted therapies have changed the way we manage immune mediated diseases, their use has been attended by a variety of infectious complications-some expected, others unexpected. This perspective examines lessons learned from the use of different targeted therapies over the past several decades, and reviews existing strategies to minimize infectious risk. Several of these infectious complications were predictable in the light of preclinical models and early clinical trials (i.e., tuberculosis and TNF inhibitors; meningococcus; and eculizumab). While these scenarios can potentially help us in terms of enhancing our predictive powers (higher vigilance, earlier detection, and risk mitigation), targeted therapies have also revealed unpredictable toxicities (i.e., natalizumab and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Severe infectious complications, even if rare, can derail a promising therapeutic and highlight the need for increased awareness and meticulous adjudication. Tools are available to help mitigate infectious risks. The first step is to ensure that infection safety is adequately studied at every level of drug development prior to regulatory approval, with adequate post-marketing surveillance including registries that collect real-world adverse events in a collaborative effort. The second step is to identify high risk patients (using risk calculators such as the RABBIT risk score; big data analyses; artificial intelligence). Finally, the most underutilized interventions to prevent severe infections in patients receiving targeted therapies across the spectrum of immune mediated inflammatory diseases are vaccinations.", "As high-throughput approaches in biological and biomedical research are transforming the life sciences into information-driven disciplines, modern analytics platforms for big data have started to address the needs for efficient and systematic data analysis and interpretation. We observe that radiobiology is following this general trend, with -omics information providing unparalleled depth into the biomolecular mechanisms of radiation response-defined as systems radiobiology. We outline the design of computational frameworks and discuss the analysis of big data in low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) responses of the mammalian brain. Following successful examples and best practices of approaches for the analysis of big data in life sciences and health care, we present the needs and requirements for radiation research. Our goal is to raise awareness for the radiobiology community about the new technological possibilities that can capture complex information and execute data analytics on a large scale. The production of large data sets from genome-wide experiments (quantity) and the complexity of radiation research with multidimensional experimental designs (quality) will necessitate the adoption of latest information technologies. The main objective was to translate research results into applied clinical and epidemiological practice and understand the responses of biological tissues to LDIR to define new radiation protection policies. We envisage a future where multidisciplinary teams include data scientists, artificial intelligence experts, DevOps engineers, and of course radiation experts to fulfill the augmented needs of the radiobiology community, accelerate research, and devise new strategies.", "The computed tomography angiography (CTA) postprocessing manually recognized by technologists is extremely labor intensive and error prone. We propose an artificial intelligence reconstruction system supported by an optimized physiological anatomical-based 3D convolutional neural network that can automatically achieve CTA reconstruction in healthcare services. This system is trained and tested with 18,766 head and neck CTA scans from 5 tertiary hospitals in China collected between June 2017 and November 2018. The overall reconstruction accuracy of the independent testing dataset is 0.931. It is clinically applicable due to its consistency with manually processed images, which achieves a qualification rate of 92.1%. This system reduces the time consumed from 14.22\u2009\u00b1\u20093.64\u2009min to 4.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u2009min, the number of clicks from 115.87\u2009\u00b1\u200925.9 to 4 and the labor force from 3 to 1 technologist after five months application. Thus, the system facilitates clinical workflows and provides an opportunity for clinical technologists to improve humanistic patient care.", "The respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that produces a large number of simultaneous patients with severe symptoms and in need of special hospital care, overloading the infrastructure of health services. All of these demands generate the need to ration equipment and interventions. Faced with this imbalance, how, when, and who decides, there is the impact of the stressful systems of professionals who are at the front line of care and, in the background, issues inherent to human subjectivity. Along this path, the idea of using artificial intelligence algorithms to replace health professionals in the decision-making process also arises. In this context, there is the ethical question of how to manage the demands produced by the pandemic. The objective of this work is to reflect, from the point of view of medical ethics, on the basic principles of the choices made by the health teams, during the COVID-19 pandemic, whose resources are scarce and decisions cause anguish and restlessness. The ethical values for the rationing of health resources in an epidemic must converge to some proposals based on fundamental values such as maximizing the benefits produced by scarce resources, treating people equally, promoting and recommending instrumental values, giving priority to critical situations. Naturally, different judgments will occur in different circumstances, but transparency is essential to ensure public trust. In this way, it is possible to develop prioritization guidelines using well-defined values and ethical recommendations to achieve fair resource allocation.", "The tremendous and rapid technological advances that humans have achieved in the last decade have definitely impacted how surgical tasks are performed in the operating room (OR). As a high-tech work environment, the contemporary OR has incorporated novel computational systems into the clinical workflow, aiming to optimize processes and support the surgical team. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly important for surgical decision making to help address diverse sources of information, such as patient risk factors, anatomy, disease natural history, patient values and cost, and assist surgeons and patients to make better predictions regarding the consequences of surgical decisions. In this review, we discuss the current initiatives that are using AI in cardiothoracic surgery and surgical care in general. We also address the future of AI and how high-tech ORs will leverage human-machine teaming to optimize performance and enhance patient safety.", "Over the past decade, people everywhere have become as dependent on the virtual world for their daily activities as they are dependent on the physical world for human activities. Global fiber optic networks have enabled communication in an unprecedented manner, connecting people in unique ways, propelling global supply chains, and giving consumers access to a variety of data from around the world. The online world is threatened by interstate rivals that engage in influence operations, economic espionage, and intelligence gathering and criminal groups that steal identities, ransom data, and grow their enterprises. Insiders facilitate intrusions wittingly and unwittingly raising the importance of corporations' roles in cybersecurity. This convergence between the virtual and physical worlds with the government and the corporate upends the entire frame of reference for national security, which is tilted toward physical attack and strict jurisdictional lines. As cybersecurity integrates further into U.S. national security, a new approach is needed to incorporate a human security construct at the user level. This article is adapted from their forthcoming book, Security in the Cyber Age from Georgetown University Press. The views expressed are their own.", "Echocardiography is a unique diagnostic tool for intraoperative monitoring and assessment of patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, there are high levels of interoperator variations in echocardiography interpretations that could lead to inaccurate diagnosis and incorrect treatment. Furthermore, anesthesiologists are faced with the additional challenge to interpret echocardiography and make decisions in a limited timeframe from these complex data. The need for an automated, less operator-dependent process that enhances speed and accuracy of echocardiography analysis is crucial for anesthesiologists. Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in the medical field and could help anesthesiologists analyze complex echocardiographic data while adding increased accuracy and consistency to interpretation. This review aims to summarize practical use of artificial intelligence in echocardiography and discusses potential limitations and challenges in the future for anesthesiologists.", "The present study is one of the first to analyze the predictive capacity of both trait and ability Emotional Intelligence (EI) based on the Mayer and Salovey model, in relation to tobacco use in a sample of Spanish adolescents. In this study, 799 students between the ages of 12 and 16 participated. A self-report on trait EI, an EI peak performance test, and questions about habits relating to tobacco use were administered. This cross-sectional study developed a quantitative and correlation-type methodology. The main results of the regression analyses, once the sex and age of the participants were controlled, revealed negative associations between the factors of clarity and emotional repair of the trait EI with respect to the variables of tobacco use, and a positive association was found for them and emotional attention. By comparison, with respect to ability EI, emotional perception and understanding were inversely related to adolescent tobacco use. These results underscore the importance of EI skills as protective factors against early initiation and subsequent tobacco abuse.", "The ability to accurately judge others' personality and the ability to accurately recognize others' emotions are both part of the broader construct of interpersonal accuracy (IPA). However, little research has examined the association between these two IPA domains. Little is also known about the relationship between personality judgment accuracy and other socio-emotional skills and traits. In the present study, 121 participants judged eight traits (Big Five, intelligence, cooperativeness, and empathy) in each of 30 targets who were presented either in a photograph, a muted video, or a video with sound. The videos were 30 second excerpts from negotiations that the targets had engaged in. Participants also completed standard tests of emotion recognition ability, emotion understanding, and trait emotional intelligence. Results showed that personality judgment accuracy, when indexed as trait accuracy and distinctive profile accuracy, positively correlated with emotion recognition ability and was unrelated to emotion understanding and trait emotional intelligence. Female participants were more accurate in judging targets' personality than men. These results provide support for IPA as a set of correlated domain-specific skills and encourage further research on personality judgment accuracy as a meaningful individual difference variable.", "Emotional intelligence (EI) has become widely appreciated as an important leadership attribute, in business, education and, increasingly, in health care. Defined as \"the capacity to understand your own and others' emotions and to motivate and develop yourself and others in service of improved work performance and enhanced organizational effectiveness,\" EI is correlated with a number of success attributes in several sectors; for example, in business, with enhanced business performance and enhanced personal career success, and in health care, with enhanced patient satisfaction, lower burnout, lower litigation risk, and enhanced leadership success. While multiple models of EI have evolved, perhaps the most popular model is framed around four general rubrics with component competencies. The general rubrics are: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. EI can be measured by using available instruments, and it can be learned and taught. Indeed, teaching EI has become increasingly common in health-care organizations in service of improving health care and health-care leadership. Although more research is needed, ample evidence supports the notion that EI is a critical success element for success as a health-care leader, especially because EI competencies differ markedly from the clinical and scientific skills that are core to being a clinician and/or investigator. This review of EI presents evidence in support of the relevance of EI to health care and health-care leadership, discusses how and when EI can be developed among health-care providers, and considers remaining questions.", "Natural products have been the main sources of new drugs. The different strategies have been developed to find the new drugs based on natural products. The traditional and ethic medicines have provided information on the therapeutic effects and resulted in some notable drug discovery of natural products. The special activities of the medicine plants such as the side effects have inspired scientists to develop the novel small molecular. The microorganisms and the endogenous active substances from human or animal also become the important approaches to the drug discovery. The tremendous progress in technology led to the new strategies in drug discovery from natural products. The bioinformation and artificial intelligence have facilitated the research and development of natural products. We will provide a scene of strategies and technologies for drug discovery from natural products in this review.", "Growth mindset is a motivation theory proposed by Carol Dweck that posits our beliefs about intelligence, and the ability to change mindsets can have impacts on how we approach challenges, respond to criticism challenges and orient our goals. This study characterised articles on growth mindset theory in health professions education to: summarise the aspects of growth mindset being researched, describe the discussed benefits of growth mindset theory and outline strategies discussed that may promote a growth mindset.\nA systematic review of the literature yielded 4927 articles-articles were reviewed and excluded if they were outside of health professions education and did not discuss Dweck's growth mindset theory. The final review yielded 14 research articles and 13 commentaries, which were characterised and analysed using content analysis.\nThe included articles were published in 2016 and beyond; the articles represented a diverse context, participant type and approach. Most research studies measured participant mindsets and evaluated the correlation with other variables (eg grit, well-being, anxiety). Articles often highlighted benefits and strategies to promote a growth mindset at the learner, educator and organisation level. The most common learner benefits were to help them be more receptive to feedback as well as increased resiliency and perseverance, educator benefits focused on supporting collaborative relationships and safe learning environments. The most prevalent strategies discussed were teaching learners about growth mindset theory, shifting faculty feedback to emphasise effort and to prioritise feedback across the organisation.\nThe growth mindset framework has been shown in other fields to help others manage educational challenges and enhance learning environments. Researchers are encouraged to explore how interventions such as teaching about and prioritising a growth mindset can support learners, health care professionals, educators and organisations.", "The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) previously developed a research database consisting of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants that were awarded to its members. The purpose of this report is to classify these NIH grants into various medical physics subdisciplines and analyze the scope of AAPM member research.\nFor this report, an algorithm classified grant topics into medical physics research subdisciplines (grants from 2002 to 2019 were analyzed). This algorithm utilized a search for common words and phrases within grant titles, keywords, abstracts, and activity codes to perform the classification. AAPM member grants were compared with non-AAPM member grants in various relevant subcategories to assess what percentage of these grants was held by AAPM members.\nThe percentage of AAPM member grants that included words relating to both imaging and therapy (image-guided therapy grants) increased from 13% (27/207) in 2002 to 27% (79/293) in 2019. The percentage of AAPM member grants utilizing words relating to artificial intelligence increased from 8% in 2002 to 20% in 2019. From 2002 to 2019, AAPM member grants referenced cancer more than all other diseases combined. The majority of AAPM member grants included words relating to clinical research (81% of grants in 2002 and 99% in 2019). When comparing AAPM member with non-AAPM member grants it was found that in 2019 AAPM members held a substantial fraction of all NIH grants that referenced stereotactic radiation therapies (41%), radionuclide therapies (10%), brachytherapies (35%), intensity-modulated radiation therapies (45%), and external beam particle therapies (55%). From 2002 to 2019, the percentage of AAPM membership holding NIH grants decreased for males (3.2% down to 2.3%) and increased for females (0.8% up to 1.3%) CONCLUSIONS: The majority of grants awarded to AAPM members focus on clinical research, which underlies the translational aspect of medical physics and suggests medical physicists are uniquely positioned to help translate new technologies such as artificial intelligence into the clinic. Since 2002, NIH grants awarded to AAPM members have increasingly referenced some form of image-guided therapy, suggesting opportunities for continued innovation of imaging technologies. A substantial fraction of all radiotherapy-related research grants were awarded to AAPM members, emphasizing the important role physicists have in developing radiotherapy-related treatments.", "With the increase of the need to use more sustainable processes for the industry in our society, the modeling of enzymes has become crucial to fully comprehend their mechanism of action and use this knowledge to enhance and design their properties. A lot of methods to study enzymes computationally exist and they have been classified on sequence-based, structure-based, and the more new artificial intelligence-based ones. Albeit the abundance of methods to help predict the function of an enzyme, molecular modeling is crucial when trying to understand the enzyme mechanism, as they aim to correlate atomistic information with experimental data. Among them, methods that simulate the system dynamics at a molecular mechanics level of theory (classical force fields) have shown to offer a comprehensive study. In this book chapter, we will analyze these techniques, emphasizing the importance of precise modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions. In the end, a brief explanation of the transference of the information from research studies to the industry is given accompanied with two examples of family enzymes where their modeling has helped their exploitation.", "The digitization of manufacturing industry has led to leaner and more efficient production, under the Industry 4.0 concept. Nowadays, datasets collected from shop floor assets and information technology (IT) systems are used in data-driven analytics efforts to support more informed business intelligence decisions. However, these results are currently only used in isolated and dispersed parts of the production process. At the same time, full integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in all parts of manufacturing systems is currently lacking. In this context, the goal of this manuscript is to present a more holistic integration of AI by promoting collaboration. To this end, collaboration is understood as a multi-dimensional conceptual term that covers all important enablers for AI adoption in manufacturing contexts and is promoted in terms of business intelligence optimization, human-in-the-loop and secure federation across manufacturing sites. To address these challenges, the proposed architectural approach builds on three technical pillars: (1) components that extend the functionality of the existing layers in the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0; (2) definition of new layers for collaboration by means of human-in-the-loop and federation; (3) security concerns with AI-powered mechanisms. In addition, system implementation aspects are discussed and potential applications in industrial environments, as well as business impacts, are presented.", "The aim of this study was to review the top 100 most-cited articles in ophthalmology in Asia since 1970.\nThe Scopus database was used to identify the top 100 most-cited ophthalmology articles published in ophthalmology (T100-Eye) and nonophthalmology (T100-General) journals.\nThe T100-Eye articles were published between 1982 and 2015, and T100-General from 1982 to 2017. T100-Eye had higher citations [median (range) = 317 (249-1326)] than T100-General [158 (105-2628)], but T100-General were published in journals with higher impact factor (IF) than T100-Eye (median IF=\u200a5.5 vs 4.4) and produced more landmark papers (3 vs 1 articles that were cited >1000 times). Fifty-five % of T100-Eye were published in 3 journals: Ophthalmology (n = 22), Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science (n\u200a=\u200a17), and American Journal of Ophthalmology (n\u200a=\u200a16). T100-Eye had 88 original research articles and 12 reviews, whereas T100-General had 84 original research and 16 reviews. The most-frequent studied disease categories were myopia (n\u200a=\u200a16) and age-related macular degeneration (n\u200a=\u200a15) in T100-Eye and diabetic retinopathy (n\u200a=\u200a24) and glaucoma (n\u200a=\u200a16) in T100-General. Japan and Singapore contributed most to T100-Eye (n\u200a=\u200a42, n\u200a=\u200a17) and T100-General (n\u200a=\u200a36, n\u200a=\u200a26) articles. More than 80% and 95% of first and last authors were male in both lists. Emerging research topics were optical coherence tomography in T100-Eye and artificial intelligence in T100-General.\nOur citation analysis reveals differences in the focus of research topics of top-cited ophthalmology articles published in ophthalmology and nonophthalmology journals in Asia. It highlights that certain eye diseases are studied more in Asia and shows the contribution of specific countries to highly cited publications in ophthalmology research in Asia.", "At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in China. The high potential of human-to-human transmission led to subsequent COVID-19 global pandemic. Public health strategies including reduced social contact and lockdown have been adopted in many countries. Nonetheless, social distancing and isolation could also represent risk factors for mental disorders, resulting in loneliness, reduced social support and under-detection of mental health needs. Along with this, social distancing determines a relevant obstacle for direct access to psychiatric care services. The pandemic generates the urgent need for integrating technology into innovative models of mental healthcare.\nIn this paper, we discuss the potential role of telepsychiatry (TP) and other cutting-edge technologies in the management of mental health assistance. We narratively review the literature to examine the advantages and risks related to the extensive application of these new therapeutic settings, along with the possible limitations and ethical concerns.\nTelemental health services may be particularly feasible and appropriate for the support of patients, family members and healthcare providers during this COVID-19 pandemic. The integration of TP with other technological innovations (eg, mobile apps, virtual reality, big data and artificial intelligence (AI)) opens up interesting future perspectives for the improvement of mental health assistance.\nTelepsychiatry is a promising and growing way to deliver mental health services but is still underused. The COVID-19 pandemic may serve as an opportunity to introduce and promote, among numerous mental health professionals, the knowledge of the possibilities offered by the digital era.", "The game of curling can be considered a good test bed for studying the interaction between artificial intelligence systems and the real world. In curling, the environmental characteristics change at every moment, and every throw has an impact on the outcome of the match. Furthermore, there is no time for relearning during a curling match due to the timing rules of the game. Here, we report a curling robot that can achieve human-level performance in the game of curling using an adaptive deep reinforcement learning framework. Our proposed adaptation framework extends standard deep reinforcement learning using temporal features, which learn to compensate for the uncertainties and nonstationarities that are an unavoidable part of curling. Our curling robot, Curly, was able to win three of four official matches against expert human teams [top-ranked women's curling teams and Korea national wheelchair curling team (reserve team)]. These results indicate that the gap between physics-based simulators and the real world can be narrowed.", "The integration of machine learning algorithms in decision support tools for physicians is gaining popularity. These tools can tackle the disparities in healthcare access as the technology can be implemented on smartphones. We present the first, large-scale study on patients with skin of colour, in which the feasibility of a novel mobile health application (mHealth app) was\u00a0investigated in actual clinical workflows.\nTo develop a mHealth app to diagnose 40 common skin diseases and test it in clinical settings.\nA convolutional neural network-based algorithm was trained with clinical images of 40 skin diseases. A smartphone app was generated and validated on 5014 patients, attending rural and urban outpatient dermatology departments in India. The results of this mHealth app were compared against the dermatologists' diagnoses.\nThe machine-learning model, in an in silico validation study, demonstrated an overall top-1 accuracy of 76.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.88% and mean area-under-curve of 0.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 on a set of clinical images. In the clinical study, on patients with skin of colour, the app achieved an overall top-1 accuracy of 75.07% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a073.75-76.36), top-3 accuracy of 89.62% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a088.67-90.52) and mean area-under-curve of 0.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07.\nThis study underscores the utility of artificial intelligence-driven smartphone applications as a point-of-care, clinical decision support tool for dermatological diagnosis for a wide spectrum of skin diseases in patients of the skin of colour.", "Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) are exposed to multiple job-related stressors and therefore experience high levels of occupational stress and job burnout. In healthcare systems, job burnout from occupational stress may lead to poor patient care and safety outcomes. Prior research findings suggest nurses who reported higher levels of emotional intelligence (EI) had significantly lower work-related stress and less job burnout than nurses who reported lower levels of EI. To date, the relationship between EI and occupational stress among CRNAs has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between EI levels and workplace stress levels among CRNAs. A descriptive survey design was used to answer the research question. Findings from the study reveal a significant relationship between the levels of EI and levels of stress in the CRNA population surveyed (r = -0.20, P = .01). CRNAs who reported higher levels of EI experienced less workplace stress than CRNAs who reported lower levels of EI. Additional findings suggest that CRNAs who have higher levels of EI are better able to cope with occupational stressors. Developing and implementing strategies to increase EI among CRNAs may be key to decreasing work-related stress and burnout.", "His-bundle pacing (HBP) has emerged as an alternative to conventional ventricular pacing because of its ability to deliver physiological ventricular activation. Pacing at the His bundle produces different electrocardiographic (ECG) responses: selective His-bundle pacing (S-HBP), non-selective His bundle pacing (NS-HBP), and myocardium-only capture (MOC). These 3 capture types must be distinguished from each other, which can be challenging and time-consuming even for experts.\nThe purpose of this study was to use artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of supervised machine learning using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automate HBP ECG interpretation.\nWe identified patients who had undergone HBP and extracted raw 12-lead ECG data during S-HBP, NS-HBP, and MOC. A CNN was trained, using 3-fold cross-validation, on 75% of the segmented QRS complexes labeled with their capture type. The remaining 25% was kept aside as a testing dataset.\nThe CNN was trained with 1297 QRS complexes from 59 patients. Cohen kappa for the neural network's performance on the 17-patient testing set was 0.59 (95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.88; P <.0001), with an overall accuracy of 75%. The CNN's accuracy in the 17-patient testing set was 67% for S-HBP, 71% for NS-HBP, and 84% for MOC.\nWe demonstrated proof of concept that a neural network can be trained to automate discrimination between HBP ECG responses. When a larger dataset is trained to higher accuracy, automated AI ECG analysis could facilitate HBP implantation and follow-up and prevent complications resulting from incorrect HBP ECG analysis.", "COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted face-to-face teaching in medical schools globally. The use of remote learning as an emergency measure has affected students, faculty, support staff, and administrators. The aim of this narrative review paper is to examine the challenges and opportunities faced by medical schools in implementing remote learning for basic science teaching in response to the COVID-19 crisis. We searched relevant literature in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using specific keywords, e.g., \"COVID-19 pandemic,\" \"preclinical medical education,\" \"online learning,\" \"remote learning,\" \"challenges,\" and \"opportunities.\" The pandemic has posed several challenges to premedical education (e.g., suspension of face-to-face teaching, lack of cadaveric dissections, and practical/laboratory sessions) but has provided many opportunities as well, such as the incorporation of online learning in the curriculum and upskilling and reskilling in new technologies. To date, many medical schools have successfully transitioned their educational environment to emergency remote teaching and assessments. During COVID-19 crisis, the preclinical phase of medical curricula has successfully introduced the novel culture of \"online home learning\" using technology-oriented innovations, which may extend to post-COVID era to maintain teaching and learning in medical education. However, the lack of hands-on training in the preclinical years may have serious implications on the training of the current cohort of students, and they may struggle later in the clinical years. The use of emergent technology (e.g., artificial intelligence for adaptive learning, virtual simulation, and telehealth) for education is most likely to be indispensable components of the transformative change and post-COVID medical education.", "Polysomnography is the gold standard in identifying sleep stages; however, there are discrepancies in how technicians use the standards. Because organizing meetings to evaluate this discrepancy and/or reach a consensus among multiple sleep centers is time-consuming, we developed an artificial intelligence system to efficiently evaluate the reliability and consistency of sleep scoring and hence the sleep center quality.\nAn interpretable machine learning algorithm was used to evaluate the interrater reliability (IRR) of sleep stage annotation among sleep centers. The artificial intelligence system was trained to learn raters from 1 hospital and was applied to patients from the same or other hospitals. The results were compared with the experts' annotation to determine IRR. Intracenter and intercenter assessments were conducted on 679 patients without sleep apnea from 6 sleep centers in Taiwan. Centers with potential quality issues were identified by the estimated IRR.\nIn the intracenter assessment, the median accuracy ranged from 80.3%-83.3%, with the exception of 1 hospital, which had an accuracy of 72.3%. In the intercenter assessment, the median accuracy ranged from 75.7%-83.3% when the 1 hospital was excluded from testing and training. The performance of the proposed method was higher for the N2, awake, and REM sleep stages than for the N1 and N3 stages. The significant IRR discrepancy of the 1 hospital suggested a quality issue. This quality issue was confirmed by the physicians in charge of the 1 hospital.\nThe proposed artificial intelligence system proved effective in assessing IRR and hence the sleep center quality.", "Plants teem with microorganisms, whose tremendous diversity and role in plant-microbe interactions are being increasingly explored. Microbial communities create a functional bond with their hosts and express beneficial traits capable of enhancing plant performance. Therefore, a significant task of microbiome research has been identifying novel beneficial microbial traits that can contribute to crop productivity, particularly under adverse environmental conditions. However, although knowledge has exponentially accumulated in recent years, few novel methods regarding the process of designing inoculants for agriculture have been presented. A recently introduced approach is the use of synthetic microbial communities (SynComs), which involves applying concepts from both microbial ecology and genetics to design inoculants. Here, we discuss how to translate this rationale for delivering stable and effective inoculants for agriculture by tailoring SynComs with microorganisms possessing traits for robust colonization, prevalence throughout plant development and specific beneficial functions for plants. Computational methods, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, will leverage the approaches of screening and identifying beneficial microbes while improving the process of determining the best combination of microbes for a desired plant phenotype. We focus on recent advances that deepen our knowledge of plant-microbe interactions and critically discuss the prospect of using microbes to create SynComs capable of enhancing crop resiliency against stressful conditions.", "Recently, the rate of the production and renewal of information makes it almost impossible to be updated. It is quite difficult to process and interpret large amounts of data by human beings. Unlimited memory capacities, learning abilities, artificial intelligence (AI) applications, and robotic surgery techniques cause orthopedic surgeons to be concerned about losing their jobs. The idea of AI, which was first introduced in 1956, has evolved over time by revealing deep learning and evolutionary plexus that can mimic the human neuron cell. Image processing is the leading improvement in developed algorithms. Theoretically, these algorithms appear to be quite successful in interpreting medical images and orthopedic decision support systems for preoperative evaluation. Robotic surgeons have emerged as significant competitors in carrying out the taken decisions. The first robotic applications of orthopedic surgery started in 1992 with the ROBODOC system. Applications started with hip arthroplasty continued with knee arthroplasty. Publications indicate that problems such as blood loss and infection caused by the long operation time in the early stages have been overcome in time with the help of learning systems. Comparative studies conducted with humans indicate that robots are better than humans in providing limb lengthening, patient satisfaction, and cost. As in all new technologies, the developments in both AI applications and robotics surgery indicate that technology is in favor in terms of cost/benefit analyses. Although studies indicate that new technologies are more successful than humans, the replacement of technology with experience and long-term results with traditional methods will not be observed in the near future.", "A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to achieve fast and accurate artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis of early gastric cancer (GC) and other gastric lesions based on endoscopic images.\nA CNN-based diagnostic system based on a ResNet34 residual network structure and a DeepLabv3 structure was constructed and trained using 21,217 gastroendoscopic images of five gastric conditions, peptic ulcer (PU), early gastric cancer (EGC) and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN), advanced gastric cancer (AGC), gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs), and normal gastric mucosa without lesions. The trained CNN was evaluated using a test dataset of 1091 images. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the CNN were calculated. The CNN diagnosis was compared with those of 10 endoscopists with over 8\u00a0years of experience in endoscopic diagnosis.\nThe diagnostic specificity and PPV of the CNN were higher than that of the endoscopists for the EGC and HGIN images (specificity: 91.2% vs. 86.7%, by 4.5%, 95% CI 2.8-7.2%; PPV: 55.4% vs. 41.7%, by 13.7%, 95% CI 11.2-16.8%) and the diagnostic accuracy of the CNN was close to those of the endoscopists for the lesion-free, EGC and HGIN, PU, AGC, and SMTs images. The CNN had image recognition time of 42\u00a0s for all the test set images.\nThe constructed CNN system could be used as a rapid auxiliary diagnostic instrument to detect EGC and HGIN, as well as other gastric lesions, to reduce the workload of endoscopists.", "Inequities in social environments are likely associated with a large portion of racial disparities in childhood cognitive performance. Identification of the specific exposures associated with cognitive development is needed to inform prevention efforts.\nTo identify modifiable factors associated with childhood cognitive performance.\nThis longitudinal pregnancy cohort study included 1503 mother-child dyads who were enrolled in the University of Tennessee Health Science Center-Conditions Affecting Neurodevelopment and Learning in Early Life study between December 1, 2006, and July 31, 2011, and assessed annually until the children were aged 4 to 6 years. The analytic sample comprised 1055 mother-child dyads. A total of 155 prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal exposures were included to evaluate environment-wide associations. Participants comprised a community-based sample of pregnant women who were recruited between 16 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation from 4 hospitals in Shelby County, Tennessee. Women with high-risk pregnancies were excluded. Data were analyzed from June 1, 2018, to April 15, 2019.\nIndividual and neighborhood socioeconomic position, family structure, maternal mental health, nutrition, delivery complications, birth outcomes, and parenting behaviors.\nChild's full-scale IQ measured by the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, Fifth Edition, at age 4 to 6 years.\nOf 1055 children included in the analytic sample, 532 (50.4%) were female. Among mothers, the mean (SD) age was 26.0 (5.6) years; 676 mothers (64.1%) were Black, and 623 mothers (59.0%) had an educational level of high school or less. Twenty-four factors were retained in the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis and full models adjusted for potential confounding. Associations were noted between child cognitive performance and parental education and breastfeeding; for each increase of 1.0 SD in exposure, positive associations were found with cognitive growth fostering from observed parent-child interactions (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.12; 95% CI, 0.24-2.00) and maternal reading ability (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.42; 95% CI, 0.16-2.68), and negative associations were found with parenting stress (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-1.04; 95% CI, -1.86 to -0.21). A moderate increase in these beneficial exposures was associated with a notable improvement in estimated cognitive test scores using marginal means (0.5% of an SD). Black children experienced fewer beneficial cognitive performance exposures; in a model including all 24 exposures and covariates, no racial disparity was observed in cognitive performance (95% CIs for race included the null).\nThe prospective analysis identified multiple beneficial and modifiable cognitive performance exposures that were associated with mean differences in cognitive performance by race. The findings from this observational study may help guide experimental studies focused on reducing racial disparities in childhood cognitive performance.", "DNA damage is one of major culprits in many complex diseases; thus, there is great interest in the discovery of novel lead compounds regulating DNA damage. However, there remain plenty of challenges to evaluate DNA damage through counting the amount of intranuclear foci. Herein, a deep-learning-based open-source pipeline, FociNet, was developed to automatically segment full-field fluorescent images and dissect DNA damage of each cell. We annotated 6000 single-nucleus images to train the classification ability of the proposed computational pipeline. Results showed that FociNet achieved satisfying performance in classifying a single cell into a normal, damaged, or nonsignaling (no fusion-protein expression) state and exhibited excellent compatibility in the assessment of DNA damage based on fluorescent foci images from various imaging platforms. Furthermore, FociNet was employed to analyze a data set of over 5000 foci images from a high-content screening of 315 natural compounds from traditional Chinese medicine. It was successfully applied to identify several novel active compounds including evodiamine, isoliquiritigenin, and herbacetin, which were found to reduce 53BP1 foci for the first time. Among them, isoliquiritigenin from Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. exerts a significant effect on attenuating double strand breaks as indicated by the comet assay. In conclusion, this work provides an artificial intelligence tool to evaluate DNA damage on the basis of microscopy images as well as a potential strategy for high-content screening of active compounds.", "Healthcare workforce shortages are an international issue. This service development targets the contributory element of poor retention amongst newly qualified nurses. Resilience Based Clinical Supervision is underpinned by the principles of Compassion Focused Therapy. It aims to alleviate work related stress and support individuals to reframe their experiences through structured and reflective discussion. It incorporates skills which develop proficiency in mindfulness, distress tolerance and positive reframing.\nTo explore the acceptability, feasibility, and experience of Resilience Based Clinical Supervision to support transition to practice in newly qualified nurses.\nAn extensive program of champion (N\u00a0=\u00a040) and cascade (N\u00a0=\u00a078) training for facilitators was implemented as a development of their standard transition to practice package.\nSix pilot sites within the UK.\nNewly qualified nurses (266) received a minimum of six Resilience Based Clinical Supervision sessions over a one-year period.\nData were gathered via eleven focus groups (n\u00a0=\u00a048). A deductive and collaborative approach to content analysis was utilised to consider the perceived outcomes, challenges, experience and best practice amongst both facilitators and nurses' transitioning from student to registered practitioner.\nAnalysis showed the new registrants were extending and accepting compassion to and from their peers, signifying the compassionate flow within the group setting. This was continued through the development of self-care strategies utilised in practice, which allowed compassion to flow into patient care and towards colleagues.\nThe main perceived outcome of RBCS was recognised as restorative. However, the growth of skills for self-care, emotional intelligence, and confidence to challenge poor working conditions also indicated a developmental function. These perceived outcomes have the potential to result in positive implications for workforce retention. Importantly, findings draw attention to the importance of wider organisational commitment and structures which support and respond to RBCS facilitator and participant concerns.", "Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NSC) is associated with language deficits. Conventional tests, such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), may not reflect accurate long-term cognition. Alternatively, mismatch negativity (MMN) waves recorded via electroencephalogram (EEG) measure neural responses to speech and may objectively predict language development. This study aimed to (1) correlate infant MMN to future language achievement and (2) compare MMN among subtypes of NSC.\nPre and postoperatively (mean operative age 9.5 months), NSC participants received the BSID and EEG phoneme-discrimination paradigm(80\u200adB,250\u200aHz). The MMN was the largest negative amplitude in the difference wave 80 to 300 ms after stimuli. To measure cognitive outcome, patients completed a neurodevelopmental battery (Wechsler-Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and Wechsler-Fundamentals) at >6 years of age.\nEleven NSC patients with EEG testing in infancy were neurocognitively tested (average age 8.0 years; 27% female; 55% sagittal, 27% metopic, 9% unicoronal, 9% sagittal/metopic). The left frontal cluster MMN strongly correlated with word-reading (r\u200a=\u200a0.713, P\u200a=\u200a0.031), reading-comprehension (r\u200a=\u200a0.745, P\u200a=\u200a0.021), and language-composites (r\u200a=\u200a0.0771, P\u200a=\u200a0.015). Conversely, BSID scores did not yield significant predictive value (r\u200a<\u200a0.5, P\u200a>\u200a0.05). Follow-up event related potentials (ERP) comparison included 39 normal control, 18 sagittal, 17 metopic, 6 unilateral-coronal infants. Preoperatively, sagittal (P\u200a=\u200a0.003) and metopic (P\u200a=\u200a0.003) patients had attenuated left frontal MMN compared to controls. Postoperatively, the sagittal cohort was normalized to controls while metopic patients retained attenuations (P\u200a=\u200a0.041).\nERP assessment in NSC had significantly better predictive value for future neurocognition than the BSID. Preoperatively, sagittal and metopic patients had attenuated neural response to language; postoperatively, sagittal patients had improved responses in comparison to metopic patients. Use of ERP assessment may help tailor treatment for language deficits earlier in development.", "In accordance with guidelines, most patients with T1 colorectal cancers (CRC) undergo surgical resection with lymph node dissection, despite the low incidence (\u223c10%) of metastasis to lymph nodes. To reduce unnecessary surgical resections, we used artificial intelligence to build a model to identify T1 colorectal tumors at risk for metastasis to lymph node and validated the model in a separate set of patients.\nWe collected data from 3134 patients with T1 CRC treated at 6 hospitals in Japan from April 1997 through September 2017 (training cohort). We developed a machine-learning artificial neural network (ANN) using data on patients' age and sex, as well as tumor size, location, morphology, lymphatic and vascular invasion, and histologic grade. We then conducted the external validation on the ANN model using independent 939 patients at another hospital during the same period (validation cohort). We calculated areas under the receiver operator characteristics curves (AUCs) for the ability of the model and US guidelines to identify patients with lymph node metastases.\nLymph node metastases were found in 319 (10.2%) of 3134 patients in the training cohort and 79 (8.4%) of /939 patients in the validation cohort. In the validation cohort, the ANN model identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.83, whereas the guidelines identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.73 (P < .001). When the analysis was limited to patients with initial endoscopic resection (n\u00a0= 517), the ANN model identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.84 and the guidelines identified these patients with an AUC of 0.77 (P\u00a0= .005).\nThe ANN model outperformed guidelines in identifying patients with T1 CRCs who had lymph node metastases. This model might be used to determine which patients require additional surgery after endoscopic resection of T1 CRCs.

The use of multiple technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded systems, communication technologies, artificial intelligence, and smart devices can reduce the economic costs of the healthcare system. Different communication technologies have made it possible to provide personalized and remote health services. In order to respond to the needs of future intelligent e-health applications, we are called to develop intelligent healthcare systems and expand the number of applications connected to the network. Therefore, the 5G network should support intelligent healthcare applications, to meet some important requirements such as high bandwidth and high energy efficiency. This article presents an intelligent architecture for monitoring diabetic patients by using machine learning algorithms. The architecture elements included smart devices, sensors, and smartphones to collect measurements from the body. The intelligent system collected the data received from the patient, and performed data classification using machine learning in order to make a diagnosis. The proposed prediction system was evaluated by several machine learning algorithms, and the simulation results demonstrated that the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm gives superior classification accuracy, sensitivity, and precision compared to other algorithms.", "The rapid detection of ongoing outbreak - and the identification of causative pathogen - is pivotal for the early recognition of public health threats. The emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases are linked to several determinants, both human factors - such as population density, travel, and trade - and ecological factors - like climate change and agricultural practices. Several technologies are available for the rapid molecular identification of pathogens [e.g. real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)], and together with on line monitoring tools of infectious disease activity and behaviour, they contribute to the surveillance system for infectious diseases. Web-based surveillance tools, infectious diseases modelling and epidemic intelligence methods represent crucial components for timely outbreak detection and rapid risk assessment. The study aims to integrate the current prevention and control system with a prediction tool for infectious diseases, based on regression analysis, to support decision makers, health care workers, and first responders to quickly and properly recognise an outbreak. This study has the intention to develop an infectious disease regressive prediction tool working with an off-line database built with specific epidemiological parameters of a set of infectious diseases of high consequences. The tool has been developed as a first prototype of a software solution called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS) and it had been established in two main steps, the database building stage and the software implementation stage (MATLAB\u00ae environment). The IDS has been tested with the epidemiological data of three outbreaks occurred recently: severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in China (2002-2003), plague outbreak in Madagascar (2017) and the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2018). The outcomes are promising and they reveal that the software has been able to recognize and characterize these outbreaks. The future perspective about this software regards the developing of that tool as a useful and user-friendly predictive tool appropriate for first responders, health care workers, and public health decision makers to help them in predicting, assessing and contrasting outbreaks.", "The increasing accuracy of algorithms to predict values and preferences raises the possibility that artificial intelligence technology will be able to serve as a surrogate decision-maker for incapacitated patients. Following Camillo Lamanna and Lauren Byrne, we call this technology the autonomy algorithm (AA). Such an algorithm would mine medical research, health records, and social media data to predict patient treatment preferences. The possibility of developing the AA raises the ethical question of whether the AA or a relative ought to serve as surrogate decision-maker in cases where the patient has not issued a medical power of attorney. We argue that in such cases, and against the standard practice of vesting familial surrogates with decision making authority, the AA should have sole decision-making authority. This is because the AA will likely be better at predicting what treatment option the patient would have chosen. It would also be better at avoiding bias and, therefore, choosing in a more patient-centered manner. Furthermore, we argue that these considerations override any moral weight of the patient's special relationship with their relatives.", "Jean Piaget's theory is a central reference point in the study of normal development in children. He proposed in the 20th century that distinct stages occur in the development of intellectual abilities from the preoperational period (intuitive stage: 4-7 years old) to the second stage of conceptual intelligence. One of the most famous Piagetian tasks is number conservation. Failures and successes in this task reveal two fundamental stages in children's thinking and judgment, shifting at approximately 7 years of age from visuospatial intuition to logico-mathematical operation (i.e., number conservation). New emerging techniques in the 21st century, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, can support this preeminent theory with an understanding of the cerebral basis of the various stages. Since these new technologies are considered to be invasive in children, such techniques are subject to ethical views and concerns due to pediatric participants. The chapter discusses a brain imaging study on Piaget's conservation-of-number task, showing what can be accomplished through careful ethical considerations in the context of healthy children with normal cognitive development.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing research area in computer science that aims to mimic cognitive processes through a number of techniques. Supervised machine learning, a subfield of AI, includes methods that can identify patterns in high-dimensional data using labeled 'ground truth' data and apply these learnt patterns to analyze, interpret, or make predictions on new datasets. Supervised machine learning has become a significant area of interest within the medical community. Radiology and neuroradiology in particular are especially well suited for application of machine learning due to the vast amount of data that is generated. One devastating disease for which neuroimaging plays a significant role in the clinical management is stroke. Within this context, AI techniques can play pivotal roles for image-based diagnosis and management of stroke. This overview focuses on the recent advances of artificial intelligence methods - particularly supervised machine learning and deep learning - with respect to workflow, image acquisition and reconstruction, and image interpretation in patients with acute stroke, while also discussing potential pitfalls and future applications.", "An epidemic caused by COVID-19 in China turned into pandemic within a short duration affecting countries worldwide. Researchers and companies around the world are working on all the possible strategies to develop a curative or preventive strategy for the same, which includes vaccine development, drug repurposing, plasma therapy, and drug discovery based on Artificial intelligence. Therapeutic approaches based on Computational biology and Machine-learning algorithms are specially considered, with a view that these could provide a fast and accurate outcome in the present scenario. As an effort towards developing possible therapeutics for COVID-19, we have used machine-learning algorithms for the generation of alignment kernels from diverse viral sequences of Covid-19 reported from India, China, Italy and USA. Using these diverse sequences we have identified the conserved motifs and subsequently a peptide library was designed against them. Of these, 4 peptides have shown strong binding affinity against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) and also maintained their stability and specificity under physiological conditions as observed through MD Simulations. Our data suggest that these evolutionary peptides against COVID-19 if found effective may provide cross-protection against diverse Covid-19 variants.", "This study focuses on the role of bioethics in designing public healthcare policies towards elderly patients with cancer. The general overview of public administration and healthcare approach to treatment. Interpretation of how the EU public administration faces the challenges of an ageing population and extended human longevity. The significant emotional impact a genetic cancer test holds, both in the patients and their families, is to be explained. From the bioethics' perspective, artificial intelligence and transhumanism are dangerous concerning its absence of boundaries. As a result of daily contact with cancer, we acknowledge the immediate and relevant impact science produces in a patient's life. We converge these subjects to the improvement of public policies and governmental efforts in increasing society's positive results.", "An increasing number of automated and artificial intelligence (AI) systems make medical treatment recommendations, including personalized recommendations, which can deviate from standard care. Legal scholars argue that following such nonstandard treatment recommendations will increase liability in medical malpractice, undermining the use of potentially beneficial medical AI. \u202fHowever, such liability depends in part on lay judgments by jurors: when physicians use AI systems, in which circumstances would jurors hold physicians liable? Methods: To determine potential jurors' judgments of liability, we conducted an online experimental study of a nationally representative sample of 2,000 U.S. adults. Each participant read 1 of 4 scenarios in which an AI system provides a treatment recommendation to a physician. The scenarios varied the AI recommendation (standard or nonstandard care) and the physician's decision (to accept or reject that recommendation). Subsequently, the physician's decision caused harm. Participants then assessed the physician's liability. Results: Our results indicate that physicians who receive advice from an AI system to provide standard care can reduce the risk of liability by accepting, rather than rejecting, that advice, all else being equal. However, when an AI system recommends nonstandard care, there is no similar shielding effect of rejecting that advice and so providing standard care. Conclusion: The tort law system is unlikely to undermine the use of AI precision medicine tools and may even encourage the use of these tools.", "In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of an automated artificial intelligence-based diabetic retinopathy (DR) algorithm with two retinal imaging systems using two different technologies: a conventional flash fundus camera and a white LED confocal scanner.\nOn the same day, patients underwent dilated colour fundus photography using both a conventional flash fundus camera (TRC-NW8, Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and a fully automated white LED confocal scanner (Eidon, Centervue, Padova, Italy). All images were analysed for DR severity both by retina specialists and the AI software EyeArt (Eyenuk Inc., Los Angeles, CA) and graded as referable DR (RDR) or not RDR. Sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve (AUC) were computed.\nA series of 165 diabetic subjects (330 eyes) were enrolled. The automated algorithm achieved 90.8% sensitivity with 75.3% specificity on images acquired with the conventional fundus camera and 94.1% sensitivity with 86.8% specificity on images obtained from the white LED confocal scanner. The difference between AUC was 0.0737 (p\u2009=\u20090.0023).\nThe automated image analysis software is well suited to work with different imaging technologies. It achieved a better diagnostic performance when the white LED confocal scanner is used. Further evaluation in the context of screening campaigns is needed.", "To evaluate if adult persons with spina bifida (SB) who have urinary tract complications have cognitive difficulties that can be identified by neuropsychological tests.\nAll individuals with SB\u2009\u2265\u200918 years of age registered at a regional outpatient clinic (n\u2009=\u2009219) were invited, of which, 154 persons were included. Neuropsychological assessment of their cognitive status was performed with Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale\u00ae-Fourth Edition: Coding, Block design, Arithmetic's, FAS (word generation), Rey Auditory Verbal Test for learning, and delayed recall 30\u2009min. Bladder and bowel function were assessed with questions used by the Nordic Spinal Cord Injury Registry (NSCIR) in structured interviews, by questionnaires, and by chart reviews.\nAverage neuropsychological test results for this SB population was shown to be approximately 1\u2009SD under the median for the general population. The Coding test showed significantly lower test results as compared with the whole SB group in persons with urinary tract complications, especially urinary tract infections, reduced kidney function, dependent emptying of the bladder, and the bowel and accidental bowel leakage. The Arithmetic's test showed a significant difference between subgroups in all parameters except reduced kidney function whereas the other neuropsychological tests were significantly correlated with some but not all urological parameters.\nWe propose neuropsychological testing with primarily two tests to find those persons with SB who, due to cognitive challenges, might need extra support to minimize urological complications.", "Maternal ante- and postnatal anxiety have been associated with children's socio-emotional development. Moreover, maternal anxiety has been studied as both a contributing factor and consequence of preterm birth, and children born preterm are more likely to develop behavioural problems compared to term-born controls. This study investigated the association between maternal anxiety measured soon after birth and mental health in 215 ex-preterm children, born at <33 weeks, who participated in the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging Study. Children were followed-up at a median age of 4.6 years (range 4.2-6.6), and received behavioural and cognitive evaluation. Maternal trait anxiety was assessed with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index at term corrected age. Primary outcome measures were children's Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2) scores, indicative of generalised psychopathology and autism symptomatology, respectively. IQ was assessed with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence. The final sample, after excluding participants with missing data and multiple pregnancy (n\u00a0=\u00a075), consisted of 140 children (51.4% male). Results showed that increased maternal trait anxiety at term corrected age was associated with children's higher SDQ scores (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.41, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003, f2\u00a0=\u00a00.08) and SRS-2 scores (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.28, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03, f2\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Our findings indicate that children born preterm whose mothers are more anxious in the early postnatal period may show poorer mental health outcomes at pre-school age. Further research is needed to investigate preventative measures that can be offered to high-risk premature babies and their families.", "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive optical imaging method that can generate high-resolution en face and cross-sectional images of the skin in vivo to a maximum depth of 2\u00a0mm. While OCT holds considerable potential for noninvasive diagnosis and disease monitoring, it is poorly understood by many dermatologists. Here we aim to equip the practising dermatologist with an understanding of the principles of skin OCT and the potential clinical indications. We begin with an introduction to the technology and discuss the different modalities of OCT including angiographic (dynamic) OCT, which can image cutaneous blood vessels at high resolution. Next we review clinical applications. OCT has been most extensively investigated in the diagnosis of keratinocyte carcinomas, particularly basal cell carcinoma. To date, OCT has not proven sufficiently accurate for the robust diagnosis of malignant melanoma; however, the evaluation of abnormal vasculature with angiographic OCT is an area of active investigation. OCT, and in particular angiographic OCT, also shows promise in monitoring the response to therapy of inflammatory dermatoses, such as psoriasis and connective tissues disease. We additionally discuss a potential role for artificial intelligence in improving the accuracy of interpretation of OCT imaging data.", "The fusion oncoprotein Bcr-Abl is an aberrant tyrosine kinase responsible for chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The auto-inhibition regulatory module observed in the progenitor kinase c-Abl is lost in the aberrant Bcr-Abl, because of the lack of the N-myristoylated cap able to bind the myristoyl binding pocket also conserved in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain. A way to overcome the occurrence of resistance phenomena frequently observed for Bcr-Abl orthosteric drugs is the rational design of allosteric ligands approaching the so-called myristoyl binding pocket. The discovery of these allosteric inhibitors although very difficult and extremely challenging, represents a valuable option to minimize drug resistance, mostly due to the occurrence of mutations more frequently affecting orthosteric pockets, and to enhance target selectivity with lower off-target effects. In this perspective, we will elucidate at a molecular level the structural bases behind the Bcr-Abl allosteric control and will show how artificial intelligence can be effective to drive the automated de novo design towards off-patent regions of the chemical space.", "The Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula is the main treatment method of TCM. A formula often contains multiple herbs where core herbs play a critical therapeutic effect for treating diseases. It is of great significance to find out the core herbs in formulae for providing evidences and references for the clinical application of Chinese herbs and formulae. In this paper, we propose a core herb discovery model CHDSC based on semantic analysis and community detection to discover the core herbs for treating a certain disease from large-scale literature, which includes three stages: corpus construction, herb network establishment, and core herb discovery. In CHDSC, two artificial intelligence modules are used, where the Chinese word embedding algorithm ESSP2VEC is designed to analyse the semantics of herbs in Chinese literature based on the stroke, structure, and pinyin features of Chinese characters, and the label propagation-based algorithm LILPA is adopted to detect herb communities and core herbs in the herbal semantic network constructed from large-scale literature. To validate the proposed model, we choose chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) as an example, search 1126 articles about how to treat CGN in TCM from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and apply CHDSC to analyse the collected literature. Experimental results reveal that CHDSC discovers three major herb communities and eighteen core herbs for treating different CGN syndromes with high accuracy. The community size, degree, and closeness centrality distributions of the herb network are analysed to mine the laws of core herbs. As a result, we can observe that core herbs mainly exist in the communities with more than 25 herbs. The degree and closeness centrality of core herb nodes concentrate on the range of [15, 40] and [0.25, 0.45], respectively. Thus, semantic analysis and community detection are helpful for mining effective core herbs for treating a certain disease from large-scale literature.", "The world's aging population is increasing, with an expected increase in the prevalence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). Proper nutrition and good eating behavior show promise for preventing and slowing the progression of ADRD and consequently improving patients with ADRD's health status and quality of life. Most ADRD care is provided by informal caregivers, so assisting caregivers to manage patients with ADRD's diet is important.\nThis study aims to design, develop, and test an artificial intelligence-powered voice assistant to help informal caregivers manage the daily diet of patients with ADRD and learn food and nutrition-related knowledge.\nThe voice assistant is being implemented in several steps: construction of a comprehensive knowledge base with ontologies that define ADRD diet care and user profiles, and is extended with external knowledge graphs; management of conversation between users and the voice assistant; personalized ADRD diet services provided through a semantics-based knowledge graph search and reasoning engine; and system evaluation in use cases with additional qualitative evaluations.\nA prototype voice assistant was evaluated in the lab using various use cases. Preliminary qualitative test results demonstrate reasonable rates of dialogue success and recommendation correctness.\nThe voice assistant provides a natural, interactive interface for users, and it does not require the user to have a technical background, which may facilitate senior caregivers' use in their daily care tasks. This study suggests the feasibility of using the intelligent voice assistant to help caregivers manage patients with ADRD's diet.", "In December 2019, a novel virus named COVID-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. In early 2020, the COVID-19 virus spread in all continents of the world except Antarctica, causing widespread infections and deaths due to its contagious characteristics and no medically proven treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has been termed as the most consequential global crisis since the World Wars. The first line of defense against the COVID-19 spread are the non-pharmaceutical measures like social distancing and personal hygiene. The great pandemic affecting billions of lives economically and socially has motivated the scientific community to come up with solutions based on computer-aided digital technologies for diagnosis, prevention, and estimation of COVID-19. Some of these efforts focus on statistical and Artificial Intelligence-based analysis of the available data concerning COVID-19. All of these scientific efforts necessitate that the data brought to service for the analysis should be open source to promote the extension, validation, and collaboration of the work in the fight against the global pandemic. Our survey is motivated by the open source efforts that can be mainly categorized as (a) COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scans, X-ray images, and cough sounds, (b) COVID-19 case reporting, transmission estimation, and prognosis from epidemiological, demographic, and mobility data, (c) COVID-19 emotional and sentiment analysis from social media, and (d) knowledge-based discovery and semantic analysis from the collection of scholarly articles covering COVID-19. We survey and compare research works in these directions that are accompanied by open source data and code. Future research directions for data-driven COVID-19 research are also debated. We hope that the article will provide the scientific community with an initiative to start open source extensible and transparent research in the collective fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.", "We review evidence for Macphail's (1982, 1985, 1987) Null Hypothesis, that nonhumans animals do not differ either qualitatively or quantitatively in their cognitive capacities. Our review supports the Null Hypothesis in so much as there are no qualitative differences among nonhuman vertebrate animals, and any observed differences along the qualitative dimension can be attributed to failures to account for contextual variables. We argue species do differ quantitatively, however, and that the main difference in \"intelligence\" among animals lies in the degree to which one must account for contextual variables.", "Early diagnosis and dietary treatment do not prevent long-term complications, which mostly affect the central nervous system in classical galactosemia patients. The clinical outcome of patients is highly variable, and there is an urgent need for prognostic biomarkers. The aim of this study was first to increase knowledge on the natural history of classical galactosemia by studying a cohort of patients with varying geno- and phenotypes and second to study the association between clinical outcomes and two possible prognostic biomarkers. In addition, the association between abnormalities on brain MRI and clinical outcomes was investigated. Classical galactosemia patients visiting the galactosemia expertise outpatient clinic of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre were evaluated according to the International Classical Galactosemia guideline with the addition of an examination by a neurologist, serum immunoglobulin G N-glycan profiling and a brain MRI. The biomarkers of interest were galactose-1-phosphate levels and N-glycan profiles, and the clinical outcomes studied were intellectual outcome and the presence or absence of movement disorders and/or primary ovarian insufficiency. Data of 56 classical galactosemia patients are reported. The intellectual outcome ranged from 45 to 103 (mean 77\u2009\u00b1\u200914) and was <85 in 62%. Movement disorders were found in 17 (47%) of the 36 tested patients. In females aged 12 years and older, primary ovarian insufficiency was diagnosed in 12 (71%) of the 17 patients. Significant differences in N-glycan peaks were found between controls and patients. However, no significant differences in either N-glycans or galactose-1-phosphate levels were found between patients with a poor (intellectual outcome\u2009<\u200985) and normal intellectual outcome (intellectual outcome\u2009\u2265\u200985), and with or without movement disorders or primary ovarian insufficiency. The variant patients detected by newborn screening, with previously unknown geno- and phenotypes and currently no long-term complications, demonstrated significantly lower galactose-1-phospate levels than classical patients (P\u2009<\u20090.0005). Qualitative analysis of the MRI's demonstrated brain abnormalities in 18 of the 21 patients, more severely in patients with a lower intellectual outcome and/or with movement disorders. This study demonstrates a large variability in clinical outcome, which varies from a below average intelligence, movement disorders and in females primary ovarian insufficiency to a normal clinical outcome. In our cohort of classical galactosemia patients, galactose-1-phosphate levels and N-glycan variations were not associated with clinical outcomes, but galactose-1-phosphate levels did differentiate between classical and variant patients detected by newborn screening. The correlation between brain abnormalities and clinical outcome should be further investigated by quantitative analysis of the MR images. The variability in clinical outcome necessitates individual and standardized evaluation of all classical galactosemia patients.", "A microscopic analysis of tissue is the gold standard for cancer detection. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) for the reporting of prostate biopsy (PB) is conventionally based on fixation, processing, acquisition of glass slides, and analysis with an analog microscope by a local pathologist. Digitalization and real-time remote access to images could enhance the reporting process, and form the basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM), a novel optical technology, enables immediate digital image acquisition in an almost HE-like resolution without requiring conventional processing.\nThe aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic ability of FCM for prostate cancer (PCa) identification and grading from PB.\nThis is a prospective, comparative study evaluating FCM and HE for prostate tissue interpretation. PBs were performed (March to June 2019) at a single coordinating unit on consecutive patients with clinical and laboratory indications for assessment. FCM digital images (n\u2009=\u2009427) were acquired immediately from PBs (from 54 patients) and stored; corresponding glass slides (n\u2009=\u2009427) undergoing the conventional HE processing were digitalized and stored as well. A panel of four international pathologists with diverse background participated in the study and was asked to evaluate all images. The pathologists had no FCM expertise and were blinded to clinical data, HE interpretation, and each other's evaluation. All images, FCM and corresponding HE, were assessed for the presence or absence of cancer tissue and cancer grading, when appropriate. Reporting was gathered via a dedicated web platform.\nThe primary endpoint is to evaluate the ability of FCM to identify cancer tissue in PB cores (per-slice analysis). FCM outcomes are interpreted by agreement level with HE (K value). Additionally, either FCM or HE outcomes are assessed with interobserver agreement for cancer detection (presence vs absence of cancer) and for the discrimination between International Society of Urologic Pathologists (ISUP) grade\u2009=\u20091 and ISUP grade > 1 (secondary endpoint).\nOverall, 854 images were evaluated from each pathologist. PCa detection of FCM was almost perfectly aligned with HE final reports (95.1% of correct diagnosis with FCM, \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.84). Inter-rater agreement between pathologists was almost perfect for both HE and FCM for PCa detection (0.98 for HE, \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.95; 0.95 for FCM, \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.86); for cancer grade attribution, only a moderate agreement was reached for both HE and FCM (HE, \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.47; FCM, \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.49).\nFCM provides a microscopic, immediate, and seemingly reliable diagnosis for PCa. The real-time acquisition of digital images-without requiring conventional processing-offers opportunities for immediate sharing and reporting. FCM is a promising tool for improvements in cancer diagnostic pathways.\nFluorescence confocal microscopy may provide an immediate, microscopic, and apparently reliable diagnosis of prostate cancer on prostate biopsy, overcoming the standard turnaround time of conventional processing and interpretation.", "The agent paradigm and multi-agent systems are a perfect match for the design of smart cities because of some of their essential features such as decentralization, openness, and heterogeneity. However, these major advantages also come at a great cost. Since agents' mental states are hidden when the implementation is not known and available, intelligent services of smart cities cannot leverage information from them. We contribute with a proposal for the analysis and prediction of hidden agents' mental states in a multi-agent system using machine learning methods that learn from past agents' interactions. The approach employs agent communication languages, which is a core property of these multi-agent systems, to infer theories and models about agents' mental states that are not accessible in an open system. These mental state models can be used on their own or combined to build protocol models, allowing agents (and their developers) to predict future agents' behavior for various tasks such as testing and debugging them or making communications more efficient, which is essential in an ambient intelligence environment. This paper's main contribution is to explore the problem of building these agents' mental state models not from one, but from several interaction protocols, even when the protocols could have different purposes and provide distinct ambient intelligence services.", "COVID-19 was first discovered in December 2019 and has since evolved into a pandemic.\nTo address this global health crisis, artificial intelligence (AI) has been deployed at various levels of the health care system. However, AI has both potential benefits and limitations. We therefore conducted a review of AI applications for COVID-19.\nWe performed an extensive search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases for COVID-19-related English-language studies published between December 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. We supplemented the database search with reference list checks. A thematic analysis and narrative review of AI applications for COVID-19 was conducted.\nIn total, 11 papers were included for review. AI was applied to COVID-19 in four areas: diagnosis, public health, clinical decision making, and therapeutics. We identified several limitations including insufficient data, omission of multimodal methods of AI-based assessment, delay in realization of benefits, poor internal/external validation, inability to be used by laypersons, inability to be used in resource-poor settings, presence of ethical pitfalls, and presence of legal barriers. AI could potentially be explored in four other areas: surveillance, combination with big data, operation of other core clinical services, and management of patients with COVID-19.\nIn view of the continuing increase in the number of cases, and given that multiple waves of infections may occur, there is a need for effective methods to help control the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its shortcomings, AI holds the potential to greatly augment existing human efforts, which may otherwise be overwhelmed by high patient numbers.", "Genetic quality may be expressed through many traits simultaneously, and this would suggest a phenotype-wide fitness factor. In humans, intelligence has been positively associated with several potential indicators of genetic quality, including ejaculate quality. We conducted a conceptual replication of one such study by investigating the relationship between intelligence (assessed by the Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices Test-Short Form) and ejaculate quality (indexed by sperm count, sperm concentration, and sperm motility) in a sample of 41 men (ages ranging 18 to 33 years; M = 23.33; SD = 3.60). By self-report, participants had not had a vasectomy, and had never sought infertility treatment. We controlled for several covariates known to affect ejaculate quality (e.g., abstinence duration before providing an ejaculate) and found no statistically significant relationship between intelligence and ejaculate quality; our findings, therefore, do not match those of Arden, Gottfredson, Miller et al. or those of previous studies. We discuss limitations of this study and the general research area and highlight the need for future research in this area, especially the need for larger data sets to address questions around phenotypic quality and ejaculate quality.", "The inverse relationship between the cost of drug development and the successful integration of drugs into the market has resulted in the need for innovative solutions to overcome this burgeoning problem. This problem could be attributed to several factors, including the premature termination of clinical trials, regulatory factors, or decisions made in the earlier drug development processes. The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate and assist drug development has resulted in cheaper and more efficient processes, ultimately improving the success rates of clinical trials. This review aims to showcase and compare the different applications of AI technology that aid automation and improve success in drug development, particularly in novel drug target identification and design, drug repositioning, biomarker identification, and effective patient stratification, through exploration of different disease landscapes. In addition, it will also highlight how these technologies are translated into the clinic. This paradigm shift will lead to even greater advancements in the integration of AI in automating processes within drug development and discovery, enabling the probability and reality of attaining future precision and personalized medicine.", "The variability of bioparticles remains a key barrier to realizing the competent potential of nanoscale detection into a digital diagnosis of an extraneous object that causes an infectious disease. Here, we report label-free virus identification based on machine-learning classification. Single virus particles were detected using nanopores, and resistive-pulse waveforms were analyzed multilaterally using artificial intelligence. In the discrimination, over 99% accuracy for five different virus species was demonstrated. This advance is accessed through the classification of virus-derived ionic current signal patterns reflecting their intrinsic physical properties in a high-dimensional feature space. Moreover, consideration of viral similarity based on the accuracies indicates the contributing factors in the recognitions. The present findings offer the prospect of a novel surveillance system applicable to detection of multiple viruses including new strains.", "Aging is a multifactorial process, which affects the human body on every level and results in both biological and psychological changes. Multiple studies have demonstrated that a lower subjective age is associated with better mental and physical health, cognitive functions, well-being and satisfaction with life. In this work we propose a list of non-modifiable and modifiable factors that may possibly be influenced by subjective age and its changes across an individual's lifespan. These factors can be used for a future development of individual psychological aging clocks, which may be utilized as a sensitive measure for health status and overall life satisfaction. Furthermore, recent progress in artificial intelligence and biomarkers of biological aging have enabled scientists to discover and evaluate the efficacy of potential aging- and disease-modifying drugs and interventions. We propose that biomarkers of psychological age, which are just as important as those for biological age, may likewise be used for these purposes. Indeed, these two types of markers complement one another. We foresee the development of a broad range of parametric and deep psychological and biopsychological aging clocks, which may have implications for drug development and therapeutic interventions, and thus healthcare and other industries.", "To explore the stability of diagnosis and the relationship between behavioural, adaptive and developmental skills in early to middle childhood in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\nFifty-four children recruited to the study were diagnosed with ASD before 42\u2009months. Outcomes at follow-up after a mean interval of 64\u2009months were measured using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Vineland-II adaptive scale and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and parental survey data. Scores before school were compared with follow-up data through descriptive, correlational and multiple regression analyses.\nASD was confirmed in all children at follow-up (mean age 10\u2009years). Fifty-eight percent of children were enrolled in a supported educational class or school and 42% were taking a psychotropic medication. Adaptive function improved significantly in 19% of children. Developmental and adaptive behavioural scores before school correlated with cognitive, behaviour and adaptive assessments at follow-up.\nAt follow-up, the diagnosis was confirmed in all children. The children showed gains in their adaptive skills but and many required ongoing educational and behavioural support. Early developmental and adaptive assessments reliably predicted later educational support needs, cognitive and adaptive function and are a useful component of a diagnostic assessment.", "Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is considered a useful test for enhancing risk assessment in the primary prevention setting. Clinical trials are under consideration. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a multidisciplinary working group on August 26 to 27, 2019, in Bethesda, Maryland, to review available evidence and consider the appropriateness of conducting further research on coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing, or other coronary imaging studies, as a way of informing decisions for primary preventive treatments for cardiovascular disease. The working group concluded that additional evidence to support current guideline recommendations for use of CAC in middle-age adults is very likely to come from currently ongoing trials in that age group, and a new trial is not likely to be timely or cost effective. The current trials will not, however, address the role of CAC testing in younger adults or older adults, who are also not addressed in existing guidelines, nor will existing trials address the potential benefit of an opportunistic screening strategy made feasible by the application of artificial intelligence. Innovative trial designs for testing the value of CAC across the lifespan were strongly considered and represent important opportunities for additional research, particularly those that leverage existing trials or other real-world data streams including clinical computed tomography scans. Sex and racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, and inclusion of diverse participants in future CAC trials, particularly those based\u00a0in the United States, would enhance the potential impact of these studies.", "This follow-up study of 82 children investigated the potential impact of early and recent exposure to mercury and lead on their neurodevelopmental performance at 5-8 years of age (2017-2018). Early exposure of these children to mercury, methylmercury, and lead was assessed during lactation at 3-12 months old, as well as their mother's exposure using measurements from a cross-sectional study (2011-2013). Only infants who failed to pass the neurodevelopment screening tools and/or had elevated mercury were included in this study. Urine and hair were sampled during the follow-up study to assess the children's recent exposure to mercury, methylmercury, and lead. Their cognitive performance and visual-motor integration were also measured using the Test of Non-Verbal Intelligence (TONI) and the Beery-Visual-Motor Integration (Beery VMI), respectively. The association between alterations in urinary porphyrins excretion and exposure to metals was analyzed and their influence on the children's neurodevelopment was explored. Linear regression models revealed a significant negative association between the infants' mercury exposure during lactation and the TONI Quotient (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.298, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a0-4.677, -0.414) and Beery VMI Age Equivalent scores at age 5-8 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.437, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a0-6.383, -1.844). The mothers' blood methylmercury was inversely and significantly associated with their children's TONI Quotient (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.231, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a0-8.184, -0.331). In contrast, the children's Beery VMI Age Equivalent scores were positively and significantly associated with the hair methylmercury of the mothers (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.214, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.088, 3.899) and their infants (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.256, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.396, 4.488). These relationships suggest the presence of negative confounding that we did not take into account. Unlike mercury, there was some evidence that lead in breast milk had an inverse relationship with the children's visual-motor coordination skills. Our study did not show a clear association between children's recent exposure to metals and neurodevelopment. However, a significant inverse association was observed between the TONI Quotient and the interaction of hair methylmercury\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\u2211porphyrins (\u00df\u00a0=\u00a0-0.224, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a0-0.86, -0.049), implying that porphyrins are a sensitive measure of low body-mercury burden. Although lead induced higher \u2211porphyrins excretion in urine (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.347, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.107, 0.525), their interaction did not influence children's neurodevelopmental scores. The interactions between metals and porphyrins might provide insights into their potential contributory role in the pathogenesis associated with neurological disorders or other diseases. Despite the small sample size of the present study, its findings about the association between toxic metal exposure and the high risk of poor neurodevelopmental performance are worrying, particularly at an early age, and additional research is needed using larger sample sizes.", "The presence of heterogeneity/subgroups in infants and older populations against single-domain brain or behavioral measures has been previously characterized. However, few attempts have been made to explore heterogeneity at the brain-behavior relationship level. Such a hypothesis posits that different subgroups of infants may possess qualitatively different brain-behavior relationships that could ultimately contribute to divergent developmental outcomes even with relatively similar brain phenotypes. In this study, we aimed to explore such relationship-level heterogeneity and delineate the subgrouping structure of newborns with differential brain-behavior associations based on a typically developing sample of 81 infants with 3-week resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans and 4-year intelligence quotient (IQ) measures. Our results not only confirmed the existence of relationship-level heterogeneity in newborns but also revealed divergent developmental outcomes associated with two subgroups showing similar brain functional connectivity but contrasting brain-behavior relationships. Importantly, further analyses unveiled an intriguing pattern that the subgroup with higher 4-year IQ outcomes possessed brain-behavior relationships that were congruent to their functional connectivity pattern in neonates while the subgroup with lower 4-year IQ not, providing potential explanations for the observed IQ differences. The characterization of heterogeneity at the brain-behavior relationship level may not only improve our understanding of the patterned intersubject variability during infancy but could also pave the way for future development of heterogeneity-inspired, personalized, subgroup-specific models for better prediction.", "Purpose People who stutter are susceptible to discrimination, stemming from negative stereotypes and social misattributions. There has been a recent push to evaluate the underlying explicit and implicit cognitive mechanisms associated with social judgments, moving away from only evaluating explicit social bias about people who stutter. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate how listeners change their implicit and explicit social (mis)attributions after hearing a people who stutter produce disfluent speech. Method The current project was an adaptation of the Byrd et al. (2017) study to evaluate listener implicit/explicit social judgments of stuttered speech across five categories (i.e., confidence, friendliness, intelligence, distractibility, and extroversion) before and after a stuttering self-disclosure. This was done by implementing a modified version of the Ferguson et al. (2019) computer mouse-tracking paradigm. Results Consistent with previous findings, participants made more explicit positive social judgments of confidence, friendliness, extroversion, and intelligence after a stuttering self-disclosure, but the distractedness category was resistant to change. Also consistent with previous findings, participants experienced a higher degree of cognitive competition (i.e., higher area under the curve) shortly after self-disclosure, which lessened over time. Conclusions Explicit and implicit biases exist, but self-disclosure significantly impacts the cognitive system of listeners. Specifically, self-disclosure may reduce explicit bias through experience and explicit belief updating, but when cognitive heuristics are strong, implicit bias may be slower to change.", "Artificial intelligence applications can very powerful in areas of speech recognition, image processing and identification, medical diagnosis and clustering to name a few. There is a perception that developing your own artificial intelligence (AI) application can be a daunting task, requiring in-depth knowledge and programming skills. This is not entirely true since many desktop and laptop systems have computing power that can accommodate machine- and deeplearning development, the available options for code development and a broad support base. A generic guide in developing a platform for AI project development is presented.", "Early studies on long-term functional recovery after motor and premotor lesions showed better outcomes in younger monkeys than in older monkeys. This finding led to the widespread belief that brain injuries cause less impairment in children than adults. However, this view has limitations and a large body of evidence now indicates that cerebral damages can be more harmful when inflicted at young age, during critical periods of neural development. To date, this issue has been mainly investigated in the context of focal and diffuse cortical lesions. Much less is known about the potential influence of early cerebellar damages. Several studies exist in survivor of posterior fossa tumours. However, in these studies, critical confounders were not always considered and contradictory conclusions were provided. We studied the impact or early cerebellar damage on long-term functional recovery in three groups of 15 posterior fossa survivors, comparable with respect to their tumour characteristics (type, size and location) but operated at different ages: young (\u22647\u2009years), middle (>7 and \u226413\u2009years) and older (>13\u2009years). Daily (health-related quality of life scale, performance status scale), motor (International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, Pegboard Purdue Test) and cognitive (full-scale intelligence quotient) functioning were assessed. A general linear model controlling for age at surgery, radiotherapy, preservation of deep cerebellar nuclei, tumour volume and delay between surgery and assessment was used to investigate significant variations in outcome measures. Early age at surgery, lesion of deep cerebellar nuclei and postoperative radiotherapy had a significant, independent negative influence on long-term recovery. Tumour volume and delay between surgery and assessment had no statistically detectable impact. The negative influence of early age at surgery was significant in all domains: daily functioning (health-related quality of life scale, performance status scale), motor functioning (International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, Pegboard Purdue Test) and cognitive functioning (full-scale intelligence quotient). These results support the existence of an early critical period of development during which the cerebellar 'learning machine' is of critical importance. Although the extent to which the early deficits here observed can be reversed needs now to be established, our data plead for the implementation of prompt and intense rehabilitation interventions in children operated before 7\u2009years of age.", "In the last decades increasingly more systems of artificial intelligence have been established in medicine, which identify diseases or pathologies or discriminate them from complimentary diseases. Up to now the Corvis\u00aeST (Corneal Visualization Scheimpflug Technology, Corvis\u00aeST, Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany) yielded a\u00a0binary index for classifying keratoconus but did not enable staging. The purpose of this study was to develop a\u00a0prediction model, which mimics the topographic keratoconus classification index (TKC) of the Pentacam high resolution (HR, Oculus) with measurement parameters extracted from the Corvis\u00aeST.\nIn this study 60\u00a0measurements from normal subjects (TKC\u00a00) and 379\u00a0eyes with keratoconus (TKC\u00a01-4) were recruited. After measurement with the Pentacam HR (target parameter TKC) a\u00a0measurement with the Corvis\u00aeST device was performed. From this device 6\u00a0dynamic response parameters were extracted, which were included in the Corvis biomechanical index (CBI) provided by the Corvis\u00aeST (ARTh, SP-A1, DA ratio 1\u202fmm, DA ratio 2\u202fmm, A1 velocity, max. deformation amplitude). In addition to the TKC as the target, the binarized TKC (1: TKC\u00a01-4, 0: TKC\u00a00) was modelled. The performance of the model was validated with accuracy as an indicator for correct classification made by the algorithm. Misclassifications in the modelling were penalized by the number of stages of deviation between the modelled and measured TKC values.\nA total of 24\u00a0different models of supervised machine learning from 6\u00a0different families were tested. For modelling of the TKC stages\u00a00-4, the algorithm based on a\u00a0support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel showed the best performance with an accuracy of 65.1% correct classifications. For modelling of binarized TKC, a\u00a0decision tree with a\u00a0coarse resolution showed a\u00a0superior performance with an accuracy of 95.2% correct classifications followed by the SVM with linear or quadratic kernel and a\u00a0nearest neighborhood classifier with cubic kernel (94.5% each).\nThis study aimed to show the principle of supervised machine learning applied to a\u00a0set-up for the modelled classification of keratoconus staging. Preprocessed measurement data extracted from the Corvis\u00aeST device were used to mimic the TKC provided by the Pentacam device with a\u00a0series of different algorithms of machine learning.\nHINTERGRUND UND ZIELSETZUNG: In den vergangenen Jahren wurden zunehmend Systeme der k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz in der Medizin etabliert, die Pathologien oder Erkrankungen erkennen oder von komplement\u00e4ren Erkrankungen abgrenzen. Bisher liefert das Corvis\u00aeST (Corneal Visualization Scheimpflug Technology, Oculus, Wetzlar, Deutschland) einen Index-CBI, der quasi bin\u00e4r Keratokonus klassifiziert, aber kein Staging zul\u00e4sst. Ziel der Studie ist es, anhand von Messgr\u00f6\u00dfen des Corvis\u00aeST ein Vorhersagemodell zu entwerfen, das den Topographic Keratoconus Classification Index (TKC) der Pentacam high resolution (HR, Oculus) nachbildet.\nEs wurden 60\u00a0Messungen an Normalprobanden (TKC\u00a00) und 379\u00a0Augen mit Keratokonus (TKC\u00a01 bis 4) in die Studie mit einbezogen. Nach der Messung mit der Pentacam HR (Zielgr\u00f6\u00dfe TKC) wurde eine Untersuchung mit dem Corvis\u00aeST durchgef\u00fchrt, aus der 6\u00a0Messparameter extrahiert wurden, die in den Corvis Biomechanical Index CBI eingehen (ARTh, SP-A1, DA-Ratio 1\u202fmm, DA-Ratio 2\u202fmm, A1 velocity, max. Deformation Amplitude). Neben dem TKC als Zielgr\u00f6\u00dfe wurde der binarisierte TKC (1: TKC\u00a01 bis 4, 0: TKC\u00a00) modelliert. Als G\u00fctema\u00df wurde die Genauigkeit des Modells als Anteil der korrekten Klassifizierungen herangezogen. Fehlklassifizierungen wurden in der Modellierung so bestraft, dass die Abweichung des modellierten TKC-Wertes vom gemessenen Wert bewertet wurde.\nEs wurden 24 verschiedene Modelle des \u00fcberwachten maschinellen Lernens aus 6\u00a0Familien getestet. F\u00fcr die Modellierung des TKC in Stufen von 0\u20134 zeigte das Modell, basierend auf einer Support Vector Machine (SVM) mit linearem Kernel, die beste Performance mit einem Anteil an richtigen Klassifizierungen von 65,1\u202f%. F\u00fcr den binarisierten Wert des TKC zeigte ein Decision Tree mit grober Aufl\u00f6sung die beste Performance mit einem Anteil an richtigen Klassifizierungen von 95,2\u202f%, direkt gefolgt von der SVM mit linearem oder quadratischem Kernel und dem Nearest Neighborhood Classifier mit kubischem Kernel (jeweils 94,5\u202f%).\nIn der Arbeit soll das Prinzip des \u00fcberwachten Maschinenlernens in der Anwendung auf die modellierte Klassifizierung von Messbefunden gezeigt werden. So wurden Messdaten des Corvis\u00aeST dazu verwendet, die Einteilung in den Schweregrad eines Keratokonus mittels Pentacam (TKC) mit einer ganzen Reihe von Algorithmen des maschinellen Lernens nachzubilden.", "The Cognitive Reserve (CR) describes the brain's ability to actively cope with neurological damage, enabling the maintenance of premorbid cognitive functioning through compensatory processes. The most common way to estimate CR is through formal education, the intelligence quotient (IQ) and participation in cognitive stimulating activities. In the absence of IQ data, the Irregular Word Reading Test (TeLPI) allows you to estimate the premorbid intelligence.\nThe comparison of the TeLPI results between two times of assessment (baseline and re-assessment) with an interval time (IT) of 9\u2009years. To analyze of the stability of their results as a valid dimension for the CR estimation.\nThe TeLPI presented temporal stability of its results between the two evaluation times (IT\u2009=\u20099.07\u2009\u00b1\u20091.02). The sample, composed by 63 cognitively healthy participants, showed no differences for the estimated Full Scale IQ (t(62)\u2009=\u20090.49, p\u2009=\u2009.63), for the Estimated Verbal IQ (t(62)\u2009=\u20090.71, p\u2009=\u2009.48) and for the estimated Performance IQ (t(62)\u2009=\u20090.64, p\u2009=\u2009.52). Likewise, no differences were found in the number of TeLPI errors at the two assessment times (t(62)\u2009=\u2009-0.61, p\u2009=\u2009.54).\nConsidering that CR is characterized as being relatively stable, the TeLPI should be included in its assessment, as an indicator with proved stability over a long period of time, on the physiological aging spectrum.", "Deep learning in in vitro fertilization is currently being evaluated in the development of assistive tools for the determination of transfer order and implantation potential using time-lapse data collected through expensive imaging hardware. Assistive tools and algorithms that can work with static images, however, can help in improving the access to care by enabling their use with images acquired from traditional microscopes that are available to virtually all fertility centers. Here, we evaluated the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), trained using single timepoint images of embryos collected at 113 hr post-insemination, in embryo selection amongst 97 clinical patient cohorts (742 embryos) and observed an accuracy of 90% in choosing the highest quality embryo available. Furthermore, a CNN trained to assess an embryo's implantation potential directly using a set of 97 euploid embryos capable of implantation outperformed 15 trained embryologists (75.26% vs. 67.35%, p<0.0001) from five different fertility centers.\nAround one in seven couples have trouble conceiving, which means there is a high demand for solutions such as in vitro fertilization, also known as IVF. This process involves fertilizing and developing embryos in the laboratory and then selecting a few to implant into the womb of the patient. IVF, however, only has a 30% success rate, is expensive and can be both mentally and physically taxing for patients. Selecting the right embryos to implant is therefore extremely important, as this increases the chance of success, minimizes complications and ensures the baby will be healthy. Currently the tools available for making this decision are limited, highly subjective, time-consuming, and often extremely expensive. As a result, embryologists often rely on their experience and observational skills when choosing which embryos to implant, which can lead to a lot of variability. An automated system based on artificial intelligence (AI) could therefore improve IVF success rates by assisting embryologists with this decision and ensuring more consistent results. The AI system could learn how embryos develop over time and then uses this information to select the best embryos to implant from just a single image. This would offer a cheaper alternative to current analysis tools that are only available at the most expensive IVF clinics. Now, Bormann, Kanakasabapathy, Thirumalaraj et al. have developed an AI system for IVF based on thousands of images of embryos. Using individual images, the system selected embryos of a comparable quality to those selected by a human specialist. It also showed a greater ability to identify embryos that will lead to successful implantation. Indeed, the software outperformed 15 embryologists from five different centers across the United States in detecting which embryos were most likely to implant out of a group of high-quality embryos with few visible differences. Artificial intelligence has many potential applications to support expert clinical decision-making. Systems like these could improve success, reduce errors and lead to faster, cheaper and more accessible results. Beyond immediate IVF applications, this system could also be used in research and industry to help understand differences in embryo quality.", "Clinical trials of MEK inhibitors are underway in pediatric low-grade glioma (PLGG) with BRAF oncogene mutations and recurrent/refractory disease. Cognitive and behavioral impacts of MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, are unknown as these outcomes have not yet been studied. This case series compared cognition and behavior in eight PLGG cases prior to and while on treatment with trametinib compared to four PLGG controls. Intelligence in the trametinib cases was mainly unchanged while on treatment, with mild decline in one of seven cases with complete data. Parent-reported depression symptoms increased in five of eight trametinib cases relative to one of four controls.", "To compare the accuracy of artificial intelligence formulas (Kane formula and Radial Basis Function [RBF] 2.0) and other formulas, including the original and modified Wang-Koch (MWK) adjustment formulas for Holladay 1 (H1-MWK) and SRK/T (SRK/T-WK and SRK/T-MWK), the Barrett Universal II (BUII), the emmetropia-verifying optical (EVO), and the Haigis equation in highly myopic eyes.\nRetrospective consecutive case-series study.\nA total of 370 eyes with an axial length (AL) \u226526.0\u00a0mm of 370 patients were enrolled, and subgroup analyses was performed based on ALs. The median absolute error (MedAE), the percentages of eyes with hyperopic outcome and within \u00b10.25 diopters (D), \u00b10.50 D, and \u00b11.00 D of prediction error were determined.\nOverall, the Kane equation had the lowest MedAE (0.26 D), followed by H1-WK (0.27 D) and H1-MWK (0.28 D). There were no significant differences in MedAE among the Kane equation, the RBF 2.0, the BUII, the H1-MWK, and the H1-WK, whereas the Kane equation had a significantly lower MedAE than EVO (P < .001), SRK/T-MWK (P\u00a0= .001), SRK/T-WK (P\u00a0= .006), and Haigis (P < .001). In extremely myopic eyes with an AL \u226530.0\u00a0mm (n\u00a0= 115), the Kane equation had a significantly lower MedAE than the RBF 2.0 (P\u00a0= .001), the EVO (P\u00a0= .019), the BUII (P\u00a0= .013), and the Haigis method (P\u00a0= .005), whereas no significant differences were found among the Kane, H1-MWK, and H1-WK equations.\nThe Kane equation was comparable to RBF 2.0, BUII, H1-MWK, and H1-WK in highly myopic eyes and was better than RBF 2.0 and BUII in extremely myopic eyes.

Cultural competence is an essential part of the curriculum to prepare physiotherapy students for their graduate practice. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a 4-week educational intervention to increase the perceived cultural competence of undergraduate physiotherapy students and whether effectiveness changed as students progressed in their education. Secondary aims were to understand if a clinical placement prior to the course intervention, or the student's cultural background, influenced the effectiveness of the intervention.\nA prospective cohort study was conducted with 73 students in their second year of an Australian Bachelor of Physiotherapy programme who participated in a 4-week tutorial module to develop their cultural competence. Perception of cultural competence was measured at three time points (pre, post, post 18 months) using the Cultural Intelligence Scale questionnaire which assesses metacognitive, cognitive, motivational and behavioural domains. Participant and their parents' country of birth data were collected.\nCultural intelligence scores for the cohort significantly increased from pre- to post-intervention (mean change 0.4, p < 0.001). A 3-week clinical placement prior to the teaching intervention had no effect on the change in scores. Students who were not born in Australia, or who had a parent not born in Australia, demonstrated less change in overall cultural intelligence score than Australian-born participants.\nUndergraduate physiotherapy students at an Australian university can increase their perceived level of cultural competence by participating in a 4-week classroom-based tutorial module, and this effect can be sustained over an 18-month period. Exposure to cultural diversity is not sufficient by itself for a change in perceived cultural competence. However, classroom-based teaching needs to be responsive to the cultural characteristics of the students.", "The coronavirus pandemic and its unprecedented consequences globally has spurred the interest of the artificial intelligence research community. A plethora of published studies have investigated the role of imaging such as chest X-rays and computer tomography in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) automated diagnosis. \u039fpen repositories of medical imaging data can play a significant role by promoting cooperation among institutes in a world-wide scale. However, they may induce limitations related to variable data quality and intrinsic differences due to the wide variety of scanner vendors and imaging parameters. In this study, a state-of-the-art custom U-Net model is presented with a dice similarity coefficient performance of 99.6% along with a transfer learning VGG-19 based model for COVID-19 versus pneumonia differentiation exhibiting an area under curve of 96.1%.

We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses deep learning to automatically detect such lesions in CCE images.\nWe trained a deep convolutional neural network system based on a Single Shot MultiBox Detector using 15 933 CCE images of colorectal neoplasms, such as polyps and cancers. We assessed performance by calculating areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves, along with sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies, using an independent test set of 4784 images, including 1850 images of colorectal neoplasms and 2934 normal colon images.\nThe area under the curve for detection of colorectal neoplasia by the AI model was 0.902. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 79.0\u200a%, 87.0\u200a%, and 83.9\u200a%, respectively, at a probability cutoff of 0.348.\nWe developed and validated a new AI-based system that automatically detects colorectal neoplasms in CCE images.", "Insect detection and control at an early stage are essential to the built environment (human-made physical spaces such as homes, hotels, camps, hospitals, parks, pavement, food industries, etc.) and agriculture fields. Currently, such insect control measures are manual, tedious, unsafe, and time-consuming labor dependent tasks. With the recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of things (IoT), several maintenance tasks can be automated, which significantly improves productivity and safety. This work proposes a real-time remote insect trap monitoring system and insect detection method using IoT and Deep Learning (DL) frameworks. The remote trap monitoring system framework is constructed using IoT and the Faster RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) Residual neural Networks 50 (ResNet50) unified object detection framework. The Faster RCNN ResNet 50 object detection framework was trained with built environment insects and farm field insect images and deployed in IoT. The proposed system was tested in real-time using four-layer IoT with built environment insects image captured through sticky trap sheets. Further, farm field insects were tested through a separate insect image database. The experimental results proved that the proposed system could automatically identify the built environment insects and farm field insects with an average of 94% accuracy.", "Early detection is the key to successfully tackling dementia, a neurocognitive condition common among the elderly. Therefore, screening using technological platforms such as mobile applications (apps) may provide an important opportunity to speed up the diagnosis process and improve accessibility. Due to the lack of research into dementia diagnosis and screening tools based on mobile apps, this systematic review aims to identify the available mobile-based dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) apps using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. More importantly, we critically analyse these tools in terms of their comprehensiveness, validity, performance, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The research findings suggest diagnosticians in a clinical setting use dementia screening apps such as ALZ and CognitiveExams since they cover most of the domains for the diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders. Further, apps such as Cognity and ACE-Mobile have great potential as they use machine learning (ML) and AI techniques, thus improving the accuracy of the outcome and the efficiency of the screening process. Lastly, there was overlapping among the dementia screening apps in terms of activities and questions they contain therefore mapping these apps to the designated cognitive domains is a challenging task, which has been done in this research.", "This review aims to shed light on recent applications of artificial intelligence in urologic oncology.\nArtificial intelligence algorithms harness the wealth of patient data to assist in diagnosing, staging, treating, and monitoring genitourinary malignancies.

Various methodologies have shown great promise in their ability to handle the complexity and size of MSI data sets. Advances in this area have been particularly appealing for MSI of biological samples, which typically produce highly complicated data with often subtle relationships between features. There are many different machine learning approaches that have been applied to MSI data over the past two decades. In this review, we focus on a subset of non-linear machine learning techniques that have mostly only been applied in the past 5\u2009years. Specifically, we review the use of the self-organizing map (SOM), SOM with relational perspective mapping (SOM-RPM), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). While not their only functionality, we have grouped these techniques based on their ability to produce what we refer to as similarity maps. Similarity maps are color representations of hyperspectral data, in which spectral similarity between pixels-that is, their distance in high-dimensional space-is represented by relative color similarity. In discussing these techniques, we describe, briefly, their associated algorithms and functionalities, and also outline applications in MSI research with a strong focus on biological sample types. The aim of this review is therefore to introduce this relatively recent paradigm for visualizing and exploring hyperspectral MSI, while also providing a comparison between each technique discussed.", "This study tested whether adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show the same pattern of difficulties and absence of age-related differences in short-term memory (STM) as those that have been reported in episodic long-term memory (LTM). Fifty-three adults with ASD (age range: 25-65\u2009years) were compared to 52 age-, biological sex-, and intelligence-matched typically developing (TD; age range: 21-67\u2009years) adults on three STM span tasks, which tested STM performance for letters (Verbal), grid locations (Visuospatial), or letters in grid locations (Multimodal). A subsample of 34 TD and 33 ASD participants ranging in age from 25 to 64\u2009years completed a fourth Multimodal Integration task. We also administered the Color Trails Test as a measure of executive function. ASD participants' accuracy was lower than that of the TD participants on the three span tasks (Cohen's d: 0.26-0.50). The Integration task difference was marginally significant (p = .07) but had a moderate effect size (Cohen's d = 0.50). Regression analyses confirmed reduced STM performance only for older TD participants. Analyses also indicated that executive processes played a greater role in the ASD group's performance. The demonstration of similar difficulties and age-related patterning of STM in ASD to those documented for LTM and the greater recruitment of executive processes by older ASD participants on the Integration task suggest a compensatory role of frontal processes both as a means of achieving undiminished task performance and as a possible protection against older age cognitive decline in ASD. Longitudinal research is needed to confirm this. Autism Res 2020, 13: 1970-1984. \u00a9 2020 The Authors. Autism Research published by International Society for Autism Research and Wiley Periodicals LLC. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about short-term memory (STM) in younger and older adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study tested different kinds of STM and showed that ASD adults remembered shorter sequences of letters, crosses, or letters in grid cells less well than matched participants with typical development. However, older ASD individuals performed similarly to younger ASD individuals, nor showing the reduction in performance usually seen with older age. The data suggest that ASD individuals use different underlying mechanisms when performing the tasks and that this might help protect their memory as they grow older.", "Today, the world suffers from the rapid spread of COVID-19, which has claimed thousands of lives. Unfortunately, its treatment is yet to be developed. Nevertheless, this phenomenon can be decelerated by diagnosing and quarantining patients with COVID-19 at early stages, thereby saving numerous lives. In this study, the early diagnosis of this disease through artificial intelligence (AI) technology is explored. AI is a revolutionizing technology that drives new research opportunities in various fields. Although this study does not provide a final solution, it highlights the most promising lines of research on AI technology for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The major contribution of this work is a discussion on the following substantial issues of AI technology for preventing the severe effects of COVID-19: (1) rapid diagnosis and detection, (2) outbreak and prediction of virus spread, and (3) potential treatments. This study profoundly investigates these controversial research topics to achieve a precise, concrete, and concise conclusion. Thus, this study provides significant recommendations on future research directions related to COVID-19.", "Helicobacter pylori plays a central role in the development of gastric cancer, and prediction of H pylori infection by visual inspection of the gastric mucosa is an important function of endoscopy. However, there are currently no established methods of optical diagnosis of H pylori infection using endoscopic images. Definitive diagnosis requires endoscopic biopsy. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly adopted in clinical practice, especially for image recognition and classification.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic test accuracy of AI for the prediction of H pylori infection using endoscopic images.\nTwo independent evaluators searched core databases. The inclusion criteria included studies with endoscopic images of H pylori infection and with application of AI for the prediction of H pylori infection presenting diagnostic performance. Systematic review and diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis were performed.\nUltimately, 8 studies were identified. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the curve of AI for the prediction of H pylori infection were 0.87 (95% CI 0.72-0.94), 0.86 (95% CI 0.77-0.92), 40 (95% CI 15-112), and 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94), respectively, in the 1719 patients (385 patients with H pylori infection vs 1334 controls). Meta-regression showed methodological quality and included the number of patients in each study for the purpose of heterogeneity. There was no evidence of publication bias. The accuracy of the AI algorithm reached 82% for discrimination between noninfected images and posteradication images.\nAn AI algorithm is a reliable tool for endoscopic diagnosis of H pylori infection. The limitations of lacking external validation performance and being conducted only in Asia should be overcome.\nPROSPERO CRD42020175957; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=175957.", "The estimation of premorbid intelligence (PI) is needed for an accurate diagnosis.\nThis study aimed to estimate the cognitive performance taking into account the PI in Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to healthy controls (HC); and to analyze the discrepancies between the current and the predicted cognitive performance based on the PI.\nSemantic fluency, verbal and visual memory, and executive functions were assessed in 39 PD and 162 HC. A linear regression model was used to analyze the discrepancies between the predicted cognitive performance and the current raw scores through PI variables (Word Accentuation Test (WAT), Pseudo-Words (PW) Reading subtest from PROLEC-R, age, and years of education). ROC analyses were performed to assess their diagnostic properties.\nSignificant differences were found in the raw cognitive scores between patients and HC [semantic fluency (t\u200a=\u200a6.07; p\u200a<\u200a0.001), verbal memory (t\u200a=\u200a6.63; p\u200a<\u200a0.001), and executive functions (t\u200a=\u200a2.57; p\u200a=\u200a0.013), and in visual memory (t\u200a=\u200a1.97; p\u200a=\u200a0.055 marginally significant)]. Compared to HC, PD patients presented higher discrepancies between the predicted cognitive performance and the raw scores in semantic fluency, verbal memory, visual memory, executive functions (AUC\u200a=\u200a0.78, 0.78; 0.64, 0.61, respectively).\nThe magnitude of the discrepancies scores between the current and the predicted cognitive performance based on PI indicates the presence of cognitive decline in the specific cognitive domain in PD patients. This study underlines the usefulness of premorbid measures and variables, such as WAT, PW, age, and years of education, to more accurately estimate the cognitive performance in PD.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been attracting considerable attention as an important scientific topic in the field of medicine. Deep-leaning (DL) technologies have been applied more dominantly than other traditional machine-learning methods. They have demonstrated excellent capability to retract visual features of objectives, even unnoticeable ones for humans, and analyze huge amounts of information within short periods. The amount of research applying DL-based models to real-time computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems has been increasing steadily in the GI endoscopy field. An array of published data has already demonstrated the advantages of DL-based CAD models in the detection and characterization of various neoplastic lesions, regardless of the level of the GI tract. Although the diagnostic performances and study designs vary widely, owing to a lack of academic standards to assess the capability of AI for GI endoscopic diagnosis fairly, the superiority of CAD models has been demonstrated for almost all applications studied so far. Most of the challenges associated with AI in the endoscopy field are general problems for AI models used in the real world outside of medical fields. Solutions have been explored seriously and some solutions have been tested in the endoscopy field. Given that AI has become the basic technology to make machines react to the environment, AI would be a major technological paradigm shift, for not only diagnosis but also treatment. In the near future, autonomous endoscopic diagnosis might no longer be just a dream, as we are witnessing with the advent of autonomously driven electric vehicles.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-aided decision support has developed rapidly to meet the needs for effective analysis of substantial data sets from electronic medical records and medical images generated daily, and computer-assisted intelligent drug design. In clinical practice, paediatricians make medical decisions after obtaining a large amount of information about symptoms, physical examinations, laboratory test indicators, special examinations and treatments. This information is used in combination with paediatricians' knowledge and experience to form the basis of clinical decisions. This diagnosis and therapeutic strategy development based on large amounts of information storage can be applied to both large clinical databases and data for individual patients. To date, AI applications have been of great value in intelligent diagnosis and treatment, intelligent image recognition, research and development of intelligent drugs and intelligent health management. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the research and clinical use of AI in paediatrics.", "A rising number of conversational agents or chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) architecture. They are increasingly prevalent in health care applications such as those providing education and support to patients with chronic diseases, one of the leading causes of death in the 21st century. AI-based chatbots enable more effective and frequent interactions with such patients.\nThe goal of this systematic literature review is to review the characteristics, health care conditions, and AI architectures of AI-based conversational agents designed specifically for chronic diseases.\nWe conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, PyscInfo, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. We applied a predefined search strategy using the terms \"conversational agent,\" \"healthcare,\" \"artificial intelligence,\" and their synonyms. We updated the search results using Google alerts, and screened reference lists for other relevant articles. We included primary research studies that involved the prevention, treatment, or rehabilitation of chronic diseases, involved a conversational agent, and included any kind of AI architecture. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and data extraction, and Cohen kappa was used to measure interrater agreement.A narrative approach was applied for data synthesis.\nThe literature search found 2052 articles, out of which 10 papers met the inclusion criteria. The small number of identified studies together with the prevalence of quasi-experimental studies (n=7) and prevailing prototype nature of the chatbots (n=7) revealed the immaturity of the field. The reported chatbots addressed a broad variety of chronic diseases (n=6), showcasing a tendency to develop specialized conversational agents for individual chronic conditions. However, there lacks comparison of these chatbots within and between chronic diseases. In addition, the reported evaluation measures were not standardized, and the addressed health goals showed a large range. Together, these study characteristics complicated comparability and open room for future research. While natural language processing represented the most used AI technique (n=7) and the majority of conversational agents allowed for multimodal interaction (n=6), the identified studies demonstrated broad heterogeneity, lack of depth of reported AI techniques and systems, and inconsistent usage of taxonomy of the underlying AI software, further aggravating comparability and generalizability of study results.\nThe literature on AI-based conversational agents for chronic conditions is scarce and mostly consists of quasi-experimental studies with chatbots in prototype stage that use natural language processing and allow for multimodal user interaction. Future research could profit from evidence-based evaluation of the AI-based conversational agents and comparison thereof within and between different chronic health conditions. Besides increased comparability, the quality of chatbots developed for specific chronic conditions and their subsequent impact on the target patients could be enhanced by more structured development and standardized evaluation processes.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered as the next natural progression of traditional statistical techniques. Advances in analytical methods and infrastructure enable AI to be applied in health care. While AI applications are relatively common in fields like ophthalmology and cardiology, its use is scarcely reported in nephrology. We present the current status of AI in research toward kidney disease and discuss future pathways for AI. The clinical applications of AI in progression to end-stage kidney disease and dialysis can be broadly subdivided into three main topics: (a) predicting events in the future such as mortality and hospitalization; (b) providing treatment and decision aids such as automating drug prescription; and (c) identifying patterns such as phenotypical clusters and arteriovenous fistula aneurysm. At present, the use of prediction models in treating patients with kidney disease is still in its infancy and further evidence is needed to identify its relative value. Policies and regulations need to be addressed before implementing AI solutions at the point of care in clinics. AI is not anticipated to replace the nephrologists' medical decision-making, but instead assist them in providing optimal personalized care for their patients.", "Surrogate Modeling (SM) is often used to reduce the computational burden of time-consuming system simulations. However, continuous advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the spread of embedded sensors have led to the creation of Digital Twins (DT), Design Mining (DM), and Soft Sensors (SS). These methodologies represent a new challenge for the generation of surrogate models since they require the implementation of elaborated artificial intelligence algorithms and minimize the number of physical experiments measured. To reduce the assessment of a physical system, several existing adaptive sequential sampling methodologies have been developed; however, they are limited in most part to the Kriging models and Kriging-model-based Monte Carlo Simulation. In this paper, we integrate a distinct adaptive sampling methodology to an automated machine learning methodology (AutoML) to help in the process of model selection while minimizing the system evaluation and maximizing the system performance for surrogate models based on artificial intelligence algorithms. In each iteration, this framework uses a grid search algorithm to determine the best candidate models and perform a leave-one-out cross-validation to calculate the performance of each sampled point. A Voronoi diagram is applied to partition the sampling region into some local cells, and the Voronoi vertexes are considered as new candidate points. The performance of the sample points is used to estimate the accuracy of the model for a set of candidate points to select those that will improve more the model's accuracy. Then, the number of candidate models is reduced. Finally, the performance of the framework is tested using two examples to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.", "A combination of a fuzzy inference system (FIS) and a differential evolution (DE) algorithm, known as the differential evolution-based fuzzy inference system (DEFIS), is developed for the prediction of natural heat transfer in Cu-water nanofluid within a cavity. In the development of the hybrid model, the DE algorithm is used for the training process of FIS. For this purpose, first, the case study is simulated using the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method. The CFD outputs, including velocity in the y-direction, the temperature of the nanofluid, and the nanoparticle content (\u00d8), are employed for the learning process of the DEFIS model. By choosing the optimum number of inputs and the number of population, the underlying DEFIS variable parameters are studied. After reaching the high value of DEFIS intelligence, in the learning step, a variety of \u00d8 values (e.g., 0.5, 1, and 2) are reviewed. For the full intelligence of DEFIS, the velocity of the nanofluid is predicted in further nodes of the cavity domain. Finally, the velocity of the nanofluid is predicted by using the data at \u00d8 = 0.15, which are absent in the DEFIS process.", "Skin is the largest organ, with the functionalities of protection, regulation, and sensation. The emulation of human skin via flexible and stretchable electronics gives rise to electronic skin (e-skin), which has realized artificial sensation and other functions that cannot be achieved by conventional electronics. To date, tremendous progress has been made in data acquisition and transmission for e-skin systems, while the implementation of perception within systems, that is, sensory data processing, is still in its infancy. Integrating the perception functionality into a flexible and stretchable sensing system, namely artificial skin perception, is critical to endow current e-skin systems with higher intelligence. Here, recent progress in the design and fabrication of artificial skin perception devices and systems is summarized, and challenges and prospects are discussed. The strategies for implementing artificial skin perception utilize either conventional silicon-based circuits or novel flexible computing devices such as memristive devices and synaptic transistors, which enable artificial skin to surpass human skin, with a distributed, low-latency, and energy-efficient information-processing ability. In future, artificial skin perception would be a new enabling technology to construct next-generation intelligent electronic devices and systems for advanced applications, such as robotic surgery, rehabilitation, and prosthetics.", "Advances in reagents, methodologies, analytic platforms, and tools have resulted in a dramatic transformation of the research pathology laboratory. These advances have increased our ability to efficiently generate substantial volumes of data on the expression and accumulation of mRNA, proteins, carbohydrates, signaling pathways, cells, and structures in healthy and diseased tissues that are objective, quantitative, reproducible, and suitable for statistical analysis. The goal of this review is to identify and present how to acquire the critical information required to measure changes in tissues. Included is a brief overview of two morphometric techniques, image analysis and stereology, and the use of artificial intelligence to classify cells and identify hidden patterns and relationships in digital images. In addition, we explore the importance of preanalytical factors in generating high-quality data. This review focuses on techniques we have used to measure proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, and immune cells in tissues using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to demonstrate the various morphometric techniques. When performed correctly, quantitative digital pathology is a powerful tool that provides unbiased quantitative data that are difficult to obtain with other methods.", "In this study, a square cavity is modeled using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as well as artificial intelligence (AI) approach. In the square cavity, copper (Cu) nanoparticle is the nanofluid and the flow velocity characteristics in the x-direction and y-direction, and the fluid temperature inside the cavity at different times are considered as CFD outputs. CFD outputs have been assessed using one of the artificial intelligence algorithms, such as a combination of neural network and fuzzy logic (ANFIS). As in the ANFIS method, we have a non-dimension procedure in the learning step, and there is no issue in combining other characteristics of the flow and thermal distribution beside the x and y coordinates, we combine two coordinate parameters and one flow parameter. This ability of method can be considered as a meshless learning step that there is no instability of the numerical method or limitation of boundary conditions. The data were classified using the grid partition method and the MF (membership function) type was dsigmf (difference between two sigmoidal membership functions). By achieving the appropriate intelligence in the ANFIS method, output prediction was performed at the points of cavity which were not included in the learning process and were compared to the existing data (the results of the CFD method) and were validated by them. This new combination of CFD and the ANFIS method enables us to learn flow and temperature distribution throughout the domain thoroughly, and eventually predict the flow characteristics in short computational time. The results from AI in the ANFIS method were compared to the ant colony and fuzzy logic methods. The data from CFD results were inserted into the ant colony system for the training process, and we predicted the data in the fuzzy logic system. Then, we compare the data with the ANFIS method. The results indicate that the ANFIS method has a high potentiality compared to the ant colony method because the amount of R in the ANIFS system is higher than R in the ant colony method. In the ANFIS method, R is equal to 0.99, and in the ant colony method, R is equal to 0.91. This shows that the ant colony needs more time for both the prediction and training of the system. Also, comparing the pattern recognition in the two systems, we can obviously see that by using the ANFIS method, the predictions completely match the target points. But the other method cannot match the flow pattern and velocity distribution with the CFD method.", "The Trial-Ready Cohort for Preclinical and Prodromal Alzheimer's disease (TRC-PAD) aims to accelerate enrollment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials by remotely identifying and tracking individuals who are at high risk for developing symptoms of AD, and referring these individuals to in-person cognitive and biomarker evaluation with the purpose of engaging them in clinical trials. A risk algorithm using statistical modeling to predict brain amyloidosis will be refined as TRC-PAD advances with a maturing data set.\nTo provide a summary of the steps taken to build this Trial-Ready cohort (TRC) and share results of the first 3 years of enrollment into the program.\nParticipants are remotely enrolled in the Alzheimer Prevention Trials (APT) Webstudy with quarterly assessments, and through an algorithm identified as potentially at high risk, referred to clinical sites for biomarker confirmation, and enrolled into the TRC.\nBoth an online study and in-clinic non-interventional cohort study.\nAPT Webstudy participants are aged 50 or older, with an interest in participation in AD therapeutic trials. TRC participants must have a study partner, stable medical condition, and elevated brain amyloid, as measured by amyloid positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Additional risk assessments include apolipoprotein E genotyping.\nIn the APT Webstudy, participants complete the Cognitive Function Index and Cogstate Brief Battery. The TRC includes the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite, comprised of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, the Delayed Paragraph Recall score on the Logical Memory IIa test from the Wechsler Memory Scale, the Digit-Symbol Substitution test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, and the Mini Mental State Examination total score (1).\nDuring the first 3 years of this program, the APT Webstudy has 30,650 consented participants, with 23 sites approved for in person screening, 112 participants have been referred for in-clinic screening visits with eighteen enrolled to the TRC. The majority of participants consented to APT Webstudy have a family history of AD (62%), identify as Caucasian (92.5%), have over twelve years of formal education (85%), and are women (73%). Follow up rates for the first quarterly assessment were 38.2% with 29.5% completing the follow up Cogstate Battery.\nAfter successfully designing and implementing this program, the study team's priority is to improve diversity of participants both in the APT Webstudy and TRC, to continue enrollment into the TRC to our target of 2,000, and to improve longitudinal retention, while beginning the process of referring TRC participants into clinical trials.", "Our access to a unique material of postmortem brains obtained from decades of data collection enabled a stereological analysis of the neuron numbers and correlation of results with individual premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ) data. In our sample of 50 brains from men, we find that IQ does not correlate with the number of brain cells in the human neocortex and was only weakly correlated to brain weight. Our stereological examination extended to measures of several other parameters that might be of relevance to intelligence, including numbers of cerebral glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) and the volume of key areas in the gray and white matter and of the cerebral ventricles, also showing near-zero nonsignificant correlations to IQ.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently being introduced into different domains, including medicine. Specifically in radiation oncology, machine learning models allow automation and optimization of the workflow. A lack of knowledge and interpretation of these AI models can hold back wide-spread and full deployment into clinical practice. To facilitate the integration of AI models in the radiotherapy workflow, generally applicable recommendations on implementation and quality assurance (QA) of AI models are presented. For commonly used applications in radiotherapy such as auto-segmentation, automated treatment planning and synthetic computed tomography (sCT) the basic concepts are discussed in depth. Emphasis is put on the commissioning, implementation and case-specific and routine QA of AI models needed for a methodical introduction in clinical practice.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has widely spread worldwide and caused a pandemic. Chest CT has been found to play an important role in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. However, quantitatively assessing temporal changes of COVID-19 pneumonia over time using CT has still not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to perform a longitudinal study to quantitatively assess temporal changes of COVID-19 pneumonia.\nThis retrospective and multi-center study included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection from 16 hospitals between January 19 and March 27, 2020. Mass was used as an approach to quantitatively measure dynamic changes of pulmonary involvement in patients with COVID-19. Artificial intelligence (AI) was employed as image segmentation and analysis tool for calculating the mass of pulmonary involvement.\nA total of 581 confirmed patients with 1,309 chest CT examinations were included in this study. The median age was 46 years (IQR, 35-55; range, 4-87 years), and 311 (53.5%) patients were male. The mass of pulmonary involvement peaked on day 10 after the onset of initial symptoms. Furthermore, the mass of pulmonary involvement of older patients (>45 years) was significantly severer (P<0.001) and peaked later (day 11 vs. day 8) than that of younger patients (\u226445 years). In addition, there were no significant differences in the peak time (day 10 vs. day 10) and median mass (P=0.679) of pulmonary involvement between male and female.\nPulmonary involvement peaked on day 10 after the onset of initial symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Further, pulmonary involvement of older patients was severer and peaked later than that of younger patients. These findings suggest that AI-based quantitative mass evaluation of COVID-19 pneumonia hold great potential for monitoring the disease progression.", "To assess the psychometric properties of the Draw a Person: A Quantitative Scoring System (DAP:QSS), in 2543 children (M\u2009=\u200911.43\u2009\u00b1\u20093.06\u00a0years), correlations between drawings scores and Raven's Matrices scores, age, and academic achievement were examined. Although older children (>\u200911\u00a0years) obtained higher drawing scores than younger ones (p\u2009<\u20090.001), age significantly correlated with DAP:QSS scores only in children younger than 11\u00a0years (r\u2009=\u20090.493, p\u2009<\u20090.001), indicating conflictive evidence for construct validity and a possible ceiling effect. No correlations emerged between DAP:QSS scores and grades (r\u2009=\u20090.056, p\u2009=\u20090.097). DAP:QSS scores were significantly associated with Raven's Matrices score, but low correlation coefficients (0.156-0.498), low sensitivity (0.12), and high false negative (87.9%) and positive (82%) rates suggest poor DAP:QSS validity as an intelligence measure. The researchers concluded that DAP:QSS failed to produce a psychometrically sound assessment of children's intellectual functioning.", "Health impact assessment (HIA) is a systematic and flexible tool, which is advocated by the World Health Organisation as a method through which to consider the impact of policies on the health and well-being of a population, and the inequalities that may arise because of it. In 2018, the HIA support unit in Wales carried out a comprehensive and unique HIA on the impact of Brexit in Wales. The aims were to understand the differential impacts that Brexit would have on the health and well-being of the population and to provide evidence to inform decision makers across a range of public bodies. It followed a five-step process for HIA and utilised a wide range of evidence sources and health intelligence including both quantitative and qualitative evidence. This paper reflects on the process of carrying out the HIA and the methods used. It discusses the stages of the HIA, and shares the findings and reflections of implementation which will be beneficial to other HIA practitioners and policy makers. It does not concentrate on the findings of the HIA in detail, but focusses on what worked and any challenges encountered. It has been used to progress the practice of HIA in Wales and demonstrates the value of HIA as a method to inform and influence complex decisions.", "We develop an auto-reservoir computing framework, Auto-Reservoir Neural Network (ARNN), to efficiently and accurately make multi-step-ahead predictions based on a short-term high-dimensional time series. Different from traditional reservoir computing whose reservoir is an external dynamical system irrelevant to the target system, ARNN directly transforms the observed high-dimensional dynamics as its reservoir, which maps the high-dimensional/spatial data to the future temporal values of a target variable based on our spatiotemporal information (STI) transformation. Thus, the multi-step prediction of the target variable is achieved in an accurate and computationally efficient manner. ARNN is successfully applied to both representative models and real-world datasets, all of which show satisfactory performance in the multi-step-ahead prediction, even when the data are perturbed by noise and when the system is time-varying. Actually, such ARNN transformation equivalently expands the sample size and thus has great potential in practical applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning.", "The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in the aging population, challenging the sustainability of traditional care models that have relied on in-person monitoring. This debate article discusses whether artificial intelligence health monitoring may be suitable enhancement or replacement for elder care.\nInternationally, as life expectancy continues to rise, many countries are facing a severe shortage of direct care workers. The health workforce is aging, and replacement remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence health monitoring technologies may play a novel and significant role in filling the human resource gaps in caring for older adults by complementing current care provision, reducing the burden on family caregivers, and improving the quality of care. Nonetheless, opportunities brought on by these emerging technologies raise ethical questions that must be addressed to ensure that these automated systems can truly enhance care and health outcomes for older adults. This debate article explores some ethical dimensions of using automated health monitoring technologies. It argues that, in order for these health monitoring technologies to fulfill the wishes of older adults to age in place and also to empower them and improve their quality of life, we need deep knowledge of how stakeholders may balance their considerations of relational care, safety, and privacy.\nIt is only when we design artificial intelligence health monitoring technologies with intersecting clinical and ethical factors in mind that the resulting systems will enhance productive relational care, facilitate independent living, promote older adults' health outcomes, and minimize waste.", "Early-life carbamate exposure during developmental period has been linked with adverse health effects and attracted attention.\nThree hundred and three children at age of seven were included in the current study. Urinary carbofuranphenol concentrations were measured using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Verbal, performance and full-scale intelligence quotients (IQV, IQP, and IQFS) were assessed using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Chinese Revised. Generalized linear models were used to explore the associations between carbofuranphenol levels and IQs. Generalized estimating equations were used to explore long-term health effect and sensitive time window.\nCarbofuranphenol was detected in 96.6% of the seven-year-old urinary samples, the geometric mean, median, and inter quartile range of the carbofuranphenol concentrations were 0.67\u00a0\u03bcg/L, 0.30\u00a0\u03bcg/L, and 0.09-3.72\u00a0\u03bcg/L, respectively, which were similar with the level of three-year-old children from the SMBCS cohort. Seven-year-old carbofuranphenol level was negatively associated with IQP [\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.044; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.087, -0.001; p\u00a0=\u00a00.045]. Three-year-old carbofuranphenol level was negatively associated with IQP (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.100; 95% CI: -0.186, -0.014; p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and IQFS (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.087; 95% CI: -0.173, -0.001; p\u00a0=\u00a00.047). Carbamate exposure of maternal and children at both three and seven years old had negative associations with IQP (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.089; 95% CI: -0.171, -0.007; p\u00a0=\u00a00.034), and IQFS (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.064; 95% CI: -0.127, -0.000; p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) of children at age of seven.\nResults of the present study verify that children in an agricultural region of China were widely exposed to carbamate pesticides. Carbamate exposure in utero and at three and seven years may adversely impact children's neurodevelopment.", "A big-data-driven and artificial intelligence (AI) with machine learning (ML) approach has never been integrated with the hospital information system (HIS) for predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with chest pain in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, we conducted the present study to clarify it.\nIn total, 85,254 ED patients with chest pain in three hospitals between 2009 and 2018 were identified. We randomized the patients into a 70%/30% split for ML model training and testing. We used 14 clinical variables from their electronic health records to construct a random forest model with the synthetic minority oversampling technique preprocessing algorithm to predict acute myocardial infarction (AMI) <\u20091\u2009month and all-cause mortality <\u20091\u2009month. Comparisons of the predictive accuracies among random forest, logistic regression, support-vector clustering (SVC), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) models were also performed.\nPredicting MACE using the random forest model produced areas under the curves (AUC) of 0.915 for AMI <\u20091\u2009month and 0.999 for all-cause mortality <\u20091\u2009month. The random forest model had better predictive accuracy than logistic regression, SVC, and KNN. We further integrated the AI prediction model with the HIS to assist physicians with decision-making in real time. Validation of the AI prediction model by new patients showed AUCs of 0.907 for AMI <\u20091\u2009month and 0.888 for all-cause mortality <\u20091\u2009month.\nAn AI real-time prediction model is a promising method for assisting physicians in predicting MACE in ED patients with chest pain. Further studies to evaluate the impact on clinical practice are warranted.", "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS or rolandic epilepsy) present with a very high level of comorbidity. We aimed to review the existing literature focusing on two aspects: the possible role of epileptic activity in the damage of ADHD-related neural networks and the clinical approach to patients presenting with both conditions.\nA systematic review was performed using Sapienza Library System and PubMed. The following search terms have been considered: attention networks, ADHD, attention systems, rolandic epilepsy, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, centrotemporal spikes epilepsy, and focal epilepsy in children. The target population consisted of patients under 18\u202fyears of age diagnosed with either BECTS and ADHD or healthy controls.\nNine case-control and cohort studies have been selected. The reported prevalence of ADHD in patients with BECTS was around 60%. No clinical correlation was found between the medical records and the presence of ADHD in patients with BECTS, if not due to febrile convulsion (FC). One study showed higher levels of bilateral discharges in patients with severe ADHD. The negative influence of the age at onset of seizures was demonstrated on attention but not on intelligence quotient (IQ). Moreover, the frequency of seizures and the occurrence of discharges during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were correlated to attention impairment. From a neurobiological point of view, functional connectivity in patients with BECTS and ADHD appears to be disrupted. Two studies reported a specific impairment in selective visual attention, while one study underlined a decreased activation of the dorsal attention network (DAN). Two different studies found that patients with BECTS and comorbid ADHD presented with altered thickness in their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the cortical and subcortical regions (including the frontal lobes, lingual-fusiform cortex, cuneus and precuneus, limbic area and pericalcarine cortex among others). This might explain the cognitive and behavioral symptoms such as poor selective visual attention, speech disturbance, and impulsivity.\nDespite BECTS being considered to have a relative benign course, many studies have documented cognitive and/or behavioral problems in patients diagnosed with this type of epilepsy. In particular, children affected by rolandic epilepsy should receive a complete neuropsychological evaluation at seizure onset considering the high rate of comorbidity with ADHD. A further investigation of the common pathogenic substrate is desirable to better orientate the clinical and therapeutic interventions applied.", "Since the discovery of circulating tumor cells in 1869, technological advances in studying circulating biomarkers from patients' blood have made the diagnosis of nonhematologic cancers less invasive. Technological advances in the detection and analysis of biomarkers provide new opportunities for the characterization of other disease types. When compared with traditional biopsies, liquid biopsy markers, such as exfoliated bladder cancer cells, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and extracellular vesicles (EV),\u00a0are considered more convenient than conventional biopsies. Liquid biopsy markers undoubtedly have the potential to influence disease management and treatment dynamics. Our main focuses of this review will be the cell-based, gene-based, and protein-based key liquid biopsy markers (including EV and cfDNA) in disease detection, and discuss the research progress of these biomarkers used in conjunction with liquid biopsy. First, we highlighted the key technologies that have been broadly adopted used in hematological diseases. Second, we introduced the latest technological developments for the specific detection of cardiovascular disease, leukemia, and coronavirus disease. Finally, we concluded with perspectives on these research areas, focusing on the role of microfluidic technology and artificial intelligence in point-of-care medical applications. We believe that the noninvasive capabilities of these technologies have great potential in the development of diagnostics and can influence treatment options, thereby advancing precision disease management.", "To evaluate whether the initial chest X-ray (CXR) severity assessed by an AI system may have prognostic utility in patients with COVID-19.\nThis retrospective single-center study included adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) between February 25 and April 9, 2020, with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Initial CXRs obtained on ED presentation were evaluated by a deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) system and compared with the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score, calculated by two experienced radiologists. Death and critical COVID-19 (admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or deaths occurring before ICU admission) were identified as clinical outcomes. Independent predictors of adverse outcomes were evaluated by multivariate analyses.\nSix hundred ninety-seven 697 patients were included in the study: 465 males (66.7%), median age of 62 years (IQR 52-75). Multivariate analyses adjusting for demographics and comorbidities showed that an AI system-based score \u2265 30 on the initial CXR was an independent predictor both for mortality (HR 2.60 (95% CI 1.69 - 3.99; p < 0.001)) and critical COVID-19 (HR 3.40 (95% CI 2.35-4.94; p < 0.001)). Other independent predictors were RALE score, older age, male sex, coronary artery disease, COPD, and neurodegenerative disease.\nAI- and radiologist-assessed disease severity scores on CXRs obtained on ED presentation were independent and comparable predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04318366 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04318366 ).\n\u2022 AI system-based score \u2265 30 and a RALE score \u2265 12 at CXRs performed at ED presentation are independent and comparable predictors of death and/or ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. \u2022 Other independent predictors are older age, male sex, coronary artery disease, COPD, and neurodegenerative disease. \u2022 The comparable performance of the AI system in relation to a radiologist-assessed score in predicting adverse outcomes may represent a game-changer in resource-constrained settings.", "eHealth is the use of information and communication technologies to enable and improve health and health care services. It is crucial that medical students receive adequate training in eHealth as they will work in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. This trend is especially accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic as it complicates traditional face-to-face medical consultations and highlights the need for innovative approaches in health care.\nThis review aims to evaluate the extent and nature of the existing literature on medical student training in eHealth. In detail, it aims to examine what this education consists of, the barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum. This review focuses primarily on some key technologies such as mobile health (mHealth), the internet of things (IoT), telehealth, and artificial intelligence (AI).\nSearches were performed on 4 databases, and articles were selected based on the eligibility criteria. Studies had to be related to the training of medical students in eHealth. The eligibility criteria were studies published since 2014, from a peer-reviewed journal, and written in either English or French. A grid was used to extract and chart data.\nThe search resulted in 25 articles. The most studied aspect was mHealth. eHealth as a broad concept, the IoT, AI, and programming were least covered. A total of 52% (13/25) of all studies contained an intervention, mostly regarding mHealth, electronic health records, web-based medical resources, and programming. The findings included various barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for improving the medical curriculum.\nTrends have emerged regarding the suboptimal present state of eHealth training and barriers, enhancing factors, and propositions for optimal training. We recommend that additional studies be conducted on the following themes: barriers, enhancing factors, propositions for optimal training, competencies that medical students should acquire, learning outcomes from eHealth training, and patient care outcomes from this training. Additional studies should be conducted on eHealth and each of its aspects, especially on the IoT, AI, programming, and eHealth as a broad concept. Training in eHealth is critical to medical practice in clinical environments that are increasingly being enabled by technology. The need for innovative approaches in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic further highlights the relevance of this training.", "Tropical biomes are the most diverse plant communities on Earth, and quantifying this diversity at large spatial scales is vital for many purposes. As macroecological approaches proliferate, the taxonomic uncertainties in species occurrence data are easily neglected and can lead to spurious findings in downstream analyses. Here, we argue that technological approaches offer potential solutions, but there is no single silver bullet to resolve uncertainty in plant biodiversity quantification. Instead, we propose the use of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to build a data-driven framework that integrates several data sources - including spectroscopy, DNA sequences, image recognition, and morphological data. Such a framework would provide a foundation for improving species identification in macroecological analyses while simultaneously improving the taxonomic process of species delimitation.", "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has a high prevalence, with an estimated 425 million adults with apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of \u226515 events/hour, and is significantly underdiagnosed. This presents a significant pain point for both the sufferers, and for healthcare systems, particularly in a post COVID-19 pandemic world. As such, it presents an opportunity for new technologies that can enable screening in both developing and developed countries. In this work, the performance of a non-contact OSA screener App that can run on both Apple and Android smartphones is presented.\nThe subtle breathing patterns of a person in bed can be measured via a smartphone using the \"Firefly\" app technology platform [and underpinning software development kit (SDK)], which utilizes advanced digital signal processing (DSP) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify detailed sleep stages, respiration rate, snoring, and OSA patterns. The smartphone is simply placed adjacent to the subject, such as on a bedside table, night stand or shelf, during the sleep session. The system was trained on a set of 128 overnights recorded at a sleep laboratory, where volunteers underwent simultaneous full polysomnography (PSG), and \"Firefly\" smartphone app analysis. A separate independent test set of 120 recordings was collected across a range of Apple iOS and Android smartphones, and withheld for performance evaluation by a different team. An operating point tuned for mid-sensitivity (i.e., balancing sensitivity and specificity) was chosen for the screener.\nThe performance on the test set is comparable to ambulatory OSA screeners, and other smartphone screening apps, with a sensitivity of 88.3% and specificity of 80.0% [with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92], for a clinical threshold for the AHI of \u226515 events/hour of detected sleep time.\nThe \"Firefly\" app based sensing technology offers the potential to significantly lower the barrier of entry to OSA screening, as no hardware (other than the user's personal smartphone) is required. Additionally, multi-night analysis is possible in the home environment, without requiring the wearing of a portable PSG or other home sleep test (HST).", "Multiple disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug (DMOAD) trials were done in the last two decades, but no pharmacological agent has yet been approved by regulatory agencies as an effective therapy to date. Given the fact that we have seen the recent discontinuation of several late-stage drug development trials, a careful strategy is needed in formulating a plan for a successful DMOAD trial - including the various roles of imaging. This narrative review article will summarize how imaging is utilized in osteoarthritis from the perspective of disease modification to clinical utility. We will describe how semi-quantitative and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging approaches have been deployed in DMOAD trials. We will then review the utility of musculoskeletal ultrasound in research and clinical settings. Finally, novel hybrid positron emission tomography/MRI techniques and current research using artificial intelligence will be discussed, focusing on original research. Older publications are included for the discussion of the previous DMOAD trials and other relevant topics where deemed appropriate.", "The application of artificial intelligence to clinical diagnostics using deep learning has been developed in recent years. In this study, we developed an original computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) system using deep learning analysis of EUS images (EUS-CAD), and assessed its ability to detect pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC), using control images from patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and those with a normal pancreas (NP).\nA total of 920 endosonographic images were used for the training and 10-fold cross-validation, and another 470 images were independently tested. The detection abilities in both the validation and test setting were assessed, and independent factors associated with misdetection were identified among participants' characteristics and endosonographic image features.\nRegarding the detection ability of EUS-CAD, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were found to be 0.924 and 0.940 in the validation and test setting, respectively. In the analysis of misdetection, no factors were identified on univariate analysis in PDAC cases. On multivariate analysis of non-PDAC cases, only mass formation was associated with overdiagnosis of tumors.\nOur pilot study demonstrated the efficacy of EUS-CAD for the detection of PDAC.", "Successful aging depends upon several internal and external factors that influence the overall aging process. Objective and subjective socioeconomic status emerge as potential psychosocial factors in the ethiopathophysiology of aging-related disorders. Presumably, low socioeconomic status can act as a psychosocial stressor that can affect humans' physiology via psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms, that may, in turn, affect the brain physiology. In resting-state electroencephalography (EEG), excess theta and delta activity has been related to cognitive decline and dementia. The main aim of this study was to analyze the effect of objective and subjective socioeconomic status (SES) on cognition and brain electrical activity through EEG measures. The present research constitutes a cross-sectional study with thirty healthy older adults (61-82 years old) separated into two clusters: high socioeconomic (HS) and low socioeconomic (LS) status; they were evaluated and compared in cognitive terms using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV). An EEG at rest was recorded to measure brain activity and, as an indicator of long-term stress exposure, hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) were measured. Our results show that lower SES is related to a worse performance in working memory tasks (p = 0.009), higher delta (p = 0.002) and theta power (p = 0.039), and lower alpha activity (p = 0.028). However, it seems that SES does not significantly affect HCC in this population of healthy older adults. The effects of SES on long-term cortisol exposure, brain electrical activity, and cognitive functions in healthy older people emphasize the role of psychosocial factors in aging from an integrative perspective that will allow us to implement better prevention programs to target cognitive decline in adults.", "The relevance of endoscopic monitoring of ulcerative colitis (UC) has been translated into the new concept of \"mucosal healing (MH)\" as the therapeutic goal to achieve because a large amount of scientific data have revealed the favorable prognostic value of a healed mucosa in determining the clinical outcome of UC. Recent interest in MH has skewed toward not only endoscopic remission but also histological improvement (so called histological MH). However, we should recognize that there have been no prospectively validated endoscopic scoring systems of UC activity in previous clinical trials. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted endoscopy has been developed for gastrointestinal cancer surveillance. Recently, several AI-assisted endoscopic systems have been developed for assessment of MH in UC. In the future, the development of a new endoscopic scoring system based on AI might standardize the definition of MH. Therefore, \"The road to an exact definition of MH in the treatment of UC has begun only now\".", "The CONSORT 2010 statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomized trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human-AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes.", "Artificial intelligence is increasingly being adopted in medical fields to predict various outcomes. In particular, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is problematic because it often progresses to end-stage kidney disease. However, the trajectories of kidney function depend on individual patients. In this study, we propose a machine learning-based model to predict the rapid decline in kidney function among CKD patients by using a big hospital database constructed from the information of 118,584 patients derived from the electronic medical records system. The database included the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of each patient, recorded at least twice over a period of 90 days. The data of 19,894 patients (16.8%) were observed to satisfy the CKD criteria. We characterized the rapid decline of kidney function by a decline of 30% or more in the eGFR within a period of two years and classified the available patients into two groups-those exhibiting rapid eGFR decline and those exhibiting non-rapid eGFR decline. Following this, we constructed predictive models based on two machine learning algorithms. Longitudinal laboratory data including urine protein, blood pressure, and hemoglobin were used as covariates. We used longitudinal statistics with a baseline corresponding to 90-, 180-, and 360-day windows prior to the baseline point. The longitudinal statistics included the exponentially smoothed average (ESA), where the weight was defined to be 0.9*(t/b), where t denotes the number of days prior to the baseline point and b denotes the decay parameter. In this study, b was taken to be 7 (7-day ESA). We used logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) algorithms based on Python code with scikit-learn library (https://scikit-learn.org/) for model creation. The areas under the curve for LR and RF were 0.71 and 0.73, respectively. The 7-day ESA of urine protein ranked within the first two places in terms of importance according to both models. Further, other features related to urine protein were likely to rank higher than the rest. The LR and RF models revealed that the degree of urine protein, especially if it exhibited an increasing tendency, served as a prominent risk factor associated with rapid eGFR decline.", "Gastric vascular abnormalities are a well known cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. Due to their recurrent bleeding tendency and potential to cause life-threatening blood loss, gastric vascular abnormalities can result in significant morbidity and cost.\nThere have been novel advances in medical and endoscopic management of gastric vascular lesions. New data suggest that endoscopic band ligation and ablation may be comparable, or even superior, to argon plasma coagulation (APC) for management of gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE). A creative, highly sensitive and specific computer-assisted tool has been developed to facilitate reading video capsule endoscopies for the detection of angiodysplasias, paving the way for artificial intelligence incorporation in vascular lesions diagnostics. Over-the-scope clipping is a relatively new technology that shows promising results in controlling bleeding from Dieulafoy's lesions.\nIn this article, we will broadly review the management of the most prevalent gastric vascular lesions, focusing on the most recent areas of research.", "The prediction of exceptional or surprising growth in research is an issue with deep roots and few practical solutions. In this study, we develop and validate a novel approach to forecasting growth in highly specific research communities. Each research community is represented by a cluster of papers. Multiple indicators were tested, and a composite indicator was created that predicts which research communities will experience exceptional growth over the next three years. The accuracy of this predictor was tested using hundreds of thousands of community-level forecasts and was found to exceed the performance benchmarks established in Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity's (IARPA) Foresight Using Scientific Exposition (FUSE) program in six of nine major fields in science. Furthermore, 10 of 11 disciplines within the Computing Technologies field met the benchmarks. Specific detailed forecast examples are given and evaluated, and a critical evaluation of the forecasting approach is also provided.", "Bloom's Taxonomy, an integral component of learning theory since its inception, describes cognitive skill levels in increasing complexity (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create). Considering Bloom's Taxonomy when writing learning objectives and lecture material, teaching residents at the workstation and creating multiple choice questions can increase an educator's effectiveness. The incorporation of higher Bloom levels aids in cultivating critical thinking skills vital to image interpretation and patient care, and becomes increasingly important as the radiologist's role evolves with the continued development of artificial intelligence. Following established tenets of multiple choice question writing, involving trainees in the question writing process, and incorporating audience response systems into lectures are all strategies in which higher Bloom level skills can be accomplished.", "Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) has become a cornerstone in the diagnostic process of the heart disease. Although the cardiac imaging with interventional procedures is responsible for approximately 40% of the cumulative effective dose in medical imaging, a relevant radiation dose reduction over the last decade was obtained, with the beginning of the sub-mSv era in CTCA. The main technical basis to obtain a radiation dose reduction in CTCA is the use of a low tube voltage, the adoption of a prospective electrocardiogram-triggering spiral protocol and the application of the tube current modulation with the iterative reconstruction technique. Nevertheless, CTCA examinations are characterized by a wide range of radiation doses between different radiology departments. Moreover, the dose exposure in CTCA is extremely important because the benefit-risk calculus in comparison with other modalities also depends on it. Finally, because anatomical evaluation not adequately predicts the hemodynamic relevance of coronary stenosis, a low radiation dose in routine CTCA would allow the greatest use of the myocardial CT perfusion, fractional flow reserve-CT, dual-energy CT and artificial intelligence, to shift focus from morphological assessment to a comprehensive morphological and functional evaluation of the stenosis. Therefore, the aim of this work is to summarize the correct use of the technical basis in order that CTCA becomes an established examination for assessment of the coronary artery disease with low radiation dose.", "The establishment of a chest pain center (CPC) is an important strategy to improve the treatment of urgent cardiovascular disease, especially acute myocardial infarction. In order to monitor and continuously improve the quality of diagnosis and treatment of CPCs, accurate records of key time points must be made in the diagnosis and treatment of fatal chest pain, which consumes tremendous manpower and resources. Our research combined the application of the Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, and other techniques, to establish a smart CPC that can automatically record key time points, which significantly reduced the workload of doctors with more reliable, unified, and traceable data. Our solution to the CPC should be a promising plan for future CPC construction.", "An early symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disturbance of the circadian rhythm that is associated with disrupted sleep/wake cycles.\nTo investigate if BMAL1, a key gene that drives the circadian cycle, is epigenetically regulated in brains in relation to longitudinal changes in cognition, sleep quality, and AD neuropathology.\nFrontal cortex tissues were acquired from the Manchester Brain Bank (N\u200a=\u200a96). DNA methylation at six CpG sites at the promoter of BMAL1, determined using bisulfite pyrosequencing, was tested for associations with Braak stage, CERAD score and Thal phase, longitudinal changes in cognition, sleep measurements and cross-section measures of depressive symptoms (BDI score).\nMethylation across all the CpGs strongly correlated with each other. We found increased CpG2 methylation with higher Braak (t(92), p\u200a=\u200a0.015) and CERAD (t(94), p\u200a=\u200a0.044) stages. No significance was found between longitudinal fluid intelligence, processing speed and memory tests, but methylation at CpG1 (r\u200a=\u200a0.20, p\u200a=\u200a0.05) and CpG4 (r\u200a=\u200a0.20, p\u200a=\u200a0.05) positively correlated with vocabulary. CpG2 positively correlated with cross-sectional fluid intelligence (r\u200a=\u200a0.20 p\u200a=\u200a0.05) and vocabulary (r\u200a=\u200a0.22 p\u200a=\u200a0.03). Though longitudinal analysis revealed no significance between sleep duration, midsleep and efficiency for any of the CpG sites, CpG3 (B\u200a=\u200a0.03, 95% CI, p\u200a=\u200a0.03) and CpG5 (B\u200a=\u200a0.04, 95% CI, p\u200a=\u200a0.01) significantly correlated with night wake. CpG4 correlated with depressive symptoms (B\u200a=\u200a-0.27, 95% CI, p\u200a=\u200a0.02).\nMethylation of BMAL1 associated with tau pathology, changes in cognitive measures, a measure of sleep and depressive symptoms, suggesting an involvement of the circadian cycle.", "Deep learning (DL), an emerging area of investigation in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, has markedly advanced over the past years. DL techniques are being applied to assist medical professionals and researchers in improving clinical diagnosis, disease prediction and drug discovery. It is expected that DL will help to provide actionable knowledge from a variety of 'big data', including metabolomics data. In this review, we discuss the applicability of DL to metabolomics, while presenting and discussing several examples from recent research. We emphasize the use of DL in tackling bottlenecks in metabolomics data acquisition, processing, metabolite identification, as well as in metabolic phenotyping and biomarker discovery. Finally, we discuss how DL is used in genome-scale metabolic modelling and in interpretation of metabolomics data. The DL-based approaches discussed here may assist computational biologists with the integration, prediction and drawing of statistical inference about biological outcomes, based on metabolomics data.", "The heritability of language and literacy skills increases from early-childhood to adolescence. The underlying mechanisms are little understood and may involve (a) the amplification of genetic influences contributing to early language abilities, and/or (b) the emergence of novel genetic factors (innovation). Here, we investigate the developmental origins of genetic factors influencing mid-childhood/early-adolescent language and literacy. We evaluate evidence for the amplification of early-childhood genetic factors for vocabulary, in addition to genetic innovation processes.\nExpressive and receptive vocabulary scores at 38\u00a0months, thirteen language- and literacy-related abilities and nonverbal cognition (7-13\u00a0years) were assessed in unrelated children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, Nindividuals \u00a0\u2264\u00a06,092). We investigated the multivariate genetic architecture underlying early-childhood expressive and receptive vocabulary, and each of 14 mid-childhood/early-adolescent language, literacy or cognitive skills with trivariate structural equation (Cholesky) models as captured by genome-wide genetic relationship matrices. The individual path coefficients of the resulting structural models were finally meta-analysed to evaluate evidence for overarching patterns.\nWe observed little support for the emergence of novel genetic sources for language, literacy or cognitive abilities during mid-childhood or early adolescence. Instead, genetic factors of early-childhood vocabulary, especially those unique to receptive skills, were amplified and represented the majority of genetic variance underlying many of these later complex skills (\u226499%). The most predictive early genetic factor accounted for 29.4%(SE\u00a0=\u00a012.9%) to 45.1%(SE\u00a0=\u00a07.6%) of the phenotypic variation in verbal intelligence and literacy skills, but also for 25.7%(SE\u00a0=\u00a06.4%) in performance intelligence, while explaining only a fraction of the phenotypic variation in receptive vocabulary (3.9%(SE\u00a0=\u00a01.8%)).\nGenetic factors contributing to many complex skills during mid-childhood and early adolescence, including literacy, verbal cognition and nonverbal cognition, originate developmentally in early-childhood and are captured by receptive vocabulary. This suggests developmental genetic stability and overarching aetiological mechanisms.", "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal loss, cognitive impairment, and aphasia. Aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptide in the brain is considered a key mechanism in the development of AD. In the past 20 years, many compounds have been developed to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation and accelerate its degradation. Platycladus orientalis seed is a traditional Chinese medicine used to enhance intelligence and slow aging. We previously found that Platycladus orientalis seed extract (EPOS) inhibited A\u03b2-peptide aggregation in the hippocampus and reduced cognitive deficits in 5\u00d7FAD mice. However, the mechanisms of these effects have not been characterized. To characterize the protective mechanisms of EPOS, we used a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL4176 model to perform Bioactivity-guided identification of active compounds. Four active compounds, comprising communic acid, isocupressic acid, imbricatolic acid, and pinusolide, were identified using 13C-and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, we showed that isocupressic acid inhibited A\u03b2 generation by modulating BACE1 activity via the GSK3\u03b2/NF-\u03baB pathway in HEK293-APPsw cells. These findings showed that EPOS reduced cognitive deficits in an AD model via modulation of the A\u03b2 peptide aggregation pathway.", "Access to medical data is central for conducting research on genomics. However, to tap these metadata (observable traits and phenotypes, diagnoses and medication, and labels), researchers must grapple with the complex and sensitive nature of the information. In this Perspective, we argue that, at this exciting time for genomics and artificial intelligence, several critical aspects of data generation, infrastructure and management are pillars of a modern data ecosystem. Many risks to privacy and many obstacles to medical research can be eliminated or mitigated by new secure data analytics. Finally, we discuss the potential consequences of medical data exiting the institutions and being managed by individuals. These shifts in data ownership have the potential for profound disruption and opportunity across many fields.", "The SPIRIT 2013 (The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting, by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there is a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes.The SPIRIT-AI extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component.

Its use will assist editors and peer-reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial.", "The COVID-19 pandemic affects all aspects of human life including their food consumption. The changes in the food production and supply processes introduce changes to the global dietary patterns.\nTo study the COVID-19 impact on food consumption process, we have analyzed two data sets that consist of food preparation recipes published before (69,444) and during the quarantine (10,009) period. Since working with large data sets is a time-consuming task, we have applied a recently proposed artificial intelligence approach called DietHub. The approach uses the recipe preparation description (i.e. text) and automatically provides a list of main ingredients annotated using the Hansard semantic tags. After extracting the semantic tags of the ingredients for every recipe, we have compared the food consumption patterns between the two data sets by comparing the relative frequency of the ingredients that compose the recipes.\nUsing the AI methodology, the changes in the food consumption patterns before and during the COVID-19 pandemic are obvious. The highest positive difference in the food consumption can be found in foods such as \"Pulses/ plants producing pulses\", \"Pancake/Tortilla/Outcake\", and \"Soup/pottage\", which increase by 300%, 280%, and 100%, respectively. Conversely, the largest decrease in consumption can be food for food such as \"Order Perciformes (type of fish)\", \"Corn/cereals/grain\", and \"Wine-making\", with a reduction of 50%, 40%, and 30%, respectively. This kind of analysis is valuable in times of crisis and emergencies, which is a very good example of the scientific support that regulators require in order to take quick and appropriate response.", "Atherosclerotic plaque tissue rupture is one of the leading causes of strokes. Early carotid plaque monitoring can help reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Manual ultrasound plaque classification and characterization methods are time-consuming and can be imprecise due to significant variations in tissue characteristics. We report a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based plaque tissue classification and characterization system.\nWe hypothesize that symptomatic plaque is hypoechoic due to its large lipid core and minimal collagen, as well as its heterogeneous makeup. Meanwhile, asymptomatic plaque is hyperechoic due to its small lipid core, abundant collagen, and the fact that it is often calcified. We designed a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system consisting of three kinds of deep learning (DL) classification paradigms: Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), Visual Geometric Group-16 (VGG16), and transfer learning, (tCNN). DCNN was 3-D optimized by varying the number of CNN layers and data augmentation frameworks. The DL systems were benchmarked against four types of machine learning (ML) classification systems, and the CADx system was characterized using two novel strategies consisting of DL mean feature strength (MFS) and a bispectrum model using higher-order spectra.\nAfter balancing symptomatic and asymptomatic plaque classes, a five-fold augmentation process was applied, yielding 1000 carotid scans in each class. Then, using a K10 protocol (trained to test the ratio of 90%-10%), tCNN and DCNN yielded accuracy (area under the curve (AUC)) pairs of 83.33%, 0.833 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and 95.66%, 0.956 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), respectively. DCNN was superior to ML by 7.01%. As part of the characterization process, the MFS of the symptomatic plaque was found to be higher compared to the asymptomatic plaque by 17.5% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). A similar pattern was seen in the bispectrum, which was higher for symptomatic plaque by 5.4% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). It took <2\u00a0s to perform the online CADx process on a supercomputer.\nThe performance order of the three AI systems was DCNN\u00a0>\u00a0tCNN\u00a0>\u00a0ML. Bispectrum-based on higher-order spectra proved a powerful paradigm for plaque tissue characterization. Overall, the AI-based systems offer a powerful solution for plaque tissue classification and characterization.", "Inner speech travels under many aliases: the inner voice, verbal thought, thinking in words, internal verbalization, \"talking in your head,\" the \"little voice in the head,\" and so on. It is both a familiar element of first-person experience and a psychological phenomenon whose complex cognitive components and distributed neural bases are increasingly well understood. There is evidence that inner speech plays a variety of cognitive roles, from enabling abstract thought, to supporting metacognition, memory, and executive function. One active area of controversy concerns the relation of inner speech to auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) in schizophrenia, with a common proposal being that sufferers of AVH misidentify their own inner speech as being generated by someone else. Recently, researchers have used artificial intelligence to translate the neural and neuromuscular signatures of inner speech into corresponding outer speech signals, laying the groundwork for a variety of new applications and interventions. This article is categorized under: Philosophy > Foundations of Cognitive Science Linguistics > Language in Mind and Brain Philosophy > Consciousness Philosophy > Psychological Capacities.", "A potentially organizing goal of the brain and cognitive sciences is to accurately explain domains of human intelligence as executable, neurally mechanistic models. Years of research have led to models that capture experimental results in individual behavioral tasks and individual brain regions. We here advocate for taking the next step: integrating experimental results from many laboratories into suites of benchmarks that, when considered together, push mechanistic models toward explaining entire domains of intelligence, such as vision, language, and motor control. Given recent successes of neurally mechanistic models and the surging availability of neural, anatomical, and behavioral data, we believe that now is the time to create integrative benchmarking platforms that incentivize ambitious, unified models. This perspective discusses the advantages and the challenges of this approach and proposes specific steps to achieve this goal in the domain of visual intelligence with the case study of an integrative benchmarking platform called Brain-Score.", "This paper introduces an intensive discussion for the dynamical model of the love triangle in both integer and fractional-order domains. Three different types of nonlinearities soft, hard, and mixed between soft and hard, are used in this study. MATLAB numerical simulations for the different three categories are presented. Also, a discussion for how the kind of personalities affects the behavior of chaotic attractors is introduced. This paper suggests some explanations for the complex love relationships depending on the impact of memory (IoM) principle. Lyapunov exponents, Kaplan-Yorke dimension, and bifurcation diagrams for three different integer-order cases show a significant dependency on system parameters. Hardware digital realization of the system is done using the Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A100T FPGA kit. Version 14.7 from the Xilinx ISE platform is used in both Verilog simulation and hardware implementation stages. The digital approach of such a system opens the door to predict the love relation after sensing the human personality. Also, this study will help in justifying more human emotions like happiness, panic, and fear accurately. Perhaps shortly, this study may combine with artificial intelligence to demonstrate Human-Computer interaction products.", "Accurate dietary assessment is needed in studies that include analysis of nutritional intake. Image-based dietary assessment apps have gained in popularity for assessing diet, which may ease researcher and participant burden compared to traditional pen-to-paper methods. However, few studies report the validity of these apps for use in research. Keenoa is a smartphone image-based dietary assessment app that recognizes and identifies food items using artificial intelligence and permits real-time editing of food journals.\nThis study aimed to assess the relative validity of an image-based dietary assessment app - Keenoa - against a 3-day food diary (3DFD) and to test its usability in a sample of healthy Canadian adults.\nWe recruited 102 participants to complete two 3-day food records. For 2 weeks, on 2 non-consecutive days and 1 weekend day, in random order, participants completed a traditional pen-to-paper 3DFD and the Keenoa app. At the end of the study, participants completed the System Usability Scale. The nutrient analyses of the 3DFD and Keenoa data before (Keenoa-participant) and after they were reviewed by dietitians (Keenoa-dietitian) were analyzed using analysis of variance. Multiple tests, including the Pearson coefficient, cross-classification, kappa score, % difference, paired t test, and Bland-Altman test, were performed to analyze the validity of Keenoa (Keenoa-dietitian).\nThe study was completed by 72 subjects. Most variables were significantly different between Keenoa-participant and Keenoa-dietitian (P<.05) except for energy, protein, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, and potassium. Significant differences in total energy, protein, carbohydrates, % fat, saturated fatty acids, iron, and potassium were found between the 3DFD and Keenoa-dietitian data (P<.05). The Pearson correlation coefficients between the Keenoa-dietitian and 3DFD ranged from .04 to .51. Differences between the mean intakes assessed by the 3DFD and Keenoa-dietitian were within 10% except for vitamin D (misclassification rate=33.8%). The majority of nutrients were within an acceptable range of agreement in the Bland-Altman analysis; no agreements were seen for total energy, protein, carbohydrates, fat (%), saturated fatty acids, iron, potassium, and sodium (P<.05). According to the System Usability Scale, 34.2% of the participants preferred using Keenoa, while 9.6% preferred the 3DFD.\nThe Keenoa app provides acceptable relative validity for some nutrients compared to the 3DFD. However, the average intake of some nutrients, including energy, protein, carbohydrates, % fat, saturated fatty acids, and iron, differed from the average obtained using the 3DFD. These findings highlight the importance of verifying data entries of participants before proceeding with nutrient analysis. Overall, Keenoa showed better validity at the group level than the individual level, suggesting it can be used when focusing on the dietary intake of the general population. Further research is recommended with larger sample sizes and objective dietary assessment approaches.", "Functional materials have spurred the advancement of soft robotics with the potential to perform safe interactions and adaptative functions in unstructured environments. The responses of functional materials under external stimuli lend themselves to programmable actuation and sensing, opening up new possibilities of robot design with built-in mechanical intelligence and unlocking new applications. Here, we review the development of stimuli-responsive functional materials particularly used for soft robotic systems. This review covers five representative types of soft stimuli-responsive functional materials, namely (i) dielectric elastomers, (ii) hydrogels, (iii) shape memory polymers, (iv) liquid crystal elastomers, and (v) magnetic materials, with focuses on their inherent material properties, working mechanisms, and design strategies for actuation and sensing. We also highlight the state-of-the-art applications of soft stimuli-responsive functional materials in locomotion robots, grippers and sensors. Finally, we summarize the current challenges and map out future trends for engineering next-generation functional materials for soft robotics.", "Imaging is a key technology in the early detection of cancers, including X-ray mammography, low-dose CT for lung cancer, or optical imaging for skin, esophageal, or colorectal cancers. Historically, imaging information in early detection schema was assessed qualitatively. However, the last decade has seen increased development of computerized tools that convert images into quantitative mineable data (radiomics), and their subsequent analyses with artificial intelligence (AI). These tools are improving diagnostic accuracy of early lesions to define risk and classify malignant/aggressive from benign/indolent disease. The first section of this review will briefly describe the various imaging modalities and their use as primary or secondary screens in an early detection pipeline. The second section will describe specific use cases to illustrate the breadth of imaging modalities as well as the benefits of quantitative image analytics. These will include optical (skin cancer), X-ray CT (pancreatic and lung cancer), X-ray mammography (breast cancer), multiparametric MRI (breast and prostate cancer), PET (pancreatic cancer), and ultrasound elastography (liver cancer). Finally, we will discuss the inexorable improvements in radiomics to build more robust classifier models and the significant limitations to this development, including access to well-annotated databases, and biological descriptors of the imaged feature data.See all articles in this CEBP Focus section, \"NCI Early Detection Research Network: Making Cancer Detection Possible.\"", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has penetrated the field of medicine, particularly the field of radiology. Since its emergence, the highly virulent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over 10 million people, leading to over 500,000 deaths as of July 1st, 2020. Since the outbreak began, almost 28,000 articles about COVID-19 have been published (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov); however, few have explored the role of imaging and artificial intelligence in COVID-19 patients-specifically, those with comorbidities. This paper begins by presenting the four pathways that can lead to heart and brain injuries following a COVID-19 infection. Our survey also offers insights into the role that imaging can play in the treatment of comorbid patients, based on probabilities derived from COVID-19 symptom statistics. Such symptoms include myocardial injury, hypoxia, plaque rupture, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, coronary thrombosis, encephalitis, ischemia, inflammation, and lung injury. At its core, this study considers the role of image-based AI, which can be used to characterize the tissues of a COVID-19 patient and classify the severity of their infection. Image-based AI is more important than ever as the pandemic surges and countries worldwide grapple with limited medical resources for detection and diagnosis.", "The heart is the most important muscular organ of the cardiovascular system, which pumps blood and circulates, supplying oxygen and nutrients to peripheral tissues. Zebrafish have been widely explored in cardiotoxicity research. For example, the zebrafish embryo has been used as a human heart model due to its body transparency, surviving several days without circulation, and facilitating mutant identification to recapitulate human diseases. On the other hand, adult zebrafish can exhibit the amazing regenerative heart muscle capacity, while adult mammalian hearts lack this potential. This review paper offers a brief description of the major methodologies used to detect zebrafish cardiac rhythm at both embryonic and adult stages. The dynamic pixel change method was mostly performed for the embryonic stage. Other techniques, such as kymography, laser confocal microscopy, artificial intelligence, and electrocardiography (ECG) have also been applied to study heartbeat in zebrafish embryos. Nevertheless, ECG is widely used for heartbeat detection in adult zebrafish since ECG waveforms' similarity between zebrafish and humans is prominent. High-frequency ultrasound imaging (echocardiography) and modern electronic sensor tag also have been proposed. Despite the fact that each method has its benefits and limitations, it is proved that zebrafish have become a promising animal model for human cardiovascular disease, drug pharmaceutical, and toxicological research. Using those tools, we conclude that zebrafish behaviors as an excellent small animal model to perform real-time monitoring for the developmental heart process with transparent body appearance, to conduct the in vivo cardiovascular performance and gene function assays, as well as to perform high-throughput/high content drug screening.", "Big data has become a central part of medical research, as well as modern life generally. \"Omics\" technologies include genomics, proteomics, microbiomics and increasingly other omics. These have been driven by rapid advances in laboratory techniques and equipment. Crucially, improved information handling capabilities have allowed concepts such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to enter the research world. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how quickly information can be generated and analyzed using such approaches, but also showed its limitations. This review will look at how \"omics\" has begun to be translated into clinical practice. While there appears almost limitless potential in using big data for \"precision\" or \"personalized\" medicine, the reality is that this remains largely aspirational. Oncology is the only field of medicine that is widely adopting such technologies, and even in this field uptake is irregular. There are practical and ethical reasons for this lack of translation of increasingly affordable techniques into the clinic. Undoubtedly, there will be increasing use of large data sets from traditional (e.g. tumor samples, patient genomics) and nontraditional (e.g. smartphone) sources. It is perhaps the greatest challenge of the health-care sector over the coming decade to integrate these resources in an effective, practical and ethical way.", "The aim of the study was to investigate cognitive outcomes at 6.5\u00a0years in children born very preterm, in relation to neonatal characteristics and 2.5-year neurodevelopment.\nA prospective cohort, with gestational age 22.3-31.9\u00a0weeks, born 2004-2007, were examined at 2.5\u00a0years with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) (n\u00a0=\u00a0100) and at 6.5\u00a0years with the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (n\u00a0=\u00a091).\nNeonatal factors independently related to 6.5-year outcome were gestational age, retinopathy of prematurity and treated persistent ductus arteriosus. The Bayley-III cognitive scores explained only 44% of the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient result at 6.5\u00a0years, and 22% of the children had Wechsler index results below -1 SD, indicating cognitive impairment, after average test results at 2.5\u00a0years. The relative risk to score below -1 SD on the Full-Scale IQ was 2.83 (95% CI 1.45-5.53) in children with gestational age below 28\u00a0weeks and 2.22 (95% CI 1.18-4.17) at gestational age 28-31\u00a0weeks.\nVery preterm infants born in the 2000s had increased risks for impaired cognition at 6.5\u00a0years, but individual predictions based on neonatal risks and 2.5-year test results were not enough to identify all high-risk children.", "Science and technology are modifying medicine at a dizzying pace. Although access in our country to the benefits of innovations in the area of devices, data storage and artificial intelligence are still very restricted, the advance of digital medicine offers the opportunity to solve some of the biggest problems faced by medical practice and public health in Mexico. The potential areas where digital medicine can be disruptive are accessibility to quality medical care, centralization of specialties in large cities, dehumanization of medical treatment, lack of resources to access evidence-supported treatments, and among others. This review presents some of the advances that are guiding the new revolution in medicine, discusses the potential barriers to implementation, and suggest crucial elements for the path of incorporation of digital medicine in Mexico.\nLa ciencia y la tecnolog\u00eda han modificado la medicina a un ritmo vertiginoso.

Pilot work has been done to demonstrate that these methods are useful to predict patient flow at individual centers, so that staffing models can be adapted to match workflow. Artificial intelligence has also been proven useful in the development of regional trauma systems as a tool to determine the optimal location of a new trauma center based on trauma-patient geospatial injury data and to minimize response times across the trauma network. Although the utility of artificial intelligence is apparent and proven in small pilot studies, its operationalization across the broader trauma system and trauma surgery space has been slow because of cost, stakeholder buy-in, and lack of expertise or knowledge of its utility. Nevertheless, as new trauma centers or systems are developed, or existing centers are retooled, machine learning and sophisticated analytics are likely to be important components to help facilitate decision-making in a wide range of areas, from determining bedside nursing and provider ratios to determining where to locate new trauma centers or emergency medical services teams.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers unprecedented opportunities and challenges for humanity. If AI can be positioned and leveraged correctly, it can rapidly accelerate progress on achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG #3: 'Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages'.

An ethical, transparent and responsible approach to AI development will result in AI translating data into contextually relevant knowledge, conclusions, and impactful actions.", "Temporal lobe encephaloceles (TE) are increasingly recognized as a cause of drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Improved recognition of these lesions offers an opportunity to treat them with a limited resection sparing the hippocampus. However, as they can be difficult to identify on imaging, additional clues pointing to the diagnosis can be helpful. We sought to understand the baseline cognitive/neuropsychological profile in patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy caused by encephaloceles compared with that caused by mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), a common entity in the differential diagnosis.\nNeuropsychological testing, including language (semantic and phonemic fluency and naming), verbal memory, intelligence quotient (IQ), and executive function measures were compared across two groups (five patients with left TE and five age- and gender-matched patients with left MTS). Other clinical variables related to cognition, including patient age, electroencephalographic characteristics, epilepsy duration, and factors related to antiseizure medication dosing, were also compared between groups.\nMore patients with left MTS had atypical language lateralization (3/5 with right-sided language in the group with MTS compared with 0/5 in the group with TE). Patients with MTS had significantly worse scores on the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) subscore of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS; p\u202f=\u202f0.026). General IQ was also worse in patients with MTS (p\u202f=\u202f0.028). There was a trend towards worse executive function in patients with MTS as measured on Trails B (p\u202f=\u202f0.096). Other measures related to language and verbal memory did not differ significantly between the groups nor did other relevant clinical variables, except epilepsy duration, which was significantly longer in patients with MTS (p\u202f=\u202f0.0001).\nThis pilot study demonstrates few significant differences between the groups with left MTS and TE surveyed. A higher rate of atypical language lateralization was noted in patients with left MTS. The higher baseline global IQ and VCI scores in patients with left TE compared with patients with MTS may be attributable to longer duration of epilepsy in patients with left MTS. Future work with a larger sample size will focus on establishing a unique neuropsychological profile related to epilepsy due to TE.", "Common factors are increasingly used to model the structure of psychopathology (\"p\"), personality (General Factor of Personality [GFP]), pathological personality (General Factor of Pathological Personality [GFPP]), and intelligence (\"g\"). Using 4 waves spanning ages 18-29 in a cohort of college students (baseline n = 489), this study used indicators of psychopathology, personality, pathological personality, and cognitive functioning to compare models that included Cognitive Functioning, p, GFP, GFPP, and a \"Big Everything\" factor (which included cross-domain measures as indicators). GFP, GFPP, and p exhibited substantial overlap, and the Big Everything factor accounted for considerable variance in psychopathology, personality, and pathological personality indicators. Only a self-report measure of cognitive functioning loaded significantly onto the Big Everything. This study highlights concerns in the pursuit of identifying and reifying common factors based on the modeling of residual variances and limitations of using factor modeling to determine the structure of psychologically relevant phenomena.

Retinal thinning has been described in parkinsonism as an early nonmotor feature. Scarce reports have addressed retinal thickness changes in GD.\nThe objectives of this study were to compare ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with GD with healthy control subjects, and to correlate it with the presence of parkinsonian features (PFs), clinical prodromal markers of parkinsonism, severity score index (SSI), and glucosylsphingosine (Lyso-GL-1).\nThis study included 48 AYAs with GD (11-29\u2009years), 11 with manifest PFs (Group 1) and 37 with no PFs (Group 2), and 48 matched healthy control subjects (Group 3). Age of GD onset, disease duration, medication history, history of constipation, SSI, and hematological assessment were done. Neurocognitive evaluation included Parts I, II, and III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Wechsler Adult and Intelligence Scale and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) scale, Munich Parasomnia Screening scale, and the olfactory dysfunction scale. Molecular analyses of the acid GBA gene and Lyso-GL-1 were done. Participants underwent full ophthalmological examination and optical coherence tomography with GCC thickness measurement.\nGCC was significantly thinner in Group 1 than in Groups 2 and 3 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas no significant difference was found between Groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.977). In addition, a significant interocular GCC thickness difference was found among the studied AYAs with GD (P = 0.007). GCC correlated positively with total intelligence quotient (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and negatively with Lyso-GL-1 (P = 0.019), UPDRS (P = 0.004), and BDI (P = 0.029), but not with SSI (P = 0.874), GD type (P = 0.85), or genotype (P = 0.842).

The main aim of this review article is to provide an overview of the most frequently used metrics for CT radiation dose characterization, discuss their strengths and limitations, and present patient dose assessment methods. Computed tomography dosimetry is still based on a CT dose index (CTDI) measured using 100-mm-long pencil ionization chambers and standard dosimetry phantoms (CTDI100). This dose index is easily measured but has important limitations. Computed tomography dose index underestimates the dose generated by modern CT scanners with wide beam collimation. Manufacturers should report corrected CTDI values in the consoles of CT systems. The size-specific dose estimate has been proposed to provide an estimate of the average dose at the center of the scan volume along the z-axis of a CT scan. Size-specific dose estimate is based on CTDI and conversion factors and, therefore, its calculation incorporates uncertainties associated with the measurement of CTDI. Moreover, the calculation of size-specific dose estimate is straightforward only when the tube current modulation is not activated and when the patient body diameter does not change considerably along the z-axis of the scan. Effective dose can be used to provide typical patient dose values from CT examinations, compare dose between modalities, and communicate radiogenic risks. In practice, effective dose has been used incorrectly, for example, to characterize a CT procedure as a low-dose examination. Organ or tissue doses, not effective doses, are required for assessing the probability of cancer induction in exposed individuals. Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful technique to estimate organ and tissue dose from CT. However, vendors should make available to the research community the required information to model the imaging process of their CT scanners. Personalized dosimetry based on Monte Carlo simulation and patient models allows accurate organ dose estimation. However, it is not user friendly and fast enough to be applied routinely. Future research efforts should involve the development of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to overcome drawbacks associated with the current equipment-specific and patient-specific dosimetry.", "Smoking-induced noncommunicable diseases (SiNCDs) have become a significant threat to public health and cause of death globally. In the last decade, numerous studies have been proposed using artificial intelligence techniques to predict the risk of developing SiNCDs. However, determining the most significant features and developing interpretable models are rather challenging in such systems. In this study, we propose an efficient extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) based framework incorporated with the hybrid feature selection (HFS) method for SiNCDs prediction among the general population in South Korea and the United States. Initially, HFS is performed in three stages: (I) significant features are selected by t-test and chi-square test; (II) multicollinearity analysis serves to obtain dissimilar features; (III) final selection of best representative features is done based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Then, selected features are fed into the XGBoost predictive model. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several existing baseline models. In addition, the proposed model also provides important features in order to enhance the interpretability of the SiNCDs prediction model. Consequently, the XGBoost based framework is expected to contribute for early diagnosis and prevention of the SiNCDs in public health concerns.", "During the last decade, modern machine learning has found its way into synthetic chemistry. Some long-standing challenges, such as computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP), have been successfully addressed, while other issues have barely been touched.

Thereby, specific risks of molecular machine learning (MML) are discussed. Furthermore, possible sustainable developments are suggested, such as explainable artificial intelligence (exAI) for synthetic chemistry. This Viewpoint will illuminate chances for possible newcomers and aims to guide the community into a discussion about current as well as future trends.", "Although endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is reported to be suitable for determining the layer from which subepithelial lesions (SELs) originate, it is difficult to distinguish gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) from non-GIST using only EUS images. If artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for the diagnosis of SELs, it should provide several benefits, including objectivity, simplicity, and quickness. In this pilot study, we propose an AI diagnostic system for SELs and evaluate its efficacy.\nThirty sets each of EUS images with SELs \u2265\u200920\u00a0mm or <\u200920\u00a0mm were prepared for diagnosis by an EUS diagnostic system with AI (EUS-AI) and three EUS experts. The EUS-AI and EUS experts diagnosed the SELs using solely the EUS images. The concordance rates of the EUS-AI and EUS experts' diagnoses were compared with the pathological findings of the SELs.\nThe accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for SELs <\u200920\u00a0mm were 86.3, 86.3, and 62.5%, respectively for the EUS-AI, and 73.3, 68.2, and 87.5%, respectively, for the EUS experts. In contrast, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for SELs \u2265\u200920\u00a0mm were 90.0, 91.7, and 83.3%, respectively, for the EUS-AI, and 53.3, 50.0, and 83.3%, respectively, for the EUS experts. The area under the curve for the diagnostic yield of the EUS-AI for SELs \u2265\u200920\u00a0mm (0.965) was significantly higher than that (0.684) of the EUS experts (P\u2009=\u20090.007).\nEUS-AI had a good diagnostic yield for SELs \u2265\u200920\u00a0mm.

Standardized interviews provided data on AUDs, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), other psychiatric diagnoses, and combat exposure. Overall, 148 veterans (38.1%) had no history of alcohol-related diagnoses, 151 veterans (38.9%) had a past AUD diagnosis that was not current at the second assessment point, and 89 veterans (22.9%) had a current AUD diagnosis at the second assessment. Less education, lower intelligence test scores, and misconduct were individual risk factors for AUDs, as were first-interview diagnoses of PTSD, antisocial personality disorder, generalized anxiety, and dysthymia, but not depression; these variables were all nonsignificant after controlling for combat exposure and PTSD. Multinomial regression was used to assess the relative contributions of combat exposure and PTSD to the course of AUDs. Combat exposure and PTSD had different patterns of association with AUDs whereby combat exposure, but not PTSD, was associated with a history of AUDs, odds ratio (OR) = 1.02, but not with current AUDs, whereas PTSD, but not combat exposure, was associated with current AUDs, OR = 3.37. Current numbing and avoidance symptoms were associated with current AUDs, OR = 4.48. The results do not support a mutual maintenance model of PTSD and AUDs but are consistent with a self-medication model, which suggests treatment for PTSD may have beneficial effects on AUDs.", "This manuscript is an accompanying resource of the original research article entitled \"Child development at 6 years after maternal cancer diagnosis and treatment during pregnancy\" and present data that compare the outcome of 6-year-old-children born to women diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy (with or without treatment during pregnancy) (study group) with children born after an uncomplicated pregnancy (control group). Oncological, obstetrical and neonatal data were collected. Neurodevelopment was examined by clinical evaluation and neuropsychological testing (including intelligence, attention and memory tests) and by general health and behavior questionnaires. Cardiac evaluation included electro- and echocardiography. Univariate analyses of covariance were used to investigate between-group differences. A subgroup analysis was performed in chemotherapy-exposed children versus controls and anthracycline-exposed versus controls. Additionally, the incidence of behaviour problems was compared to matched controls for children whose mothers died and for those with surviving mothers.", "Tonic pupil size and its variability are sensitive to cognitive abilities (such as fluid intelligence [Gf]) among individuals. The present study aimed to examine this relationship in a new sample set (i.e., adolescents aged 11-14\u2009years) with several important factors considered. We conducted two task-free tasks (the blank-screen viewing task and the scene viewing task) to measure tonic pupil size and its variability in 11-14-year-old adolescents with different Gf levels and preliminarily tested the role of task type and stimuli's luminance on this relationship. The results found that high-Gf adolescents showed smaller tonic pupil size in both tasks but showed larger variability of tonic pupil size in the blank-screen viewing task. Task type and stimuli's luminance could influence tonic pupil size and its variability in different ways. Cognitive and underlying neural mechanisms of these results are discussed to provide an explanation and suggestions for future studies.", "Optical endoscopy is the primary diagnostic and therapeutic tool for management of gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Most GI neoplasms arise from precancerous lesions; thus, technical innovations to improve detection and diagnosis of precancerous lesions and early cancers play a pivotal role in improving outcomes. Over the last few decades, the field of GI endoscopy has witnessed enormous and focused efforts to develop and translate accurate, user-friendly, and minimally invasive optical imaging modalities. From a technical point of view, a wide range of novel optical techniques is now available to probe different aspects of light-tissue interaction at macroscopic and microscopic scales, complementing white light endoscopy. Most of these new modalities have been successfully validated and translated to routine clinical practice. Herein, we provide a technical review of the current status of existing and promising new optical endoscopic imaging technologies for GI cancer screening and surveillance. We summarize the underlying principles of light-tissue interaction, the imaging performance at different scales, and highlight what is known about clinical applicability and effectiveness. Furthermore, we discuss recent discovery and translation of novel molecular probes that have shown promise to augment endoscopists' ability to diagnose GI lesions with high specificity. We also review and discuss the role and potential clinical integration of artificial intelligence-based algorithms to provide decision support in real time. Finally, we provide perspectives on future technology development and its potential to transform endoscopic GI cancer detection and diagnosis.", "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) have impacted many scientific fields including biomedical maging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established method in breast imaging with several indications including screening, staging, and therapy monitoring. The rapid development and subsequent implementation of AI into clinical breast MRI has the potential to affect clinical decision-making, guide treatment selection, and improve patient outcomes. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive picture of the current status and future perspectives of AI in breast MRI. We will review DL applications and compare them to standard data-driven techniques. We will emphasize the important aspect of developing quantitative imaging biomarkers for precision medicine and the potential of breast MRI and DL in this context. Finally, we will discuss future challenges of DL applications for breast MRI and an AI-augmented clinical decision strategy.", "In recent years, flexible and sensitive pressure sensors are of extensive interest in healthcare monitoring, artificial intelligence, and national security. In this context, we report the synthetic procedure of a three-dimensional (3D) metal-organic framework (MOF) comprising cadmium (Cd) metals as nodes and isoniazid (INH) moieties as organic linkers (CdI2-INH\u2550CMe2) for designing self-polarized ferroelectret-based highly mechano-sensitive skin sensors. The as-synthesized MOF preferentially nucleates the stable piezoelectric \u03b2-phase in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and also gives rise to a porous ferroelectret composite film. Benefiting from the porous structure of 3D MOFs, composite ferroelectret film-based ultrasensitive pressure sensor (mechano-sensitivity of 8.52 V/kPa within 1 kPa pressure range) as well as high-throughput ( power density of 32 \u03bcW/cm2) mechanical energy harvester (MEH) has been designed. Simulation-based finite element method (FEM) analysis indicates that the geometrical stress confinement effect within the interpore region of the ferroelectret structure synergistically influences the mechano-electrical property of the MEH. In addition, 143 pC/N (\u223c4.5 times higher than commercial piezoelectric PVDF films) piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33) magnitude and superior response time (tr \u223c 8 ms) of this composite ferroelectret film enable the detection of different physiological signals such as coughing, pronunciation, and gulping behavior, making it a promising candidate for early intervention of healthcare, which may play a significant role in accurate alert of influenza and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related symptoms. In addition, MEH enables the tracking of the subtle pressure change in the wrist pulse, indicating its usefulness in effective mechano-sensitivity. Since the cardiovascular signal is one of the vital parameters that can determine the on-going physiological conditions, the wireless transmission of the detected wrist pulse signal has been demonstrated. All of these features coupled with wireless data transmission indicate the promising application of MOF-assisted composite ferroelectret films in noninvasive real-time remote healthcare monitoring.", "The SPIRIT 2013 statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human-AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial.", "Research on the health effects of chemical mixtures has focused mainly on early life rather than adolescence, a potentially important developmental life stage.\nWe examined associations of a metal mixture with general cognition in a cross-sectional study of adolescents residing near ferromanganese industry, a source of airborne metals emissions.\nWe measured manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), and chromium (Cr) in hair, blood, urine, nails, and saliva from 635 Italian adolescents 10-14 years of age. Full-scale, verbal, and performance intelligence quotient (FSIQ, VIQ, PIQ) scores were assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III. Multivariable linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were used to estimate associations of the metal mixture with IQ. In secondary analyses, we used BKMR's hierarchical variable selection option to inform biomarker selection for Mn, Cu, and Cr.\nMedian metal concentrations were as follows: hair Mn, 0.08\u03bcg/g; hair Cu, 9.6\u03bcg/g; hair Cr, 0.05\u03bcg/g; and blood Pb, 1.3\u03bcg/dL. Adjusted models revealed an inverted U-shaped association between hair Cu and VIQ, consistent with Cu as an essential nutrient that is neurotoxic in excess. At low levels of hair Cu (10th percentile, 5.4\u03bcg/g), higher concentrations (90th percentiles) of the mixture of Mn, Pb, and Cr (0.3\u03bcg/g, 2.6\u03bcg/dL, and 0.1\u03bcg/g, respectively) were associated with a 2.9 (95% CI: -5.2, -0.5)-point decrease in VIQ score, compared with median concentrations of the mixture. There was suggestive evidence of interaction between Mn and Cu. In secondary analyses, saliva Mn, hair Cu, and saliva Cr were selected as the biomarkers most strongly associated with VIQ score.\nHigher adolescent levels of Mn, Pb, and Cr were associated with lower IQ scores, especially at low Cu levels. Findings also support further investigation into Cu as both beneficial and toxic for neurobehavioral outcomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6803.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms including deep learning have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in image-recognition tasks. Here, we utilized AI for monitoring the expression of underglycosylated mucin 1 (uMUC1) tumor antigen, a biomarker for ovarian cancer progression and response to therapy, using contrast-enhanced in vivo imaging. This was done using a dual-modal (magnetic resonance and near infrared optical imaging) uMUC1-specific probe (termed MN-EPPT) consisted of iron-oxide magnetic\u00a0nanoparticles (MN) conjugated to a uMUC1-specific peptide (EPPT) and labeled with a near-infrared fluorescent dye, Cy5.5. In vitro studies performed in uMUC1-expressing human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3/Luc and control uMUC1low ES-2 cells showed preferential uptake on the probe by the high expressor (n\u2009=\u20093, p\u2009<\u2009.05). A decrease in MN-EPPT uptake by SKOV3/Luc cells in vitro due to uMUC1 downregulation after docetaxel therapy was paralleled by in vivo imaging studies that showed a reduction in probe accumulation in the docetaxel treated group (n\u2009=\u20095, p\u2009<\u2009.05). The imaging data were analyzed using deep learning-enabled segmentation and quantification of the tumor region of interest\u00a0(ROI) from raw input MRI sequences by applying AI algorithms including a blend of Convolutional Neural Networks\u00a0(CNN) and Fully Connected Neural Networks. We believe that the algorithms used in this study have the potential to improve studying and monitoring cancer progression, amongst other diseases.", "Affecting computing is an artificial intelligence area of study that recognizes, interprets, processes, and simulates human affects. The user's emotional states can be sensed through electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) devices. Research in emotion recognition using these tools is a rapidly growing field with multiple inter-disciplinary applications. This article performs a survey of the pertinent scientific literature from 2015 to 2020. It presents trends and a comparative analysis of algorithm applications in new implementations from a computer science perspective. Our survey gives an overview of datasets, emotion elicitation methods, feature extraction and selection, classification algorithms, and performance evaluation. Lastly, we provide insights for future developments.", "In India, virtually, no study was aimed to develop a psychometrically valid and reliable questionnaire to assess the nutrition knowledge and practice among parents of children aged between 3 and 6 years.\nThe present study describes an evaluation of validity and reliability measures in a questionnaire designed for the assessment of nutrition knowledge among parents of children participating in a study finding relationship between physical growth and development and nonverbal intelligence quotient development being undertaken in a semi-urban area.\nThis was a cross-sectional school-based reliability and validity study.\nThis study was conducted in seven primary schools within the limits of Purba (East) Barddhaman district legislation, West Bengal, India.\nOne hundred and thirty-four parents of children aged 3-6 years were included in the study.\nThe final questionnaire consisted of 32 questions that were selected on the basis of content validity.

Internal reliability of each item as measured by Cronbach's \u03b1 of 0.87 was also significant.\nThe test comprises basic psychometric criteria of a valid and reliable 32-item knowledge questionnaire which further forms an instrument for measuring current scenario and interpreting changes associated with intervention work aiming improvement of dietary and nutrition knowledge-practice in the middle-to-low socioeconomic community.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) in the last decade centered primarily around digitizing and incorporating the large volumes of patient data from electronic health records. AI is now poised to make the next step in health care integration, with precision medicine, imaging support, and development of individual health trends with the popularization of wearable devices. Future clinical pediatric cardiologists will use AI as an adjunct in delivering optimum patient care, with the help of accurate predictive risk calculators, continual health monitoring from wearables, and precision medicine. Physicians must also protect their patients' health information from monetization or exploitation.", "The CONSORT 2010 (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomised trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency when evaluating new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes.The CONSORT-AI extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component.

Patients who attend general (ambulatory) practice with symptoms of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are invariably assessed by some sort of clinical decision rule (CDR). However, CDRs rely on a cluster of non-specific clinical observations. A narrative review of the literature was undertaken to ascertain the value of C reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing (POCT) to guide antibacterial prescribing in adult patients presenting to general practitioner (GP) practices with symptoms of RTI. Studies that were included were Cochrane reviews, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised trials, controlled before and after studies, cohort studies and economic evaluations. An overwhelming number of studies demonstrated that the use of CRP tests in patients presenting with RTI symptoms reduces index antibacterial prescribing. GPs and patients report a good acceptability for a CRP POCT and economic evaluations show cost-effectiveness of CRP POCT over existing RTI management in primary care. POCTs increase diagnostic precision for GPs in the better management of patients with RTI. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, patients will expect greater precision in diagnosing and managing their illnesses. Adopting systems that markedly reduce antibiotic consumption is a no-brainer for governments that are struggling to address the rise in AMR.", "The practice of medicine is changing rapidly as a consequence of electronic health record adoption, new technologies for patient care, disruptive innovations that breakdown professional hierarchies, and evolving societal norms. Collectively, these have resulted in the modification of the physician's role as the gatekeeper for health care, increased shift-based care, and amplified interprofessional team-based care. Technological innovations present opportunities as well as challenges. Artificial intelligence, which has great potential, has already transformed some tasks, particularly those involving image interpretation. Ubiquitous access to information via the Internet by physicians and patients alike presents benefits as well as drawbacks: patients and providers have ready access to virtually all of human knowledge, but some websites are contaminated with misinformation and many people have difficulty differentiating between solid, evidence-based data and untruths. The role of the future physician will shift as complexity in health care increases and as artificial intelligence and other technologies advance. These technological advances demand new skills of physicians; memory and knowledge accumulation will diminish in importance while information management skills will become more important. In parallel, medical educators must enhance their teaching and assessment of critical human skills (e.g., clear communication, empathy) in the delivery of patient care. The authors emphasize the enduring role of critical human skills in safe and effective patient care even as medical practice is increasingly guided by artificial intelligence and related technology, and they suggest new and longitudinal ways of assessing essential noncognitive skills to meet the demands of the future. The authors envision practical and achievable benefits accruing to patients and providers if practitioners leverage technological advancements to facilitate the development of their critical human skills.", "Agenesis of the corpus callosum is a rare congenital brain malformation that can be associated with other cerebral malformations and/or underlying genetic causes. Prenatal counseling is hampered due to the lack of reliable long-term data on neurodevelopmental outcome.\nSince 2010, a total of 23 children with agenesis of the corpus callosum (mean age 3.8\u00a0years, range 0.7 to 9.7\u00a0years) were registered in our ACC outpatient clinic and diagnosed in a standardized manner; the data were analyzed retrospectively. Prenatal and postnatal imaging, associated malformations, genetic and clinical findings, and psychological testing (Bayley Scales, Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children II, Snijders-Oomen Non-verbal Test, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale I-III) were included. The clinical outcome was classified as \"normal\" (intelligence quotient 85 to 115, unremarkable motor skills), \"moderate developmental delay\" (intelligence quotient 70 to 85, mild motor abnormalities), and \"severe developmental delay\" (intelligence quotient less than 70, severe movement disorder).\nIsolated corpus callosum malformation was diagnosed in 15 of 23 (65%), associated cerebral malformations in four of 23 (17%), and associated cerebral malformations plus intracranial cyst in four of 23 (17%) children. Prenatal diagnosis changed in nine of 23 (39%) cases. Overall, a normal outcome or moderate or severe developmental delay was present in 15 of 23 (65%) or five of 23 (22%) or three of 23 (13%) children, respectively. Also six of eight children with associated cerebral malformations showed normal outcome.\nOur findings support the notion that developmental outcome is favorable in about two-thirds of children with prenatally diagnosed agenesis of corpus callosum. However, the individual outcome in children with agenesis of corpus callosum is difficult to predict. Even children with correctly characterized phenotypes show a variety of outcomes, making prenatal counseling challenging.", "Early detection of sepsis is critical in clinical practice since each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with an increase in mortality due to irreversible organ damage. This study aimed to develop an explainable artificial intelligence model for early predicting sepsis by analyzing the electronic health record data from ICU provided by the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019.\nRetrospective observational study.\nWe developed our model on the shared ICUs publicly data and verified on the full hidden populations for challenge scoring.\nPublic database included 40,336 patients' electronic health records sourced from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (hospital system A) and Emory University Hospital (hospital system B). A total of 24,819 patients from hospital systems A, B, and C (an unidentified hospital system) were sequestered as full hidden test sets.\nNone.\nA total of 168 features were extracted on hourly basis. Explainable artificial intelligence sepsis predictor model was trained to predict sepsis in real time. Impact of each feature on hourly sepsis prediction was explored in-depth to show the interpretability. The algorithm demonstrated the final clinical utility score of 0.364 in this challenge when tested on the full hidden test sets, and the scores on three separate test sets were 0.430, 0.422, and -0.048, respectively.\nExplainable artificial intelligence sepsis predictor model achieves superior performance for predicting sepsis risk in a real-time way and provides interpretable information for understanding sepsis risk in ICU.", "The perception of digital-free tourism for developing character strengths was explored. A golden evidence triangle fusing the views of three respondent groups was established to assess trustworthy digital-free tourism-character strength linkages. Nine strengths were commonly acknowledged. They were distributed across a three-layer tiered model according to their relative importance. The strengths developed in digital-free tourism include: self-regulation, appreciation of beauty and excellence, social intelligence and open-mindedness for the core layer; vitality, love and perspective for the secondary layer; spirituality and creativity for the peripheral layer. The roles of each verified strength and the mechanisms for developing character strengths in digital-free tourism were captured in a three-stage travel narrative.", "Despite the increasing adoption of insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices, most people with type 1 diabetes do not achieve their glycemic goals1. This could be related to a lack of expertise or inadequate time for clinicians to analyze complex sensor-augmented pump data. We tested whether frequent insulin dose adjustments guided by an automated artificial intelligence-based decision support system (AI-DSS) is as effective and safe as those guided by physicians in controlling glucose levels. ADVICE4U was a six-month, multicenter, multinational, parallel, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial in 108 participants with type 1 diabetes, aged 10-21 years and using insulin pump therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT03003806). Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive remote insulin dose adjustment every three weeks guided by either an AI-DSS, (AI-DSS arm, n\u2009=\u200954) or by physicians (physician arm, n\u2009=\u200954). The results for the primary efficacy measure-the percentage of time spent within the target glucose range (70-180\u2009mg\u2009dl-1 (3.9-10.0\u2009mmol\u2009l-1))-in the AI-DSS arm were statistically non-inferior to those in the physician arm (50.2\u2009\u00b1\u200911.1% versus 51.6\u2009\u00b1\u200911.3%, respectively, P\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7). The percentage of readings below 54\u2009mg\u2009dl-1 (<3.0\u2009mmol\u2009l-1) within the AI-DSS arm was statistically non-inferior to that in the physician arm (1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4% versus 1.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9%, respectively, P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Three severe adverse events related to diabetes (two severe hypoglycemia, one diabetic ketoacidosis) were reported in the physician arm and none in the AI-DSS arm. In conclusion, use of an automated decision support tool for optimizing insulin pump settings was non-inferior to intensive insulin titration provided by physicians from specialized academic diabetes centers.", "The frequent occurrence of food safety incidents has given rise to unprecedented concern about food contamination issues for both consumers and the industry. Various contaminations in food pose serious threats to food safety and human health. Many detection methods were studied to address the challenge. Recently, biosensors relying on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-functionalized nanoparticles have been developed as an efficient and effective detection method. In the current review, the strategies for DNA assembly metal and metal oxide nanoparticles are elaborated, recent applications of the sensors based on DNA-functionalized nanoparticles in food contaminant detection are discussed. Pathogenic bacteria, heavy metal ions, mycotoxins, antibiotics, and pesticides are covered as food contaminants. Additionally, limitations and future trends of functionalized nanoparticles-based technology are also presented. The current review indicates that DNA-functionalized metal and metal oxide nanoparticles are a novel nanomaterial with unique biological and physical properties for developing electrochemical, fluorescent, colourimetric and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensors, etc. Compared with conventional detection techniques, DNA-functionalized metal and metal oxide nanoparticles have considerable advantages with high accuracy, high specificity, micro-intelligence, and low cost. Nevertheless, the stability of these sensors and the limitations of real-time detection are still under discussion. Therefore, more tolerant, portable, and rapid DNA sensors should be developed to better the real-time monitoring of harmful contaminants.", "Human gaze reveals a wealth of information about internal cognitive state.

We discuss future challenges and potential applications that work towards a common goal of human-centered artificial intelligence.", "Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss is associated with adverse outcomes in prostate cancer and has clinical potential as a prognostic biomarker. The objective of this work was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system for automated detection and localization of PTEN loss on immunohistochemically (IHC) stained sections. PTEN loss was assessed using IHC in two prostate tissue microarrays (TMA) (internal cohort, n\u2009=\u2009272 and external cohort, n\u2009=\u2009129 patients). TMA cores were visually scored for PTEN loss by pathologists and, if present, spatially annotated. Cores from each patient within the internal TMA cohort were split into 90% cross-validation (N\u2009=\u20092048) and 10% hold-out testing (N\u2009=\u2009224) sets. ResNet-101 architecture was used to train core-based classification using a multi-resolution ensemble approach (\u00d75, \u00d710, and \u00d720). For spatial annotations, single resolution pixel-based classification was trained from patches extracted at \u00d720 resolution, interpolated to \u00d740 resolution, and applied in a sliding-window fashion. A final AI-based prediction model was created from combining multi-resolution and pixel-based models. Performance was evaluated in 428 cores of external cohort. From both cohorts, a total of 2700 cores were studied, with a frequency of PTEN loss of 14.5% in internal (180/1239) and external 13.5% (43/319) cancer cores. The final AI-based prediction of PTEN status demonstrated 98.1% accuracy (95.0% sensitivity, 98.4% specificity; median dice score\u2009=\u20090.811) in internal cohort cross-validation set and 99.1% accuracy (100% sensitivity, 99.0% specificity; median dice score\u2009=\u20090.804) in internal cohort test set. Overall core-based classification in the external cohort was significantly improved in the external cohort (area under the curve\u2009=\u20090.964, 90.6% sensitivity, 95.7% specificity) when further trained (fine-tuned) using 15% of cohort data (19/124 patients). These results demonstrate a robust and fully automated method for detection and localization of PTEN loss in prostate cancer tissue samples. AI-based algorithms have potential to streamline sample assessment in research and clinical laboratories.", "This study aimed to correlate the results in the body balance exams with the reading assessments of 27 students, 16 girls and 11 boys, students of the third year of public elementary school, whose average age was 8.21 years.\nChildren with auditory, visual, language and nonverbal intelligence deficits were discarded. Body balance was evaluated with oculomotor tests of vectoelectronystagmography (VENG) and cervical and ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential. Reading of Isolated words, reading fluency and textual comprehension were evaluated.\nThe results obtained uniformly in most findings of the oculomotor tests showed no statistical difference between the right and left ear in the cervical and ocular VEMP, the reading of regular stimuli were statistically higher than the reading of irregular stimuli and pseudowords, there were no differences between the literal and inferential questions. Finally, a positive and significant correlation was found between vertical saccadic and irregular stimuli, and between horizontal pendular tracking and most reading evaluations. Ocular VEMP correlated with reading, except for inferential questions.\nThe main correlation between reading and VENG oculomotor tests was with horizontal pendular tracking, which evaluates the slow movement of the eyes in the horizontal direction, the same performed during reading. Correlation between ocular VEMP and reading was evidenced, indicating that the students with the best developed vestibular-ocular reflex presented better reading results.", "Computerization of health care is the only model to sustain safe health care in this COVID era particularly in overpopulated nations with limited health care providers/systems like India.

Deep learning, as a process of artificial intelligence (AI) is used in ophthalmology for data analysis, segmentation, automated diagnosis and possible outcome predictions. The association of deep learning and optical coherence tomography (OCT) technologies has proven reliable for the detection of retinal diseases and improving the diagnostic performance of the eye's posterior segment diseases. This review explored the possibility of implementing and using AI in establishing the diagnosis of retinal disorders. The benefits and limitations of AI in the field of retinal disease medical management were investigated by analyzing the most recent literature data. Furthermore, the future trends of AI involvement in ophthalmology were analyzed, as AI will be part of the decision-making regarding the scientific investigation, diagnosis and therapeutic management.", "(1) Background: Coronary angiography is considered to be the most reliable method for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. However, angiography is an invasive procedure that carries a risk of complications; hence, it would be preferable for an appropriate method to be applied to determine the necessity for angiography. The objective of this study was to compare support vector machine, na\u00efve Bayes and logistic regressions to determine the diagnostic factors that can predict the need for coronary angiography. These models are machine learning algorithms. Machine learning is considered to be a branch of artificial intelligence. Its aims are to design and develop algorithms that allow computers to improve their performance on data analysis and decision making. The process involves the analysis of past experiences to find practical and helpful regularities and patterns, which may also be overlooked by a human. (2) Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 1187 candidates for angiography referred to Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran from 2011 to 2012. A logistic regression, naive Bayes and support vector machine were applied to determine whether they could predict the results of angiography. Afterwards, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, AUC (area under the curve) and accuracy of all three models were computed in order to compare them. All analyses were performed using R 3.4.3 software (R Core Team; Auckland, New Zealand) with the help of other software packages including receiver operating characteristic (ROC), caret, e1071 and rminer. (3) Results: The area under the curve for logistic regression, na\u00efve Bayes and support vector machine were similar-0.76, 0.74 and 0.75, respectively. Thus, in terms of the model parsimony and simplicity of application, the na\u00efve Bayes model with three variables had the best performance in comparison with the logistic regression model with seven variables and support vector machine with six variables. (4) Conclusions: Gender, age and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were found to be the most important factors to predict the result of coronary angiography. The na\u00efve Bayes model performed well using these three variables alone, and they are considered important variables for the other two models as well. According to an acceptable prediction of the models, they can be used as pragmatic, cost-effective and valuable methods that support physicians in decision making.", "Postgraduate surgical training has undergone repeated reforms alongside changes in terms of employment. The broad structure of progression from Foundation years through core and specialist training to the award of a Certificate of Completion of Training is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Technological developments including robotics, genomics and artificial intelligence together with an extension of the surgical team are likely to alter dramatically the nature of surgery in the future. Surgical training will need to incorporate training in new technologies, including simulation, which will be provided in the workplace, academic institutions and commercial facilities. There will be greater emphasis on non-technical skills and human factors, especially in relation to the use of new technologies and working in wider teams, including non-medical staff. Genomics will play an increasing role in determining individualized patient care, with a need for surgeons to have an understanding of this field and communicate this to their patients. Surgical training will need to be suitably flexible in order to accommodate these developments, to allow more part-time working and portfolio careers, and to encourage recruitment and retention.", "Large-scale public datasets have been shown to benefit research in multiple areas of modern artificial intelligence. For decision-making research that requires human data, high-quality datasets serve as important benchmarks to facilitate the development of new methods by providing a common reproducible standard. Many human decision-making tasks require visual attention to obtain high levels of performance. Therefore, measuring eye movements can provide a rich source of information about the strategies that humans use to solve decision-making tasks. Here, we provide a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human actions with simultaneously recorded eye movements while humans play Atari video games. The dataset consists of 117 hours of gameplay data from a diverse set of 20 games, with 8 million action demonstrations and 328 million gaze samples. We introduce a novel form of gameplay, in which the human plays in a semi-frame-by-frame manner. This leads to near-optimal game decisions and game scores that are comparable or better than known human records. We demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset through two simple applications: predicting human gaze and imitating human demonstrated actions. The quality of the data leads to promising results in both tasks. Moreover, using a learned human gaze model to inform imitation learning leads to an 115% increase in game performance. We interpret these results as highlighting the importance of incorporating human visual attention in models of decision making and demonstrating the value of the current dataset to the research community. We hope that the scale and quality of this dataset can provide more opportunities to researchers in the areas of visual attention, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning.", "This is the introductory article for the special issue \"Technology-related knowledge, skills, and attitudes of pre- and in-service teachers\". It (1) specifies the concept of technology-related knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSA) of teachers, (2) presents how these KSA are currently assessed, and (3) outlines ways of fostering them among pre- and in-service teachers. The eight articles in the special issue are structured accordingly, and we demonstrate how they contribute to knowledge in these three areas. Moreover, we show how the afterword to the special issue widens the perspective on technology integration by taking into account systems and cultures of practice. Due to their quantitative empirical nature, the eight articles investigate technology at the current state of the art. However, the potential of artificial intelligence has not yet been fully exploited in education. We provide an outlook on potential developments and their implications on teachers' technology-related KSA. To this end, we introduce the concept of augmentation strategies.", "The multitude of multi-omics data generated cost-effectively using advanced high-throughput technologies has imposed challenging domain for research in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Data curation poses a significant challenge as different parameters, instruments, and sample preparations approaches are employed for generating these big data sets. AI could reduce the fuzziness and randomness in data handling and build a platform for the data ecosystem, and thus serve as the primary choice for data mining and big data analysis to make informed decisions. However, AI implication remains intricate for researchers/clinicians lacking specific training in computational tools and informatics. Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Certain cancers, such as pancreatic and gastric cancers, are detected only after they have reached their advanced stages with frequent relapses. Cancer is one of the most complex diseases affecting a range of organs with diverse disease progression mechanisms and the effectors ranging from gene-epigenetics to a wide array of metabolites. Hence a comprehensive study, including genomics, epi-genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, along with the medical/mass-spectrometry imaging, patient clinical history, treatments provided, genetics, and disease endemicity, is essential. Cancer Moonshot\u2120 Research Initiatives by NIH National Cancer Institute aims to collect as much information as possible from different regions of the world and make a cancer data repository. AI could play an immense role in (a) analysis of complex and heterogeneous data sets (multi-omics and/or inter-omics), (b) data integration to provide a holistic disease molecular mechanism, (c) identification of diagnostic and prognostic markers, and (d) monitor patient's response to drugs/treatments and recovery. AI enables precision disease management well beyond the prevalent disease stratification patterns, such as differential expression and supervised classification. This review highlights critical advances and challenges in omics data analysis, dealing with data variability from lab-to-lab, and data integration. We also describe methods used in data mining and AI methods to obtain robust results for precision medicine from \"big\" data. In the future, AI could be expanded to achieve ground-breaking progress in disease management.", "The Second International Symposium on One Health Research (ISOHR) was held in Guangzhou city, China on 23-24 November 2019. A transdisciplinary collaborative approach, One Health (OH), was the central theme of the symposium which brought together more than 260 experts, scholars and emerging researchers from human health, veterinary health, food safety, environmental health and related disciplines and sectors. More than 50 organizations including World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control (USA), and Queensland Government (Australia) participated in the symposium. Scholars, experts and emerging researchers, policy-makers and practitioners in their respective fields delivered over 50 presentations at the symposium, highlighting the collective vulnerability to some of the emerging health challenges the region was combating. These included emerging infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, climate change, food safety and the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. The Pearl River Declaration, emanated from the symposium, called for establishing a One Health Cooperation Network in the Southeast Asia-Pacific region with a vision to strengthen regional health security through sharing each other's knowledge and experience, and making investments in workforce development, scientific innovations such as vaccine research and development, sharing epidemic intelligence, risk identification, risk communication and appropriate response measures against emerging health threats.", "Anxiety and depression are common disabling comorbidities in cervical dystonia (CD) and may predispose to social withdrawal and social cognitive impairments. The relationship between social cognition and depressive/anxiety symptoms in CD is under-investigated.\nForty-six CD patients (40 women; mean\u00a0age \u00b1\u00a0SD, 55.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.84\u00a0years) were administered the following social cognition battery: Affect Naming, Prosody Face and Pair Matching subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV and Wechsler Memory Scale IV (social perception), reality-known and reality-unknown false belief reasoning tasks (theory of mind), Empathy Quotient and Social Norms Questionnaire 22 (social behaviour), alongside the Benton Facial Recognition Task (non-emotional facial discrimination). Alongside CD severity, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale measured depressive/anxiety comorbid diagnostic status and severity, and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale assessed social phobia. Social cognition tasks were standardized using published normative data and a cut-off of z\u00a0<\u00a0-1.5 for impairment.\nMore than 90% of our CD patients performed normally on social perception and social behaviour tests. Performance on impaired belief reasoning (theory of mind) was impaired in 10 of 46 (21.74%); five of 46 (10.87%) were impaired on the Empathy Quotient. Better performance on the Affect Naming task was associated with comorbid anxiety (\u03b72 \u00a0=\u00a00.09, medium-to-large effect size) and greater anxiety, depression and social phobia severity. Worse performance on the Empathy Quotient was associated with comorbid depression (\u03b72 \u00a0=\u00a00.11, medium-to-large effect size) and greater depression severity. CD patients had significantly more difficulties with fearful face identification (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nGreater social perception abilities in CD patients with more severe anxiety and depression suggest efficient modulation and self-adaptation of social cognitive skills.", "A challenge of chronic diseases that remains to be solved is how to liberate patients and medical resources from the burdens of long-term monitoring and periodic visits. Precise management based on artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise; however, a clinical application that fully integrates prediction and telehealth computing has not been achieved, and further efforts are required to validate its real-world benefits. Taking congenital cataract as a representative, we used Bayesian and deep-learning algorithms to create CC-Guardian, an AI agent that incorporates individualized prediction and scheduling, and intelligent telehealth follow-up computing. Our agent exhibits high sensitivity and specificity in both internal and multi-resource validation. We integrate our agent with a web-based smartphone app and prototype a prediction-telehealth cloud platform to support our intelligent follow-up system. We then conduct a retrospective self-controlled test validating that our system not only accurately detects and addresses complications at earlier stages, but also reduces the socioeconomic burdens compared to conventional methods. This study represents a pioneering step in applying AI to achieve real medical benefits and demonstrates a novel strategy for the effective management of chronic diseases.", "As already observed as early as 1967 by Ingvar and Risberg in their pioneering work, effects of practice of working memory on cerebral functions have been confirmed repeatedly in a number of neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Accordingly, initial performance gains are typically accompanied by increased cerebral activation, while consolidation of such performance gains goes along with a subsequent decrease in activation resembling an inverse U-shaped function. This observed pattern can be interpreted as an economization of cerebral functioning as tasks are being accomplished with relatively lower effort and may also apply to other cognitive domains. However, the economization of cerebral activation under training may depend on task difficulty and training characteristics on the one hand and individual factors, including age, intelligence, cognitive reserve, education, physical and mental health on the other. These findings bear important implications for the design of neuroimaging studies and stimulation protocols, in which similar tasks are routinely repeated.", "The Flynn effect describes an increase in intelligence quotient (IQ) in the general population of about 3 points per decade. While this effect is well established in healthy individuals, research exploring the link to brain pathologies is scarce. We investigated the Flynn effect in a German sample of 203 patients with epilepsy with left, right, and bilateral lesions. Intelligence quotient values were obtained using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales (WAIS) III and IV. Our results showed a stable Flynn effect with nearly no difference in adjusted full scale IQ (FSIQ) scores (0.02 IQ points) between the WAIS-III and WAIS-IV samples. There were no significant interactions between the side of pathology and corrected IQ values. Our sample showed a tendency towards performing worse in the WAIS-IV in three out of four subscales independently of the Flynn effect, pointing out methodological differences between the newer Wechsler editions. However, although patients with bilateral lesions performed worst across all subscales, they exhibited a similar pattern as patients with lesions in the left or right hemisphere, indicating that also more severe forms of brain pathologies can profit from the mechanisms behind the Flynn effect.", "Artificial intelligence (AI), also known as computer-aided diagnosis, is a technology that enables machines to process information and functions at or above human level and has great potential in gastrointestinal endoscopy applications. At present, the research on medical image recognition usually adopts the deep-learning algorithm based on the convolutional neural network. AI has been used in gastrointestinal endoscopy including esophagogastroduodenoscopy, capsule endoscopy, colonoscopy, etc. AI can help endoscopic physicians improve the diagnosis rate of various lesions, reduce the rate of missed diagnosis, improve the quality of endoscopy, assess the severity of the disease, and improve the efficiency of endoscopy. The diversity, susceptibility, and imaging specificity of gastrointestinal endoscopic images are all difficulties and challenges on the road to intelligence. We need more large-scale, high-quality, multicenter prospective studies to explore the clinical applicability of AI, and ethical issues need to be taken into account.", "The spread of COVID-19 has altered sport in Spain, forcing athletes to train at home. The objectives of the study were: (i) to compare training and recovery conditions before and during the isolation period in handball players according to gender and competitive level, and (ii) to analyse the impact of psychological factors during the isolation period. A total of 187 participants (66 women and 121 men) answered a Google Forms questionnaire about demographics, training, moods, emotional intelligence, and resilience sent using the snowball sampling technique. T-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare sport level and gender differences. Linear regressions were used to analyse the psychological influence on training. Handball players reduced training intensity (in the whole sample; p = 0.44), training volume (especially in professional female handball players; p < 0.001), and sleep quality (especially in professional male handball players; p = 0.21) and increased sleep hours (especially in non-professional female players; p = 0.006) during the isolation period. Furthermore, psychological factors affected all evaluated training and recovery conditions during the quarantine, except for sleep quantity. Mood, emotional intelligence, and resilience have an influence on physical activity levels and recovery conditions. In addition, training components were modified under isolation conditions at p < 0.001. We conclude that the COVID-19 isolation period caused reductions in training volume and intensity and decreased sleep quality. Furthermore, psychological components have a significant impact on training and recovery conditions.", "Confinement of atoms and molecules brings forth fascinating properties to chemical systems that are otherwise not known in the bulk. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and fullerenes are excellent hosts for probing the confinement effects. Herein, we explore the potential energy surfaces of large noble gas clusters, Ngn (Ng = He, Ne and Ar; n = 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50), in the confines of CNTs of various lengths. Our implementation involves integrating the continuum approximation for CNTs with the well-known swarm intelligence technique, particle swarm optimization (PSO), followed by a deterministic local optimization. Global search techniques such as PSO have been increasingly utilized in recent times to track down minimum energy configurations on highly rugged potential energy surfaces. Aside from the position vectors of the noble gas atoms, we have considered the radius of the CNTs as a design variable. Such an approach enabled us to predict the optimal CNT radii for the encapsulation of each of the clusters. Confined cluster geometries ranging from linear, zig-zag, and double-helical to spiral configurations are obtained on encapsulation, in sharp contrast to their bare cluster geometries. On increasing the CNT length, our approach yielded quasi-linear geometries, suggesting that the length of the CNTs plays a crucial role in determining the stable cluster configurations on confinement.", "New technologies based on artificial agents promise to change the next generation of autonomous systems and therefore our interaction with them. Systems based on artificial agents such as self-driving cars and social robots are examples of this technology that is seeking to improve the quality of people's life. Cognitive architectures aim to create some of the most challenging artificial agents commonly known as bio-inspired cognitive agents. This type of artificial agent seeks to embody human-like intelligence in order to operate and solve problems in the real world as humans do. Moreover, some cognitive architectures such as Soar, LIDA, ACT-R, and iCub try to be fundamental architectures for the Artificial General Intelligence model of human cognition. Therefore, researchers in the machine ethics field face ethical questions related to what mechanisms an artificial agent must have for making moral decisions in order to ensure that their actions are always ethically right. This paper aims to identify some challenges that researchers need to solve in order to create ethical cognitive architectures. These cognitive architectures are characterized by the capacity to endow artificial agents with appropriate mechanisms to exhibit explicit ethical behavior. Additionally, we offer some reasons to develop ethical cognitive architectures. We hope that this study can be useful to guide future research on ethical cognitive architectures.", "Attention, processing speed, executive functioning, and math difficulties are common in youth with sickle cell disease (SCD) with silent cerebral infarcts (SCI). This study investigated the cognitive underpinnings of math difficulties in children with SCD and SCI.\nYouth (n\u00a0=\u00a068) with SCD and SCI completed measures of attention [Digit Span forward (DSF); Conners Continuous Performance Test-Third Edition/Kiddie Conners Continuous Performance Test-Second Edition (CPT-3/KCPT-2)]; working memory [Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WPPSI-IV, WISC-IV, WISC-V, WAIS-IV), Working Memory Index (WMI), Digit Span backwards (DSB)]; processing speed [WPPSI-IV, WISC-IV, WISC-V, WAIS-IV Processing Speed Index (PSI)]; math reasoning [Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-Third Edition (WIAT-III) Mathematics composite (MC)]; and math fluency [WIAT-III Math Fluency composite (MF)] as part of a clinical neuropsychological evaluation. Parent ratings of attention and executive functioning were obtained [Behavior Assessment System for Children-Third Edition (BASC-3), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)].\nMC was positively correlated with WMI (r\u00a0=\u00a00.59, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00), PSI (r\u00a0=\u00a00.40, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), DSF (r\u00a0=\u00a00.29, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), DSB (r\u00a0=\u00a00.47, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and MF (r\u00a0=\u00a00.71, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Correlations between MC, sustained attention, and parent ratings were nonsignificant. The linear regression model using correlated variables was significant [F(4,51)\u00a0=\u00a08.29, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.39, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001]. WMI was the only significant variable within the model (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).\nWorking memory deficits account for significant variance in untimed mathematical performance in this population-consistent with other populations with white matter dysfunction. Interventions targeting both mathematics and working memory may be beneficial.", "This study aimed to explore how the type and visual modality of a recommendation agent's identity affect male university students' (1) self-reported responses to agent-recommended symbolic brand in evaluating the naturalness of virtual agents, human, or artificial intelligence (AI) and (2) early event-related potential (ERP) responses between text- and face-specific scalp locations. Twenty-seven participants (M = 25.26, SD = 5.35) whose consumption was more motivated by symbolic needs (vs. functional) were instructed to perform a visual task to evaluate the naturalness of the target stimuli. As hypothesized, the subjective evaluation showed that they had lower attitudes and perceived higher unnaturalness when the symbolic brand was recommended by AI (vs. human). Based on this self-report, two epochs were segmented for the ERP analysis: human-natural and AI-unnatural. As revealed by P100 amplitude modulation on visual modality of two agents, their evaluation relied more on face image rather than text. Furthermore, this tendency was consistently observed in that of N170 amplitude when the agent identity was defined as human. However, when the agent identity was defined as AI, reversed N170 modulation was observed, indicating that participants referred more to textual information than graphical information to assess the naturalness of the agent.", "Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a public health problem worldwide. Kidney transplantation (KT) is the best treatment for elderly patients' longevity and quality of life.\nThe primary endpoint was to compare elderly versus younger KT recipients by analyzing the risk covariables involved in worsening renal function, proteinuria, graft loss, and death one year after KT. The secondary endpoint was to create a robot based on logistic regression capable of predicting the likelihood that elderly recipients will develop worse renal function one year after KT.\nUnicentric retrospective analysis of a cohort was performed with individuals aged \u226560 and <60 years old. We analysed medical records of KT recipients from January to December 2017, with a follow-up time of one year after KT. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for elderly vs younger recipients, controlled for demographic, clinical, laboratory, data pre- and post-KT, and death.\n18 elderly and 100 younger KT recipients were included. Pretransplant immune variables were similar between two groups. No significant differences (P > 0.05) between groups were observed after KT on laboratory data means and for the prevalences of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, acute rejection, cytomegalovirus, polyomavirus, and urinary infections. One year after KT, the creatinine clearance was higher (P\u2009=\u20090.006) in youngers (70.9\u2009\u00b1\u200925.2\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m2) versus elderlies (53.3\u2009\u00b1\u200921.1\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m2). There was no difference in death outcome comparison. Multivariable analysis among covariables predisposing chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation <60\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m2 presented a statistical significance for age \u226560 years (P\u2009=\u20090.01) and reduction in serum haemoglobin (P\u2009=\u20090.03). The model presented goodness-fit in the evaluation of artificial intelligence metrics (precision: 90%; sensitivity: 71%; and F 1 score: 0.79).\nRenal function in elderly KT recipients was lower than in younger KT recipients. However, patients aged \u226560 years maintained enough renal function to remain off dialysis. Moreover, a learning machine application built a robot (Elderly KTbot) to predict in the elderly populations the likelihood of worse renal function one year after KT.", "Cell plasticity, also known as lineage plasticity is defined as the ability of a cell to reprogram and change its phenotype identity. Cell plasticity is context dependent and occurs during the development of an embryo, tissue regeneration, wound healing. However when deregulated and aberrant it also contributes to cancer initiation, progression, metastases and resistance to therapies. Tumors cells exhibit varying forms of cell plasticity in each stage of the disease to evade normal regulation as would have occurred in normal cell division and homeostasis. Current evidence demonstrates complex interplay between the genes, epigenes, tumor microenvironment and the EMT in cell reprogramming and cancer cell plasticity. Herein we present experimental evidence and evolving new developments in cell plasticity in cancer cells. Additionally \"Deregulated/aberrant/hijacked cell plasticity\" could be considered as an additional hallmark of a cancer. In the future, combining the advances in next generation sequencing and single cell RNA techniques with evolving AI (artificial intelligence) technologies such as deep learning techniques may predict the trajectories of cancer cells and assist in navigating through the complex intricacies of the cancers. A durable, precise, personalized oncologic treatment could be a reality.", "To determine the clinical utility of the Patient Health Questionnaire-Adolescent (PHQ-A) in screening for depressive disorders in adolescents following traumatic brain injury (TBI).\nRetrospective analysis of data collected as a part of routine clinical care over a period of 4 years.\nRegional rehabilitation facility.\nAdolescents (n = 101) with mild to moderate-severe TBI who were referred for an outpatient neuropsychological evaluation within 1 to 12 months postinjury.\nPHQ-A, PHQ-A_2 (2-item version), and Processing Speed Index (PSI) from the Wechsler scales of intelligence.\nBoth premorbid depressive disorder and PHQ-A scores predicted a postinjury diagnosis of depressive disorder, with a combined sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.59. PHQ-A_2 did not reach acceptable levels of sensitivity in predicting suicidal thoughts. PHQ-A scores did not add significantly to the prediction of PSI results after accounting for TBI severity.\nPHQ-A has clinical utility as a screening instrument for depressive disorders in outpatient adolescents with TBI when the cutoff for clinically significant concern is set at more than 4 and premorbid psychiatric history is also taken into account.", "The speed at which the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe and the accompanying need to rapidly disseminate knowledge have highlighted the inadequacies of the traditional research/publication cycle, particularly the slowness and the fragmentary access globally to manuscripts and their findings. Scholarly communication has slowly been undergoing transformational changes since the introduction of the Internet in the 1990s. The pandemic response has created an urgency that has accelerated these trends in some areas. The magnitude of the global emergency has strongly bolstered calls to make the entire research and publishing lifecycle transparent and open. The global scientific community has collaborated in rapid, open, and transparent means that are unprecedented. The general public has been reminded of the important of science, and trusted communication of scientific findings, in everyday life. In addition to COVID-19-driven innovation in scholarly communication, alternative bibliometrics and artificial intelligence tools will further transform academic publishing in the near future.", "We sought to determine if the links between and within the default mode network (DMN) and dorsal attention network (DAT) exhibited different conditions according to catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene polymorphism in relationship to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms.\nFifty-seven children with ADHD and 48 healthy controls (HCs) were administered an intelligence test, the Children's Depression Inventory, the Korean ADHD rating scale, and continuous performance test. Resting-state brain functional MRI scans were obtained, and COMT genotyping was performed to distinguish valine carriers and methionine homozygotes.\nCompared to controls, children with ADHD showed increased ADHD scale scores, increased visual commission errors, and increased functional connectivity (FC) within the DMN and DAT. Compared to all children with ADHD, children with the methionine homozygote and those who were valine carriers showed increased FC within the DMN and DAT and decreased FC between the DMN and DAT. FC within the DMN was also increased in HC valine carriers compared to HC children with the methionine homozygote, and in children with ADHD who were valine carriers compared to HC valine carriers.\nWe observed increased brain connectivity within the DMN and DAT and altered brain connectivity within and between the DMN and DAT associated with COMT polymorphism in children with ADHD.", "Angle closure glaucoma (ACG) is a more aggressive disease than open-angle glaucoma, where the abnormal anatomical structures of the anterior chamber angle (ACA) may cause an elevated intraocular pressure and gradually lead to glaucomatous optic neuropathy and eventually to visual impairment and blindness. Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) imaging provides a fast and contactless way to discriminate angle closure from open angle. Although many medical image analysis algorithms have been developed for glaucoma diagnosis, only a few studies have focused on AS-OCT imaging. In particular, there is no public AS-OCT dataset available for evaluating the existing methods in a uniform way, which limits progress in the development of automated techniques for angle closure detection and assessment. To address this, we organized the Angle closure Glaucoma Evaluation challenge (AGE), held in conjunction with MICCAI 2019. The AGE challenge consisted of two tasks: scleral spur localization and angle closure classification. For this challenge, we released a large dataset of 4800 annotated AS-OCT images from 199 patients, and also proposed an evaluation framework to benchmark and compare different models. During the AGE challenge, over 200 teams registered online, and more than 1100 results were submitted for online evaluation. Finally, eight teams participated in the onsite challenge. In this paper, we summarize these eight onsite challenge methods and analyze their corresponding results for the two tasks. We further discuss limitations and future directions. In the AGE challenge, the top-performing approach had an average Euclidean Distance of 10 pixels (10\u00a0\u00b5m) in scleral spur localization, while in the task of angle closure classification, all the algorithms achieved satisfactory performances, with two best obtaining an accuracy rate of 100%. These artificial intelligence techniques have the potential to promote new developments in AS-OCT image analysis and image-based angle closure glaucoma assessment in particular.", "CLOCK and PER2 genes have been implicated in sleep-wake cycle alterations and neurodegenerative diseases. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of CLOCK T3111C and PER2 C111G on cognitive functioning in subjective cognitive decline (SCD) patients and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients at the baseline of a longitudinal study, and the effect of these two polymorphisms on the progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) of the two groups.\nSixty-eight subjects (41 SCD and 27 MCI) who underwent clinical evaluation, neuropsychological assessment, CLOCK and PER2 genotyping at baseline and neuropsychological follow-up every 2\u00a0years for a mean time of 10\u00a0years were included. Subjects who developed AD (SCD-c and MCI-c) and non-converters (SCD-nc, MCI-nc) were considered.\nCLOCK T3111C was detected in 47% of cases (21 SCD, 11 MCI) and PER2 C111G in 19% of cases (eight SCD and five MCI). PER2 G carriers presented lower premorbid intelligence score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.049), fewer years of education (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and a lower frequency of family history of AD (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) than G non-carriers. MCI PER2 G carriers had worse performance in tests assessing memory, executive function, language and visuospatial abilities at baseline. During follow-up, two SCD and 15 MCI subjects progressed to AD: both of the SCD-c subjects presented the PER2 G allele, while none of the SCD PER2 G non-carriers converted to AD (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003).\nPER2 seems to have a role in cognitive reserve and cognition in SCD and MCI patients. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to assess the role of PER2 C111G on the risk of progression to AD.", "Insect colours assist in body protection, signalling, and physiological adaptations. Colours also convey multiple channels of information. These channels are valuable for species identification, distinguishing individual quality, and revealing ecological or evolutionary aspects of animals' life. During recent years, the emerging interest in colour research has been raised in social hymenopterans such as ants, wasps, and bees. These insects provide important ecosystem services and many of those are model research organisms. Here we review benefits that various colour types give to social insects, summarize practical applications, and highlight further directions. Ants might use colours principally for camouflage, however the evolutionary function of colour in ants needs more attention; in case of melanin colouration there is evidence for its interrelation with thermoregulation and pathogen resistance. Colours in wasps and bees have confirmed linkages to thermoregulation, which is increasingly important in face of global climate change. Besides wasps use colours for various types of signalling. Colour variations of well chemically defended social insects are the mimetic model for unprotected organisms. Despite recent progress in molecular identification of species, colour variations are still widely in use for species identification. Therefore, further studies on variability is encouraged. Being closely interconnected with physiological and biochemical processes, insect colouration is a great source for finding new ecological indicators and biomarkers. Due to novel digital imaging techniques, software, and artificial intelligence there are emerging possibilities for new advances in this topic. Further colour research in social insects should consider specific features of sociality.", "Over the past decades, both industry and academy have made enormous advancements in the field of intelligent vehicles, and a considerable number of prototypes are now driving our roads, railways, air and sea autonomously. However, there is still a long way to go before a widespread adoption. Among all the scientific and technical problems to be solved by intelligent vehicles, the ability to perceive, interpret, and fully understand the operational environment, as well as to infer future states and potential hazards, represent the most difficult and complex tasks, being probably the main bottlenecks that the scientific community and industry must solve in the coming years to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the vehicles (and, therefore, their future adoption). The great complexity and the almost infinite variety of possible scenarios in which an intelligent vehicle must operate, raise the problem of perception as an \"endless\" issue that will always be ongoing. As a humble contribution to the advancement of vehicles endowed with intelligence, we organized the Special Issue on Intelligent Vehicles. This work offers a complete analysis of all the mansucripts published, and presents the main conclusions drawn.", "NF1 children have cognitive disorders, especially in executive functions, visuospatial, and language domains, the pathophysiological mechanisms of which are still poorly understood.\nA correlation study was performed from neuropsychological assessments and brain MRIs of 38 NF1 patients and 42 controls, all right-handed, aged 8-12 years and matched in age and gender. The most discriminating neuropsychological tests were selected to assess their visuospatial, metaphonological and visuospatial working memory abilities. The MRI analyses focused on the presence and location of Unidentified Bright Objects (UBOs) (1), volume analysis (2) and diffusion analysis (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) (3) of the regions of interest including subcortical structures and posterior fossa, as well as shape analysis of subcortical structures (4). The level of attention, intelligence quotient, age and gender of the patients were taken into account in the statistical analysis. Then, we studied how diffusion and volumes parameters were associated with neuropsychological characteristics in NF1 children.\nNF1 children present different brain imaging characteristics compared to the control such as (1) UBOs in 68%, (2) enlarged total intracranial volume, involving all subcortical structures, especially thalamus, (3) increased MD and decreased FA in thalamus, corpus callosum and hippocampus. These alterations are diffuse, without shape involvement. In NF1 group, brain microstructure is all the more altered that volumes are enlarged. However, we fail to find a link between these brain characteristics and neurocognitive scores.\nWhile NF1 patients have obvious pathological brain characteristics, the neuronal substrates of their cognitive deficits are still not fully understood, perhaps due to complex and multiple pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disorder, as suggested by the heterogeneity observed in our study. However, our results are compatible with an interpretation of NF1 as a diffuse white matter disease.", "To assess the mandibular cortical width (MCW) and morphology of the mandibular inferior cortex (MIC) on panoramic views from a large sample of males and females in various age groups by using an automated morphometric grading system for assisting osteoporosis screening. Furthermore, possible predictors and concrete cut-off values to identify the risk for osteoporosis were evaluated.\nMCW, MIC, tooth loss (TL), and alveolar bone loss (ABL) were retrospectively evaluated in 700 panoramic images from dental patients in Hong Kong using commercially available software. To estimate possible predictors for identifying the risk of osteoporosis, age, TL, and ABL were evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for each gender separately.\nThe age groups 60s (sixties), 70s and 80s showed statistically significant gender differences. For example, a smaller MCW and more MIC Class 3 were found in females. Furthermore, females exhibited a statistically significant increase in TL in the age groups 50 years and above. In males, age, TL or ABL did not correlate with MCW, whereas in females it statistically significantly did. Meanwhile, the correlation between ABL and MCW and MIC was weak for both genders. Concrete cut-off values to identify patients at risk of osteoporosis were 60.15 years and 3.5 missing teeth in females, and 72.55 years in males.\nAge and tooth loss were related to MCW and MIC in the population investigated. An age of \u226560 as well as more than 3.5 teeth lost seem to be indicators for a risk of osteoporosis in Chinese females based on panoramic views using artificial-intelligence-based software.", "In this study, we developed the world's first artificial intelligence (AI) system that assesses the dysplasia of blood cells on bone marrow smears and presents the result of AI prediction for one of the most representative dysplasia-decreased granules (DG). We photographed field images from the bone marrow smears from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or non-MDS diseases and cropped each cell using an originally developed cell detector. Two morphologists labelled each cell. The degree of dysplasia was evaluated on a four-point scale: 0-3 (e.g., neutrophil with severely decreased granules were labelled DG3). We then constructed the classifier from the dataset of labelled images. The detector and classifier were based on a deep neural network pre-trained with natural images. We obtained 1797 labelled images, and the morphologists determined 134 DGs (DG1: 46, DG2: 77, DG3: 11). Subsequently, we performed a five-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the classifier. For DG1-3 labelled by morphologists, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were 91.0%, 97.7%, 76.3%, 99.3%, and 97.2%, respectively. When DG1 was excluded in the process, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 85.2%, 98.9%, 80.6%, and 99.2% and 98.2%, respectively.", "Maternal abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy may adversely affect offspring cognition and behaviour, but few prospective studies investigated this association at multiple points throughout childhood.\nWe hypothesised that maternal abnormal glucose tolerance is associated with child cognitive and behavioural outcomes in early and mid-childhood.\nWe examined the associations of maternal abnormal glucose tolerance at 26-28\u00a0weeks of pregnancy with offspring cognitive and behavioural scores in 1421 children in the Project Viva pre-birth cohort. In early (mean 3.3\u00a0years) and mid-childhood (mean 7.9\u00a0years), we measured child cognition using validated instruments, the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning, and the Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities (WRAVMA); we assessed parent- and teacher-rated behavioural outcomes with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Behavioural Rating Inventory of Executive Function. We used linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders (maternal race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI, intelligence, age, parity, smoking status, education, and household income at enrolment, in addition to child's sex and age at assessment).\nOf 1421 mothers, 69 (4.9%) had gestational diabetes mellitus, 43 (3.0%) impaired glucose tolerance, 122 (8.6%) isolated hyperglycaemia, and 1187 (83.5%) normal glucose tolerance. Offspring born to women with gestational diabetes mellitus had lower total WRAVMA scores (-3.09 points; 95% CI -6.12, -0.05) in early childhood compared with offspring of women with normal glucose tolerance. None of the abnormal glucose tolerance categories during pregnancy were associated with any of the cognitive outcomes (verbal, non-verbal, and visual motor scores) or behavioural measures in mid-childhood.\nChildren born to mothers who had gestational diabetes mellitus had slightly lower scores on one cognitive test in early childhood. We found no evidence to support that maternal abnormal glucose tolerance was associated with cognitive or behavioural development in mid-childhood.", "Adversarial attacks have been alerting the artificial intelligence community recently since many machine learning algorithms were found vulnerable to malicious attacks. This paper studies adversarial attacks on Broido and Clauset classification for scale-free networks to test its robustness in terms of statistical measures. In addition to the well-known random link rewiring (RLR) attack, two heuristic attacks are formulated and simulated: degree-addition-based link rewiring (DALR) and degree-interval-based link rewiring (DILR). These three strategies are applied to attack a number of strong scale-free networks of various sizes generated from the Barab\u00e1si-Albert model and the uncorrelated configuration model. It is found that both DALR and DILR are more effective than RLR in the sense that rewiring a smaller number of links can succeed in the same attack. However, DILR is as concealed as RLR in the sense that they both are introducing a relatively small change on several typical structural properties, such as the average shortest path-length, the average clustering coefficient, the average diagonal distance, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the degree distribution. The results of this paper suggest that to classify a network to be scale-free, one has to be very careful from the viewpoint of adversarial attack effects.", "Until vaccines and effective therapeutics become available, the practical solution to transit safely out of the current coronavirus disease 19 (CoVID-19) lockdown may include the implementation of an effective testing, tracing and tracking system. However, this requires a reliable and clinically validated diagnostic platform for the sensitive and specific identification of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report on the development of a de novo, high-resolution and comparative genomics guided reverse-transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. To further enhance the assay performance and to remove any subjectivity associated with operator interpretation of results, we engineered a novel hand-held smart diagnostic device. The robust diagnostic device was further furnished with automated image acquisition and processing algorithms and the collated data was processed through artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines to further reduce the assay run time and the subjectivity of the colorimetric LAMP detection. This advanced AI algorithm-implemented LAMP (ai-LAMP) assay, targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, showed high analytical sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. A total of ~200 coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-suspected NHS patient samples were tested using the platform and it was shown to be reliable, highly specific and significantly more sensitive than the current gold standard qRT-PCR. Therefore, this system could provide an efficient and cost-effective platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 in resource-limited laboratories.", "Identifying patients with heart failure at high risk for poor outcomes is important for patient care, resource allocation, and process improvement. Although numerous risk models exist to predict mortality, hospitalization, and patient-reported health status, they are infrequently used for several reasons, including modest performance, lack of evidence to support routine clinical use, and barriers to implementation. Artificial intelligence has the potential to enhance the performance of risk prediction models, but has its own limitations and remains unproved.", "To describe novel embryo features capable of predicting implantation potential as input data for an artificial neural network (ANN) model.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nUniversity-affiliated private IVF center.\nThis study included 637 patients from the oocyte donation program who underwent single-blastocyst transfer during two consecutive years.\nNone.\nThe research was divided into two phases. Phase 1 consisted of the description and analysis of the following embryo features in implanted and nonimplanted embryos: distance and speed of pronuclear migration, blastocyst expanded diameter, inner cell mass area, and trophectoderm cell cycle length. Phase 2 consisted of the development of an ANN algorithm for implantation prediction. Results were obtained for four models fed with different input data. The predictive power was measured with the use of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\nOut of the five novel described parameters, blastocyst expanded diameter and trophectoderm cell cycle length had statistically different values in implanted and nonimplanted embryos. After the ANN models were trained and validated using fivefold cross-validation, they were capable of predicting implantation on testing data with AUCs of 0.64 for ANN1 (conventional morphokinetics), 0.73 for ANN2 (novel morphodynamics), 0.77 for ANN3 (conventional morphokinetics + novel morphodynamics), and 0.68 for ANN4 (discriminatory variables from statistical test).\nThe novel proposed embryo features affect the implantation potential, and their combination with conventional morphokinetic parameters is effective as input data for a predictive model based on artificial intelligence.", "The growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis plays an important role in normal brain development, and GH deficiency inevitably affects the growth of the cerebral cortex. This study was designed to analyze morphological differences in gray matter volume, cortical surface area, and gray matter thickness between children with isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) and children with idiopathic short stature (ISS). Twenty-four children with IGHD (mean age 9.42\u00a0years, peak GH\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcg/l) and 24 controls with ISS (mean age 9.21\u00a0years, peak GH\u00a0>\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcg/l) were included. High-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted MRIs were acquired at participants' first visit. Measurements of gray matter volume, cortical surface area and gray matter thickness were obtained using FreeSurfer. The total and regional differences between groups were statistically analyzed. Correlations between the FreeSurfer results and GH and IGF-I levels were also obtained. The gray matter volume, cortical surface area and gray matter thickness of the total brain and of the bilateral hemispheres of children with IGHD were significantly smaller than those of children with ISS (all P values\u00a0<\u00a00.05). All the measurements had similar cortical distributions between groups but varied across regions. Cortical regions with significant differences in the mean gray matter volume and surface area were mainly distributed around the bilateral central sulci and the lateral and basal parts of the temporal lobes (all P values\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There were negative correlations between gray matter volume, cortical surface area and GH levels, and the right hemispheric and total cortical surface area correlated significantly with GH levels (all P values\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in children with IGHD. There were significant positive correlations between gray matter volume, cortical surface area and IGF-I levels (all P values\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in both groups, except for in left hemispheric gray matter volume in children with ISS. Children with IGHD have significant morphological changes in the cerebral cortex, which were partially influenced by GH and IGF-I levels. These cortical changes may be related to deficits in their relatively slower development in intelligence, motor performance, and other functions.", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fast-progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive physical immobility with usually normal or mild cognitive and/or behavioural involvement. Many patients are relatively young, instructed, sensitive to new technologies, and professionally active when developing the first symptoms. Older patients usually require more time, encouragement, reinforcement and a closer support but, nevertheless, selecting user-friendly devices, provided earlier in the course of the disease, and engaging motivated carers may overcome many technological barriers. ALS may be considered a model for neurodegenerative diseases to further develop and test new technologies. From multidisciplinary teleconsults to telemonitoring of the respiratory function, telemedicine has the potentiality to embrace other fields, including nutrition, physical mobility, and the interaction with the environment. Brain-computer interfaces and eye tracking expanded the field of augmentative and alternative communication in ALS but their potentialities go beyond communication, to cognition and robotics. Virtual reality and different forms of artificial intelligence present further interesting possibilities that deserve to be investigated. COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented opportunity to speed up the development and implementation of new technologies in clinical practice, improving the daily living of both ALS patients and carers. The present work reviews the current technologies for ALS patients already in place or being under evaluation with published publications, prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Whether regional anesthesia (RA) offers better long-term neurodevelopment outcomes compared to general anesthesia (GA) to infants undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy is still under heated debate. The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare the long-term neurodevelopment impact of RA with GA on infants undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy.\nA systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, clinicaltrials.gov and controlledtrials.com will be performed. Published eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs (including abstracts) through May 20, 2020 with language limit of English will be enrolled in the meta-analysis. Two reviewers will independently conduct the procedures of study selection, data extraction, methodological quality assessment, and risk of bias assessment. The primary outcome is long-term neurodevelopmental state (at 2- and 5-year follow-up) as reflected in the Bayley and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) scales of infants development following surgeries. The secondary outcomes consist of satisfactory intraoperative infants immobility, duration of surgery, any anesthetic failure, the supplement of postoperative analgesia, postoperative apnea, and postoperative bradycardia. The pooled weighted mean differences (WMDs) or odds ratios (ORs) of each outcome measurement and relative 95% confident intervals (CIs) will be calculated. EndNote X8 (Clarivate Analytics) software will be applied to manage all citations. The Cochrane Review Manager version 5.3 software (RevMan 5.3) will be employed for statistical analysis.\nThis study will summarize scientific and practical evidence and provide evidence-based individualized decision-making guidance on anesthesia regimen for inguinal herniorrhaphy in infants.\nThis protocol was registered with the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (INPLASY) on 17 June 2020 (registration number INPLASY202060064).", "As one of the most important tasks in protein structure prediction, protein fold recognition has attracted more and more attention. In this regard, some computational predictors have been proposed with the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. However, these existing computational methods are still suffering from some disadvantages. In this regard, we propose a new network-based predictor called ProtFold-DFG for protein fold recognition. We propose the Directed Fusion Graph (DFG) to fuse the ranking lists generated by different methods, which employs the transitive closure to incorporate more relationships among proteins and uses the KL divergence to calculate the relationship between two proteins so as to improve its generalization ability. Finally, the PageRank algorithm is performed on the DFG to accurately recognize the protein folds by considering the global interactions among proteins in the DFG. Tested on a widely used and rigorous benchmark data set, LINDAHL dataset, experimental results show that the ProtFold-DFG outperforms the other 35 competing methods, indicating that ProtFold-DFG will be a useful method for protein fold recognition. The source code and data of ProtFold-DFG can be downloaded from http://bliulab.net/ProtFold-DFG/download.", "Field research indicates that lower intelligence may predispose trauma-exposed individuals towards the development of re-experiencing symptoms. However, this assumption requires further testing in controlled prospective studies. In the current analog study, we tested whether lower fluid intelligence and lower working memory capacity (WMC) independently contribute to intrusion development. Moreover, we investigated potential mediating effects of trauma memory characteristics and trait rumination.\n118 healthy participants completed tests measuring fluid intelligence and WMC. Two days later, they were exposed to a film clip depicting traumatic events (i.e., so-called trauma film). After exposure to the film, intrusions were assessed using a diary and an intrusion triggering task.\nOur analyses revealed a negative correlation between fluid intelligence and intrusions during the intrusion triggering task. WMC did not correlate with any intrusion measure. Moreover, planned analyses did not yield any mediation effects.\nWe used the trauma film paradigm to examine analog posttraumatic stress symptoms. This approach limits the generalizability of our findings with regard to symptom development following real-life traumatic events.\nOur results show for the first time that higher fluid intelligence is associated with fewer intrusions of a trauma film. This association was evident for laboratory but not for ambulatory intrusions. By demonstrating this association using a prospective experimental design, our study importantly corroborates previous field research.", "To evaluate the relationship of caring behaviors with moral sensitivity, emotional intelligence and descriptive characteristics in intensive care nurses.\nDescriptive study. The sample of this study consisted of 156 nurses. The data were collected using introductory information form, caring behaviors inventory, moral sensitivity questionnaire, and emotional intelligence scale. The factors affecting caring behavior were determined using stepwise multiple linear regression.\nIt was determined that high education level, working in shifts, as well as appraisal of emotion subscale of emotional intelligence scale and also autonomy, expressing benevolence, and following praxis subscales of moral sensitivity questionnaire were high predictors for caring behaviors.\nDescriptive characteristics, moral sensitivity, and emotional intelligence are related to high caring behavior in intensive care nurses.", "The recognition of human activities is usually considered to be a simple procedure. Problems occur in complex scenes involving high speeds. Activity prediction using Artificial Intelligence (AI) by numerical analysis has attracted the attention of several researchers. Human activities are an important challenge in various fields. There are many great applications in this area, including smart homes, assistive robotics, human-computer interactions, and improvements in protection in several areas such as security, transport, education, and medicine through the control of falling or aiding in medication consumption for elderly people. The advanced enhancement and success of deep learning techniques in various computer vision applications encourage the use of these methods in video processing. The human presentation is an important challenge in the analysis of human behavior through activity. A person in a video sequence can be described by their motion, skeleton, and/or spatial characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel approach to human activity recognition from videos using the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for activity classification and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a new structure of the human skeleton to carry out feature presentation. The aims of this work are to improve the human presentation through the collection of different features and the exploitation of the new RNN structure for activities. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by the RGB-D sensor dataset CAD-60. The experimental results show the performance of the proposed approach through the average error rate obtained (4.5%).", "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are potentially devastating monoclonal deviations of hematopoiesis that lead to bone marrow dysplasia and variable cytopenias. Predicting severity of disease progression and likelihood to undergo acute myeloid leukemia transformation is the basis of treatment strategy. Some patients belong to a low-risk cohort best managed with conservative supportive care, whereas others are included in a high-risk cohort that requires decisive therapy with hematopoietic cell transplantation or hypomethylating agent administration. Risk scoring systems for MDS prognostication were traditionally based on karyotype characteristics and clinical factors readily available from chart review, and validation was typically conducted on de novo MDS patients. However, retrospective analysis found a large subset of patients incorrectly risk-stratified. In this review, the most commonly used scoring systems are evaluated, and pitfalls therein are identified. Emerging technologies such as personal genomics and machine learning are then explored for efficacy in MDS risk modeling. Barriers to clinical adoption of artificial intelligence-derived models are discussed, with focus on approaches meant to increase model interpretability and clinical relevance. Finally, a guiding set of recommendations is proposed for best designing an accurate and universally applicable prognostic model for MDS, which is supported by more than 20 years of observation of traditional scoring system performance, as well as modern efforts in creating hybrid genomic-clinical scoring systems.", "To explore nurses' experiences in natural disaster response.\nNurses are key to disaster response. There is a growing body of qualitative research exploring this emerging nursing issue. However, there is a need to synthesise and summarise this body of knowledge to identify the overarching elements of how nurses experience working in disaster situations to reflect on their experiences so that we may help shape future clinical practice, research and education.\nQualitative meta-synthesis.\nFollowing PROSPERO guidelines (Moher et al., 2015), an exhaustive and systematic literature search and quality appraisal was undertaken in December 2019 to reveal nurses' experiences during natural disaster response. Sandelowski and Barroso's systematic retrieval, analysis and interpretation of findings method was used to produce a meta-summary of findings from 10 papers evaluating experiences across 9 disasters. A meta-aggregation was used to synthesise the findings from the studies and was methodically quality assessed with PRISMA and CASP.\nOur findings aggregated data from 42 sub-themes, into the following four themes to capture nurses' experiences after responding to disasters. These included agile response; leadership and innovative problem solving; building resilience; positive communication and need for psychological/emotional support.\nThis meta-synthesis provides evidence to illustrate nurses' resilience and leadership capabilities as means to manage and perceive their disaster relief response. Factors such as emotional intelligence, capacity to react to changing situations, to manage scant resources in extreme situations were highlighted in nurses practising in highly stressful environments.\u00a0Managers can use these examples to support ways to improve disaster management policies, but also, to engage in support for their staff.\nThe role of nursing staff in disaster rescue is receiving significant attention. Understanding nurses' experiences during disaster rescue can help future leaders to improve capacity to respond and nursing preparedness through education, training and management, but also for continuing emotional support after the event.", "The relevant scientific literature has confirmed the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and mental health. In addition, previous studies have underlined the importance of perceived EI between family members in the construction of one's own EI. Adolescence is considered to be a crucial stage in identity construction and a time when mental health is vulnerable.\nTo analyze the mediating role of self-reported EI on mental health of adolescents and young adults still living in the family home, we considered the relationship between perceived EI in parents and children.\nThe sample was comprised of 170 children and their respective fathers and mothers living in the same family home. Self-reported EI was evaluated using the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24), whereas perceived EI was evaluated via the Perceived Emotional Intelligence Scale-24 (PTMM-24) and mental health using the MH-5.\nParents' perceived EI of their children also children's perceived EI of their parents has a direct effect on children's mental health and an indirect effect through the EI self-reported by children. We discuss the differences in the role of mothers and fathers in emotional education and its influence on the results.\nWe highlight the importance of perceived EI among family members, over and above the self-reported EI of each member, for its predictive power on the mental health of children.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising the way customers interact with brands. There is a lack of empirical research into AI-enabled customer experiences. Hence, this study aims to analyse how the integration of AI in shopping can lead to an improved AI-enabled customer experience. We propose a theoretical model drawing on the trust-commitment theory and service quality model. An online survey was distributed to customers who have used an AI- enabled service offered by a beauty brand. A total of 434 responses were analysed using partial least squares-structural equation modelling. The findings indicate the significant role of trust and perceived sacrifice as factors mediating the effects of perceived convenience, personalisation and AI-enabled service quality. The findings also reveal the significant effect of relationship commitment on AI-enabled customer experience. This study contributes to the existing literature by revealing the mediating effects of trust and perceived sacrifice and the direct effect of relationship commitment on AI-enabled customer experience. In addition, the study has practical implications for retailers deploying AI in services offered to their customers.", "The COVID-19 pandemic raises the question of strategic readiness for emergent pathogens. The current case illustrates that the cost of inaction can be higher in the future. The perspective article proposes a dedicated, government-sponsored agency developing anti-viral leads against all potentially dangerous pathogen species.\nThe author explores the methods of computational drug screening and in-silico synthesis and proposes a specialized government-sponsored agency focusing on leads and functioning in collaboration with a network of labs, pharma, biotech firms, and academia, in order to test each lead against multiple viral species. The agency will employ artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to cut the costs further. The algorithms are expected to receive continuous feedback from the network of partners conducting the tests.\nThe author proposes a bionic principle, emulating antibody response by producing a combinatorial diversity of high q uality generic antiviral leads, suitable for multiple potentially emerging species. The availability of multiple pre-tested agents and an even greater number of combinations would reduce the impact of the next outbreak. The methodologies developed in this effort are likely to find utility in the design of chronic disease therapeutics.", "Plants, and the biological systems around them, are key to the future health of the planet and its inhabitants. The Plant Science Decadal Vision 2020-2030 frames our ability to perform vital and far-reaching research in plant systems sciences, essential to how we value participants and apply emerging technologies. We outline a comprehensive vision for addressing some of our most pressing global problems through discovery, practical applications, and education. The Decadal Vision was developed by the participants at the Plant Summit 2019, a community event organized by the Plant Science Research Network. The Decadal Vision describes a holistic vision for the next decade of plant science that blends recommendations for research, people, and technology. Going beyond discoveries and applications, we, the plant science community, must implement bold, innovative changes to research cultures and training paradigms in this era of automation, virtualization, and the looming shadow of climate change. Our vision and hopes for the next decade are encapsulated in the phrase reimagining the potential of plants for a healthy and sustainable future. The Decadal Vision recognizes the vital intersection of human and scientific elements and demands an integrated implementation of strategies for research (Goals 1-4), people (Goals 5 and 6), and technology (Goals 7 and 8). This report is intended to help inspire and guide the research community, scientific societies, federal funding agencies, private philanthropies, corporations, educators, entrepreneurs, and early career researchers over the next 10 years. The research encompass experimental and computational approaches to understanding and predicting ecosystem behavior; novel production systems for food, feed, and fiber with greater crop diversity, efficiency, productivity, and resilience that improve ecosystem health; approaches to realize the potential for advances in nutrition, discovery and engineering of plant-based medicines, and \"green infrastructure.\" Launching the Transparent Plant will use experimental and computational approaches to break down the phytobiome into a \"parts store\" that supports tinkering and supports query, prediction, and rapid-response problem solving. Equity, diversity, and inclusion are indispensable cornerstones of realizing our vision. We make recommendations around funding and systems that support customized professional development. Plant systems are frequently taken for granted therefore we make recommendations to improve plant awareness and community science programs to increase understanding of scientific research. We prioritize emerging technologies, focusing on non-invasive imaging, sensors, and plug-and-play portable lab technologies, coupled with enabling computational advances. Plant systems science will benefit from data management and future advances in automation, machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence-assisted data integration, pattern identification, and decision making. Implementation of this vision will transform plant systems science and ripple outwards through society and across the globe. Beyond deepening our biological understanding, we envision entirely new applications. We further anticipate a wave of diversification of plant systems practitioners while stimulating community engagement, underpinning increasing entrepreneurship. This surge of engagement and knowledge will help satisfy and stoke people's natural curiosity about the future, and their desire to prepare for it, as they seek fuller information about food, health, climate and ecological systems.", "As a key component in artificial intelligence computing, a transistor design is updated here as a potential alternative candidate for artificial synaptic behavior implementation. However, further updates are needed to better control artificial synaptic behavior. Here, an updated channel-electrode transistor design is proposed as an artificial synapse device; this structure is different from previously published designs by other groups.\nA semiconductor characterization system was used in order to simulate the artificial synaptic behavior and a scanning electron microscope was used to characterize the device structure.\nIt was found that the electrode added to the transistor channel had a strong impact on the representative transmission behavior of such artificial synaptic devices, such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) and the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) index.\nThese behaviors were tuned effectively and the impact of the channel electrode is explained by the combined effects of the joint channel electrode and conventional gate. The voltage dependence of such oxide devices suggests more capability to emulate various synaptic behaviors for numerous medical and non-medical applications. This is extremely helpful for future neuromorphic computational system implementation.", "The paper shows the simulation of the behavior of a swarm of underwater drones (AUV) diffused in a closed section of the sea and inserted from a single starting point: Based on a few essential rules, we will see how their behavior evolves and how they manage to spread throughout the area assigned to them. In the first part of this work, after defining the design of the vehicle, we introduce our vision of the swarm, its problems, and its strengths. Later, we show how to spread a series of underwater drones with \"diffused intelligence\" (swarm) and its microscopic diffusion model. In the last part, we present the simulation that supports our approach to the swarm.", "To evaluate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to identify normal mammograms in a screening population.\nIn this retrospective study, 9581 double-read mammography screening exams including 68 screen-detected cancers and 187 false positives, a subcohort of the prospective population-based Malm\u00f6 Breast Tomosynthesis Screening Trial, were analysed with a deep learning-based AI system. The AI system categorises mammograms with a cancer risk score increasing from 1 to 10. The effect on cancer detection and false positives of excluding mammograms below different AI risk thresholds from reading by radiologists was investigated. A panel of three breast radiologists assessed the radiographic appearance, type, and visibility of screen-detected cancers assigned low-risk scores (\u2264 5). The reduction of normal exams, cancers, and false positives for the different thresholds was presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nIf mammograms scored 1 and 2 were excluded from screen-reading, 1829 (19.1%; 95% CI 18.3-19.9) exams could be removed, including 10 (5.3%; 95% CI 2.1-8.6) false positives but no cancers. In total, 5082 (53.0%; 95% CI 52.0-54.0) exams, including 7 (10.3%; 95% CI 3.1-17.5) cancers and 52 (27.8%; 95% CI 21.4-34.2) false positives, had low-risk scores. All, except one, of the seven screen-detected cancers with low-risk scores were judged to be clearly visible.\nThe evaluated AI system can correctly identify a proportion of a screening population as cancer-free and also reduce false positives. Thus, AI has the potential to improve mammography screening efficiency.\n\u2022 Retrospective study showed that AI can identify a proportion of mammograms as normal in a screening population. \u2022 Excluding normal exams from screening using AI can reduce false positives.", "Physiological signals can contain abundant personalized information and indicate health status and disease deterioration. However, in current medical practice, clinicians working in the general wards are usually lack of plentiful means and tools to continuously monitor the physiological signals of the inpatients. To address this problem, we here presented a medical-grade wireless monitoring system based on wearable and artificial intelligence technology. The system consists of a multi-sensor wearable device, database servers and user interfaces. It can monitor physiological signals such as electrocardiography and respiration and transmit data wirelessly. We highly integrated the system with the existing hospital information system and explored a set of processes of physiological signal acquisition, storage, analysis, and combination with electronic health records. Multi-scale information extracted from physiological signals and related to the deterioration or abnormality of patients could be shown on the user interfaces, while a variety of reports could be provided daily based on time-series signal processing technology and machine learning to make more information accessible to clinicians. Apart from an initial attempt to implement the system in a realistic clinical environment, we also conducted a preliminary validation of the core processes in the workflow. The heart rate veracity validation of 22 patient volunteers showed that the system had a great consistency with ECG Holter, and bias for heart rate was 0.04 (95% confidence interval: -7.34 to 7.42) beats per minute. The Bland-Altman analysis showed that 98.52% of the points were located between Mean\u2009\u00b1\u20091.96SD. This system has been deployed in the general wards of the Hyperbaric Oxygen Department and Respiratory Medicine Department and has collected more than 1000 cases from the clinic. The whole system will continue to be updated based on clinical feedback. It has been demonstrated that this system can provide reliable physiological monitoring for patients in general wards and has the potential to generate more personalized pathophysiological information related to disease diagnosis and treatment from the continuously monitored physiological data.", "The incidence of diabetes in the world is steadily increasing, and so is growing the number of cases of vision loss and blindness resulting from diabetic retinopathy (DR). This pathology is asymptomatic in the initial stages, but only the early treatment can be effective. In this regard, DR screening is an important and actual problem. This article reviews the principles, criteria, and problems of the currently run DR screening programs that are based on digital photography of the fundus. Special attention is paid to the displayed biomarkers and their role in DR screening. Various research methods are described, such as fluorescence angiography, optical coherence tomography, optical coherence tomography agniography, laser scanning ophthalmoscopy, which can be used to visualize pathological changes in the retina associated with DR. These changes were considered as potential screening biomarkers for DR. The review also describes new areas of screening based on telemedicine, artificial intelligence, and mobile photo-registering devices.\n\u0417\u0430\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0434\u0438\u0430\u0431\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432

reported various cognitive impairments in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, the neuropsychological profiles of adults with this disorder are understudied. Here, the intelligence and memory functions of adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder without intellectual disability were evaluated.\nThe Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised were administered to 30 adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder whose full-scale intelligence quotients were >85. Diagnoses were based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria. Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales-Self-Report-screening version and the Autism Spectrum Quotient were also evaluated.\nIn the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition, the verbal intelligence quotient was significantly higher than the performance intelligence quotient and the verbal comprehension score was the highest among the secondary indices. In the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, the visual memory score was the highest measure. Although the verbal intelligence quotient had no correlation with any Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised measures, the performance intelligence quotient was significantly correlated with the visual memory and attention scores of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales hyperactive-impulsive score was significantly correlated with the verbal intelligence quotient, whereas the inattention score was not correlated with any measures of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition or Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised.\nThe results suggest that while adults with normal-intelligence attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder have comparatively high verbal comprehension and social knowledge, their ability of information processing and visual-motor coordination are relatively weak.", "Salvia is a large, diverse, and polymorphous genus of the family Lamiaceae, comprising about 900 ornamentals, medicinal species with almost cosmopolitan distribution in the world. The success of Salvia limbata seed germination depends on a numerous ecological factors and stresses. We aimed to analyze Salvia limbata seed germination under four ecological stresses of salinity, drought, temperature and pH, with application of artificial intelligence modeling techniques such as MLR (Multiple Linear Regression), and MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron). The S.limbata seeds germination was tested in different combinations of abiotic conditions. Five different temperatures of 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C, seven drought treatments of 0, -2, -4, -6, -8, -10 and -12 bars, eight treatments of salinity containing 0, 50, 100.150, 200, 250, 300 and 350\u00a0mM of NaCl, and six pH treatments of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 were tested. Indeed 228 combinations were tested to determine the percentage of germination for model development.\nComparing to the MLR, the MLP model represents the significant value of R2 in training (0.95), validation (0.92) and test data sets (0.93). According to the results of sensitivity analysis, the values of drought, salinity, pH and temperature are respectively known as the most significant variables influencing S. limbata seed germination. Areas with high moisture content and low salinity in the soil have a high potential to seed germination of S. limbata. Also, the temperature of 18.3\u00a0\u00b0C and pH of 7.7 are proposed for achieving the maximum number of germinated S. limbata seeds.\nMultilayer perceptron model helps managers to determine the success of S.limbata seed planting in agricultural or natural ecosystems. The designed graphical user interface is an environmental decision support system tool for agriculture or rangeland managers to predict the success of S.limbata seed germination (percentage) in different ecological constraints of lands.", "Pathomics, the fusion of digitalized pathology and artificial intelligence, is currently changing the landscape of medical pathology and biologic disease classification. In this review, we give an overview of Pathomics and summarize its most relevant applications in urology.\nThere is a steady rise in the number of studies employing Pathomics, and especially deep learning, in urology. In prostate cancer, several algorithms have been developed for the automatic differentiation between benign and malignant lesions and to differentiate Gleason scores. Furthermore, several applications have been developed for the automatic cancer cell detection in urine and for tumor assessment in renal cancer. Despite the explosion in research, Pathomics is not fully ready yet for widespread clinical application.\nIn prostate cancer and other urologic pathologies, Pathomics is avidly being researched with commercial applications on the close horizon. Pathomics is set to improve the accuracy, speed, reliability, cost-effectiveness and generalizability of pathology, especially in uro-oncology.", "Screening for diabetic retinopathy is recommended for children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), yet screening rates remain low. Point-of-care diabetic retinopathy screening using autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) has become available, providing immediate results in the clinic setting, but the cost-effectiveness of this strategy compared with standard examination is unknown.\nTo assess the cost-effectiveness of detecting and treating diabetic retinopathy and its sequelae among children with T1D and T2D using AI diabetic retinopathy screening vs standard screening by an eye care professional (ECP).\nIn this economic evaluation, parameter estimates were obtained from the literature from 1994 to 2019 and assessed from March 2019 to January 2020. Parameters included out-of-pocket cost for autonomous AI screening, ophthalmology visits, and treating diabetic retinopathy; probability of undergoing standard retinal examination; relative odds of undergoing screening; and sensitivity, specificity, and diagnosability of the ECP screening examination and autonomous AI screening.\nCosts or savings to the patient based on mean patient payment for diabetic retinopathy screening examination and cost-effectiveness based on costs or savings associated with the number of true-positive results identified by diabetic retinopathy screening.\nIn this study, the expected true-positive proportions for standard ophthalmologic screening by an ECP were 0.006 for T1D and 0.01 for T2D, and the expected true-positive proportions for autonomous AI were 0.03 for T1D and 0.04 for T2D. The base case scenario of 20% adherence estimated that use of autonomous AI would result in a higher mean patient payment ($8.52 for T1D and $10.85 for T2D) than conventional ECP screening ($7.91 for T1D and $8.20 for T2D). However, autonomous AI screening was the preferred strategy when at least 23% of patients adhered to diabetic retinopathy screening.\nThese results suggest that point-of-care diabetic retinopathy screening using autonomous AI systems is effective and cost saving for children with diabetes and their caregivers at recommended adherence rates.", "Structural heart disease (SHD) is a new field within cardiovascular medicine. Traditional imaging modalities fall short in supporting the needs of SHD interventions, as they have been constructed around the concept of disease diagnosis. SHD interventions disrupt traditional concepts of imaging in requiring imaging to plan, simulate, and predict intraprocedural outcomes. In transcatheter SHD interventions, the absence of a gold-standard open cavity surgical field deprives physicians of the opportunity for tactile feedback and visual confirmation of cardiac anatomy. Hence, dependency on imaging in periprocedural guidance has led to evolution of a new generation of procedural skillsets, concept of a visual field, and technologies in the periprocedural planning period to accelerate preclinical device development, physician, and patient education. Adaptation of 3-dimensional (3D) printing in clinical care and procedural planning has demonstrated a reduction in early-operator learning curve for transcatheter interventions. Integration of computation modeling to 3D printing has accelerated research and development understanding of fluid mechanics within device testing. Application of 3D printing, computational modeling, and ultimately incorporation of artificial intelligence is changing the landscape of physician training and delivery of patient-centric care. Transcatheter structural heart interventions are requiring in-depth periprocedural understanding of cardiac pathophysiology and device interactions not afforded by traditional imaging metrics.", "Nearly 19.9 million cases and more than 730 thousand disease-related deaths have been confirmed in the months that followed WHO's assessment that the novel coronavirus COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan China on December 2019, could be characterized as a pandemic. The aforementioned coronavirus affected 188 countries as of 8.10.2020. Despite the continually increasing number of COVID-19 cases reported to CDC, at national level, the percentage of visits to outpatient providers and emergency departments has decreased and mortality rates attributed to COVID-19 have declined compared to the previous weeks, still above the baseline. It is common knowledge that the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped societies and economies around the globe, affecting all aspects of everyday life. Public health systems as a whole have been globally affected since they had to face extraordinary demands over a long period of time, which, in turn, required rapid adjustments in the operating procedures that were already in use, in order to provide high-standard health services, while respecting patients quality of life. Over half of deaths in low-income countries are caused by communicable diseases, maternal causes, conditions arising during pregnancy and childbirth, and nutritional deficiencies. On the contrary, this percentage is less than 7% in high-income countries. Noncommunicable diseases cause 71% of deaths globally, ranging from 37% in low-income countries to 88% in high-income countries. However, in terms of absolute number of deaths, 78% of global NCD deaths occurred in low-and middle-income countries. This partially explains why recent developments in medicine were mostly focused on chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and type 2 diabetes, rather than focusing on infection and inflammation progress. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent burden it placed upon health systems to deal with infectious and non-infectious diseases in a poor environment, can become an opportunity to update the field of medical research and change the governmental policies in place that have been stagnant and/or inefficient and ill-managed. This way, health systems will be equipped with better and faster protocols and best practices in order to manage efficiently any other pandemic that might emerge in the future. In this context, Nuclear Medicine departments should reconsider and update their practices, by altering routines and workflows in order to comply with the new sanitary standards, triaging their appointments, or introducing new diagnostic methods like Tele-Medicine / Tele Nuclear Medicine and Artificial Intelligence applications. This special edition of Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine has as its main purpose to introduce and communicate those new practices and protocols/standard operating procedures, in order for the scientific community, health public institutions, affected individuals and their families to be duly informed.", "Stimuli-responsive nanoparticles (NPs), so-called \"smart\" NPs, possess great potentials in drug delivery. Presently, the intelligence of smart NPs is mainly based on their chemical or physical changes to stimuli, which are usually \"mechanical\" and fundamentally different from biological intelligence. Inspired by mitochondria (MT), a biosmart nanoparticle with microenvironment targeting and self-adaptive capacity (MTSNP) was fabricated for ischemic tissue repair. The nanoparticles were designed as shell@circular DNA@shell@core. The double shells were like the two-layered membranes of MT, the melatonin-loaded cores corresponded to the MT matrix, and the circular DNA corresponded to MTDNA. In function, melatonin-loaded cores simulated the cell-protective mechanism of MT, which naturally synthesized melatonin to resist ischemia, while circular DNA was constructed to mimic the biological oxygen-sensing mechanism, synthesizing VEGF for vascularization according to oxygen level, like the ATP supply by MT according to microenvironment demand. At the acute stage of ischemia, melatonin was rapidly released from MTSNP to scavenge reactive oxygen species and activated melatonin receptor I on MT to prevent cytochrome c release, which would activate apoptosis. During the chronic stage, circular DNA could sense hypoxia and actively secrete VEGF for revascularization as a response. Importantly, circular DNA could also receive feedback of revascularization and shut down VEGF secretion as an adverse response. Then, the therapeutic potentials of the MTSNP were verified in myocardial ischemia by the multimodality of the methods. Such nanoparticles may represent a promising intelligent nanodrug system.", "To explore the influence of leader emotional intelligence on the working culture prevailing in teams that ultimately impacts nurses' intent to leave the job.\nGlobal shortages of nursing professionals have been concerning issues of extreme vitality in the delivery of superior services. Though the state-of-the-art system provides relief, the hospital management continued worrying about losing highly skilled nursing professionals due to a higher level of emotional exhaustion exhibiting progressive turnover.\nA survey technique was employed for data collection from nurses. Further data were analysed by structural equation modelling in the light of 313 substantial responses by using SmartPLS.\nThe findings revealed that leader emotional intelligence impulses critical constructive effects by fulfilling the needs of nurses and has an impact on their turnover intentions simultaneously.\nThe research provides an empirical lens of leadership and culture, which noticeably explain turnover intention. This study affirmed solid connections amongst the leader emotional intelligence, team culture and turnover intentions.\nThe study provides valuable insight for health management organisations to focus on factors that decrease the turnover intention of nurses. Considering a global shortage of nurses, nursing management must consider crucial aspects of the work environment and plan interventions to restrain nursing turnover intentions.", "Borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) is highly prevalent in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), but their relationship remains poorly understood. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the cognitive profile of BIF among people diagnosed with BPD. Clinical, demographic, and neuropsychological data of fifty-five outpatients with BPD were analyzed. The sample split into two groups: BPD with BIF (BIF+: n\u00a0=\u00a025; intelligence quotient - IQ - range: 71-84) and BPD without BIF (BIF-: n\u00a0=\u00a030; IQ range: 86-124). Between-group comparisons employed either parametric and non-parametric descriptive statistics, as necessary. Neuropsychological measures (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised - WAIS-R IQ, factor index, subtest scores) and cognitive performance deficits in the two groups were likewise compared aside, followed by Spearman's correlation test conducted on relevant metrics. The cognitive, but not the clinical and demographic profiles differed significantly between the two groups. BIF+ was associated with a specific pattern of verbal, attentive, and planning dysfunctions. The verbal comprehension index had the highest discriminative value for the presence of BIF in patients with BPD, and it was tightly associated with adaptive and social functioning. The neuropsychological assessment of BPD may be relevant to plan targeted interventions based on measures of cognitive functioning which could also serve to evaluate treatment efficacy and outcomes. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.", "Patients with shoulder pain were recruited in an outpatient rehabilitation clinic at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University from January 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018. These shoulder pain patients with or without limitation in joint movement can be included in the study. All of them received musculoskeletal ultrasound scanning. Demographic and imaging data including age, gender, duration of shoulder pain, pain side, and pathologies found by musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging were collected and analyzed. Patients were divided into three groups: <45 years (young group), between 45 and 60 years (middle-aged group), and >60 years (elderly group). The rates of various shoulder pathologies were evaluated and compared between the groups.\nThis study recruited a total of 346 patients with shoulder pain. There were more female (62.1%) than male patients (37.9%), with the largest number of patients in the 45-60 years of age group (40.5%). Forty-eight percent of patients had shoulder pain within a period of 3 months. A total of 380 shoulders were assessed using musculoskeletal ultrasound imaging. The occurrence rate of subacromial disorder (83.8%) was the highest. The rate of supraspinatus tendinopathy, acromioclavicular joint degeneration, and adhesive shoulder capsulitis varied significantly between age groups (P < 0.05). The rate of acromioclavicular joint degeneration was the highest in the elderly group followed by the middle-aged and young groups (P < 0.0167). The rate of supraspinatus tendinopathy and adhesive capsulitis in the middle-aged and elderly groups was significantly higher than that in the young group (P < 0.0167).\nMusculoskeletal ultrasound can be a useful imaging tool in making an accurate diagnosis of shoulder pain. The occurrence rates of different shoulder pain pathologies in all age groups were thoroughly calculated in this study. More female and more subcoracoid disorder patients than western countries are attributed to repetitive lifting in daily life and work in this study. Correlations between these pathologies and their associated images can be a solid foundation for the development of artificial intelligence in diagnosing the cause of shoulder pain.", "Members of stereotyped groups are vigilant to situational cues signaling threats to their social identity. In one psychophysiological experiment, we examined whether mere exposure to a watching male face would increase attentional vigilance among female STEM students due to the activation of math-gender stereotypes. Male and female students performed an alleged math intelligence task while being primed with male faces or control images. Automatic responses to errors were captured with error-related negativity (ERN), a neural index of error vigilance. Women showed larger ERN upon making errors when primed with male faces compared to control images, whereas no such priming effect occurred among men. Moreover, this face priming effect was pronounced only among women highly invested in pursuing STEM careers. These findings suggest that minimalistic social cues may activate negative stereotypes early in informational processing, thereby selectively shunting attention on errors in stereotype-relevant tasks among individuals invested in the performance domain.", "This is an observational prospective cohort study of cognition and mood in individuals presenting to a tertiary neurology clinic with first unprovoked seizure (FS), new-onset epilepsy (NOE), and newly diagnosed epilepsy (NDE). Our aim was to understand the cognitive profile of these three diagnostic groups at the time of first presentation. Follow-up was obtained to evaluate any association between cognition at presentation and subsequent clinical course.\nForty-three participants (age: 18-60\u202fyears) were recruited with FS (n\u202f=\u202f17), NOE (n\u202f=\u202f16), and NDE (n\u202f=\u202f10). Clinical details, neuropsychological testing, and screening for mood disorders were obtained at the time of presentation to clinic. Seizure recurrence was evaluated at clinic follow-up at least 6-12\u202fmonths following the initial presentation.\nIn all groups, general intelligence (intelligence quotient [IQ]) was consistent with population norms, but more than half of participants (55.8%) were impaired in at least one cognitive domain. The most commonly impaired domain in all diagnostic groups was visuospatial and visuoconstruction suggesting that it may be a sensitive marker of early cognitive impairment. Those with epilepsy (NOE and NDE) at initial presentation were more likely to be impaired than those with FS, particularly on tests of attention, working memory, and processing speed. Seven participants with FS converted to NOE (FSNOE) at follow-up. They were more likely to be impaired on tests of memory than those with FS who did not convert to NOE. On mood screening, 21% of participants scored moderate or severe for depressive symptoms, and 25.6% of participants scored moderate or severe for anxiety symptoms.\nCognitive impairment and mood changes are common at first seizure presentation and mirror the pattern seen in chronic epilepsy. This cooccurrence of symptomatology at disease onset prior to prolonged antiepilepsy drug exposure suggests a shared underlying disease mechanism and carries important clinical implications for effective diagnosis and management of epilepsy. Furthermore, early cognitive testing may become a clinical biomarker and enable the prediction of an individual's clinical course.", "Little information is currently available on interpersonal gait synchronization in overground walking. This is caused by difficulties in continuous gait monitoring over many steps while ensuring repeatability of experimental conditions. These challenges could be overcome by using immersive virtual reality (VR), assuming it offers ecological validity. To this end, this study provides some of the first evidence of gait coordination patterns for overground walking dyads in VR. Six subjects covered the total distance of 27 km while walking with a pacer. The pacer was either a real human subject or their anatomically and biomechanically representative VR avatar driven by an artificial intelligence algorithm. Side-by-side and front-to-back arrangements were tested without and with the instruction to synchronize steps. Little evidence of spontaneous gait coordination was found in both visual conditions, but persistent gait coordination patterns were found in the case of intentional synchronization. Front-to-back rather than side-by-side arrangement consistently yielded in the latter case higher mean synchronization strength index. Although the mean magnitude of synchronization strength index was overall comparable in both visual conditions when walking under the instruction to synchronize steps, quantitative and qualitative differences were found which might be associated with common limitations of VR solutions.", "Hospital readmissions are a key quality metric, which has been tied to reimbursement. One strategy to reduce readmissions is to direct resources to patients at the highest risk of readmission. This strategy necessitates a robust predictive model coupled with effective, patient-centered interventions.\nThe aim of this study was to reduce unplanned hospital readmissions through the use of artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support.\nA commercially vended artificial intelligence tool was implemented at a regional hospital in La Crosse, Wisconsin between November 2018 and April 2019. The tool assessed all patients admitted to general care units for risk of readmission and generated recommendations for interventions intended to decrease readmission risk. Similar hospitals were used as controls. Change in readmission rate was assessed by comparing the 6-month intervention period to the same months of the previous calendar year in exposure and control hospitals.\nAmong 2,460 hospitalizations assessed using the tool, 611 were designated by the tool as high risk. Sensitivity and specificity for risk assignment were 65% and 89%, respectively. Over 6 months following implementation, readmission rates decreased from 11.4% during the comparison period to 8.1% (p\u2009<\u20090.001). After accounting for the 0.5% decrease in readmission rates (from 9.3 to 8.8%) at control hospitals, the relative reduction in readmission rate was 25% (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Among patients designated as high risk, the number needed to treat to avoid one readmission was 11.\nWe observed a decrease in hospital readmission after implementing artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support. Our experience suggests that use of artificial intelligence to identify patients at the highest risk for readmission can reduce quality gaps when coupled with patient-centered interventions.", "COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in March 2020. By mid-August 2020, more than 21 million people have tested positive worldwide. Infections have been growing rapidly and tremendous efforts are being made to fight the disease. In this paper, we attempt to systematise the various COVID-19 research activities leveraging data science, where we define data science broadly to encompass the various methods and tools-including those from artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), statistics, modeling, simulation, and data visualization-that can be used to store, process, and extract insights from data. In addition to reviewing the rapidly growing body of recent research, we survey public datasets and repositories that can be used for further work to track COVID-19 spread and mitigation strategies. As part of this, we present a bibliometric analysis of the papers produced in this short span of time. Finally, building on these insights, we highlight common challenges and pitfalls observed across the surveyed works. We also created a live resource repository at https://github.com/Data-Science-and-COVID-19/Leveraging-Data-Science-To-Combat-COVID-19-A-Comprehensive-Review that we intend to keep updated with the latest resources including new papers and datasets.", "Empirical models have been an integral part of everyday clinical practice in ophthalmology since the introduction of the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK) formula. Recent developments in the field of statistical learning (artificial intelligence, AI) now enable an empirical approach to a\u00a0wide range of ophthalmological questions with an unprecedented precision.\nWhich criteria must be considered for the evaluation of AI-related studies in ophthalmology?\nExemplary prediction of visual acuity (continuous outcome) and classification of healthy and diseased eyes (discrete outcome) using retrospectively compiled optical coherence tomography data (50\u00a0eyes of 50\u00a0patients, 50\u00a0healthy eyes of 50\u00a0subjects). The data were analyzed with nested cross-validation (for learning algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization).\nBased on nested cross-validation for training, visual acuity could be predicted in the separate test data-set with a\u00a0mean absolute error (MAE, 95% confidence interval, CI of 0.142 LogMAR [0.077; 0.207]). Healthy versus diseased eyes could be classified in the test data-set with an agreement of 0.92 (Cohen's kappa). The exemplary incorrect learning algorithm and variable selection resulted in an MAE for visual acuity prediction of 0.229 LogMAR [0.150; 0.309] for the test data-set. The drastic overfitting became obvious on comparison of the MAE with the null model MAE (0.235 LogMAR [0.148; 0.322]).\nSelection of an unsuitable measure of the goodness-of-fit, inadequate validation, or withholding of a\u00a0null or reference model can obscure the actual goodness-of-fit of AI models. The illustrated pitfalls can help clinicians to identify such shortcomings.\nHINTERGRUND: Empirische Modelle sind seit Einf\u00fchrung der SRK(Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff)-Formel im klinischen Alltag der Augenheilkunde etabliert.

In order to update a global overview of R&D and the market, the authors conducted a literature search and drew on a competitive intelligence database. In order to understand Brazil's role in this context, with the Health Economic-Industrial Complex as the structural focus, the authors accessed information from the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, the National Immunization Program, and the Questel Orbit Intelligence database on patent protection in Brazil; identified the technologies transferred to public institutions in Brazil; and analyzed the trend in the trade balance deficit in health. The analysis revealed a global trend of concentration of vaccine production in a few leading pharmaceutical companies and the exacerbation of economic and technological asymmetries in the vaccine sector. In Brazil, the study identified technological weaknesses, risks, and manufacturing bottlenecks that impact the guarantee of immunizations in the country and showed that despite the installed industrial base, public policies and actions by domestic manufacturers have not been sufficient to confront and overcome the global context of structural dependence. In conclusion, the study indicates the need for progress in the Brazilian national strategy to link domestic production, technological capacity-building, and innovation in the vaccine sector to help guarantee universal access to health in Brazil.", "Emotional intelligence is an important skill for nurses and midwives and leads them to cleverly work in various fields and contexts, successfully handling colleagues, patients and their families. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the relationship between emotional intelligence, sociodemographic and academic variables in current and former master's degree students in nursing and midwifery, through the administration of a questionnaire to 71 subjects. Emotional intelligence is significantly related to gender. Females showed higher scores (0.2 points higher than men) for emotional intelligence factors, highlighting an excellent ability to \"evaluate and express emotions in relation to others\". Moreover, significant differences in academic performances are shown: both females and midwives demonstrated higher academic performance (a mean degree mark 3.8 points higher than men and a mean degree mark 2.6 point than nurses, respectively). High levels of emotional intelligence in individuals who carried out training activities in the organization area are also evident: These subjects have an ability regarding the \"regulation of emotion in the others\", which is significantly higher (p = 0.01) than those interested in other master's degree areas. Emotional intelligence (EI) is strongly linked to the individual's characteristics and their personalities and differs from technical and professional skills. EI is also an excellent predictor of professional success.", "Despite advancements in operative technique and improvements in postoperative managements, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is a life-threatening complication following pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). There are some reports to predict POPF preoperatively or intraoperatively, but the accuracy of those is questionable. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is being actively used in the medical field, but few studies have reported applying it to outcomes after PD.\nTo develop a risk prediction platform for POPF using an AI model.\nMedical records were reviewed from 1769 patients at Samsung Medical Center who underwent PD from 2007 to 2016. A total of 38 variables were inserted into AI-driven algorithms. The algorithms tested to make the risk prediction platform were random forest (RF) and a neural network (NN) with or without recursive feature elimination (RFE). The median imputation method was used for missing values. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to examine the discriminative power of algorithm for POPF prediction.\nThe number of POPFs was 221 (12.5%) according to the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula definition 2016. After median imputation, AUCs using 38 variables were 0.68 \u00b1 0.02 with RF and 0.71 \u00b1 0.02 with NN. The maximal AUC using NN with RFE was 0.74. Sixteen risk factors for POPF were identified by AI algorithm: Pancreatic duct diameter, body mass index, preoperative serum albumin, lipase level, amount of intraoperative fluid infusion, age, platelet count, extrapancreatic location of tumor, combined venous resection, co-existing pancreatitis, neoadjuvant radiotherapy, American Society of Anesthesiologists' score, sex, soft texture of the pancreas, underlying heart disease, and preoperative endoscopic biliary decompression. We developed a web-based POPF prediction platform, and this application is freely available at http://popfrisk.smchbp.org.\nThis study is the first to predict POPF with multiple risk factors using AI. This platform is reliable (AUC 0.74), so it could be used to select patients who need especially intense therapy and to preoperatively establish an effective treatment strategy.", "Adnexal masses are common, yet challenging, in gynecological practice. Making the differential diagnosis between their benign and malignant condition is essential for optimal surgical management, but reliable pre-surgical differentiation is sometimes difficult using clinical features, ultrasound examination, or tumor markers alone. A possible way to improve the diagnosis is using artificial intelligence (AI) or logistic models developed based on compiling and processing clinical, ultrasound, and tumor marker data together. Ample research has already been conducted in this regard that medical practitioners could benefit from. In this systematic review, we present logistic models and methods using AI, chosen based on their demonstrated high performance in clinical practice. Although some external validation of these models has been performed, further prospective studies are needed in order to select the best model or to create a new, more efficient, one for the pre-surgical evaluation of ovarian masses.", "Novel insight into suicidal behavior. This article presents four short examples of new insights into suicidal acts and innovative treatments. These include the results of cognitive neuroscience studies that have identified hypersensitivity to rejection, exclusion, and injustice signals in suicide attempters, as well as persisting trend for risky choices and insufficient cognitive control. These processes may be future therapeutic targets. Moreover, several studies showed on early suicidal trajectories, as well as residual epigenetic scars, as a result of childhood abuse. The people who were victims of these events may require specific intervention. In addition, artificial intelligence is a source of hope to account for the etiological and phenotypic complexity of suicidal behavior, and to establish more precise algorithms of medical decision-making. Ethical issues are raised at the same time. Finally, ketamine is today an innovative treatment (pending authorization) for the rapid reduction of suicidal ideation and a more effective crisis management.\nNouvelles perspectives sur les conduites suicidaires. Nous pr\u00e9sentons dans cet article quatre courts exemples de nouvelles pistes de compr\u00e9hension des actes suicidaires et de traitements innovants. Il s\u2019agit notamment des r\u00e9sultats des \u00e9tudes de neurosciences cognitives qui ont identifi\u00e9 une hypersensibilit\u00e9 aux signaux de rejet, d\u2019exclusion et d\u2019injustice chez les suicidants, ainsi qu\u2019une tendance persistante aux choix risqu\u00e9s et \u00e0 un contr\u00f4le cognitif insuffisant. Ces processus pourraient \u00eatre des cibles th\u00e9rapeutiques futures. Plusieurs \u00e9tudes ont en outre mis en \u00e9vidence les trajectoires suicidaires pr\u00e9coces ainsi que les cicatrices \u00e9pi g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques r\u00e9siduelles des maltraitances dans l\u2019enfance. Les personnes ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements pourraient n\u00e9cessiter des prises en charge particuli\u00e8res. Par ailleurs, l\u2019intelligence artificielle est une source d\u2019espoir pour rendre compte de la complexit\u00e9 \u00e9tiologique et ph\u00e9notypique des conduites suicidaires, et \u00e9tablir des algorithmes plus pr\u00e9cis de d\u00e9cision m\u00e9dicale. Des questions \u00e9thiques sont parall\u00e8lement soulev\u00e9es.

The aim of the study was to develop a technique and assess the accuracy and feasibility of lumbar vertebrae pedicle instrumentation using augmented reality-assisted surgical navigation.\nAn augmented reality and artificial intelligence (ARAI)-assisted surgical navigation system was developed. The system consists of a display system which hovers over the surgical field and projects three-dimensional (3D) medical images corresponding with the patient's anatomy. The system was registered to the cadaveric spine using an optical tracker and arrays with reflective markers. The virtual image overlay from the ARAI system was compared to 3D generated images from intraoperative scans and used to percutaneously navigate a probe to the cortex at the corresponding pedicle starting point. Intraoperative scan was used to confirm the probe position. Virtual probe placement was compared to the actual probe position in the bone to determine the accuracy of the navigation system.\nFour cadaveric thoracolumbar spines were used. The navigated probes were correctly placed in all attempted levels (n = 24 levels), defined as Zdichavsky type 1a, Ravi type I, and Gertzbein type 0. The virtual overlay image corresponded to the 3D generated image in all the tested levels.\nThe ARAI surgical navigation system correctly and accurately identified the starting points at all the attempted levels. The virtual anatomy image overlay precisely corresponded to the actual anatomy in all the tested scenarios. This technology may lead more uniform outcomes between surgeons and decrease minimally invasive spine surgery learning curves.", "It has been known since 1904 that, in humans, diverse cognitive traits are positively intercorrelated. This forms the basis for the general factor of intelligence (g). Here, we directly test whether there is a partial genetic basis for individual differences in g using data from seven different cognitive tests (n\u2009=\u200911,263-331,679) and genome-wide autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms. A genetic g factor accounts for an average of 58.4% (s.e.\u2009=\u20094.8%) of the genetic variance in the cognitive traits considered, with the proportion varying widely across traits (range, 9-95%). We distil genetic loci that are broadly relevant for many cognitive traits (g) from loci associated specifically with individual cognitive traits. These results contribute to elucidating the aetiology of a long-known yet poorly understood phenomenon, revealing a fundamental dimension of genetic sharing across diverse cognitive traits.", "Over millennia, natural evolution has allowed for the emergence of countless biomolecules with highly specific roles within natural systems. As seen with peptides and proteins, often evolution produces molecules with a similar function but with variable amino acid composition and structure but diverging from a common ancestor, which can limit sequence diversity. Using antimicrobial peptides as a model biomolecule, we train a generative deep learning algorithm on a database of known antimicrobial peptides to generate novel peptide sequences with antimicrobial activity. Using a variational autoencoder, we are able to generate a latent space plot that can be surveyed for peptides with known properties and interpolated across a predictive vector between two defined points to identify novel peptides that show dose-responsive antimicrobial activity. These proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the potential for artificial intelligence-directed methods to generate new antimicrobial peptides and motivate their potential application toward peptide and protein design without the need for exhaustive screening of sequence libraries.", "Health data financed by the French national solidarity system constitute a common heritage. Such data should be exploited to optimize care while complying with ethics and fundamental rights of citizens. The creation of the Health Data Hub (HDH) was allowed by the 24 July 2019 Law on the organization and transformation of the French health system. Its objective is to enable authorized innovative project leaders to access non-nominative data via a state-of-the-art secure technological platform. It appears to be one of the strong points of the French Artificial Intelligence strategy. This structure is a public interest group which associates 56 stakeholders, mostly from the public authorities. It implements, in partnership with the National Health Insurance Fund, the major strategic orientations relating to the National Health Data System set by the French State and the Ministry of Solidarity and Health. The Health Data Hub allows cross-reference of consolidated databases with SNDS data. Several use cases are under construction. The creation of relational databases in radiation oncology is also possible through specific strategies to get pseudonymized data from the various radiotherapy software programs upstream of the Health Data Hub.", "In this study we have investigated the problem of cost effective wireless heart health monitoring from a service design perspective.\nThere is a great medical and economic need to support the diagnosis of a wide range of debilitating and indeed fatal non-communicable diseases, like Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), Atrial Fibrillation (AF), diabetes, and sleep disorders. To address this need, we put forward the idea that the combination of Heart Rate (HR) measurements, Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI), forms a Heart Health Monitoring Service Platform (HHMSP). This service platform can be used for multi-disease monitoring, where a distinct service meets the needs of patients having a specific disease. The service functionality is realized by combining common and distinct modules. This forms the technological basis which facilitates a hybrid diagnosis process where machines and practitioners work cooperatively to improve outcomes for patients.\nHuman checks and balances on independent machine decisions maintain safety and reliability of the diagnosis. Cost efficiency comes from efficient signal processing and replacing manual analysis with AI based machine classification. To show the practicality of the proposed service platform, we have implemented an AF monitoring service.\nHaving common modules allows us to harvest the economies of scale. That is an advantage, because the fixed cost for the infrastructure is shared among a large group of customers. Distinct modules define which AI models are used and how the communication with practitioners, caregivers and patients is handled. That makes the proposed HHMSP agile enough to address safety, reliability and functionality needs from healthcare providers.", "To investigate the underlying mechanism of the relationship between visual working memory (VWM) and Chinese character recognition, and the moderation effect of processing efficiency on this relationship, 154 first-grade students were administered a battery of tasks for VWM, rapid temporal processing, and Chinese character reading. In the VWM task, the children were asked to remember the jumping routes of a frog and report these routes in reverse sequence. The longest span for which each participant could respond correctly at least four times out of six was the VWM index. In the task of temporal order judgement, the participants were asked to select which of two balls was presented first, with stimulus onset asynchronies varying from 8 to 492 ms according to an adaptive psychophysical procedure. Visual temporal order threshold (VTOT) was utilized as an indicator of processing efficiency. The participants were asked to read 100 characters aloud to measure their word-level reading abilities in Chinese character recognition. After controlling age, non-verbal intelligence, visual short-term memory, morphological awareness, and orthographic awareness, the results of a moderation effect analysis showed that (1) both VWM and visual VTOT predicted Chinese character reading, and (2) the moderation effect of VTOT on the VWM-reading link was significant (p = 0.001). The correlation between VWM and Chinese character reading was positive and significant when VTOTs were above average (i.e., smaller than 87.14 ms); however, the correlation was negative at relatively poor levels of VTOTs (i.e., larger than 231.44 ms).", "General practice is now completely computerised yet still largely reflects the habits and culture of the paper records that these computer programs have replaced. Technology is advancing rapidly,\u00a0and computers are poised to start\u00a0interacting (or intruding) in the consultation in new ways that practitioners (GPs) will once again need\u00a0to understand and integrate.\nThe aim of this article is to describe the\u00a0developing trends in computing, data\u00a0and intelligence, and demonstrate to GPs how to best use the examination room computer to enhance care of patients, prepare for upcoming revolutionary changes and continue to\u00a0connect with patients.\nUsing two real-world examples, this article explains the complexity of the changing environment and implications for the patient-doctor relationship, and offers guidance for change.", "Air pollution has a negative impact on one's health and on the central nervous system. We decided to assess studies that evaluated the relationship between air pollution and cognitive functions in children and adolescents by reviewing studies that had been published between January 2009 and May 2019. We searched three major databases for original works (26 studies) and for studies using brain imaging methods based on MRI (six studies). Adverse effects of air pollutants on selected cognitive or psychomotor functions were found in all of the studies. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide, for example, was linked to impaired working memory, general cognitive functions, and psychomotor functions; particulate matter 2.5 was linked to difficulties in working memory, short-term memory, attention, processing speed, and fine motor function; black carbon was linked to poor verbal intelligence, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory; airborne copper was linked to impaired attentiveness and fine motor skills; isophorone was linked to lower mathematical skills; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in fetal life were linked to lower intelligence scores. The studies using MRI showed that high concentrations of air pollutants were linked to changes in the brain's white matter or lower functional integration and segregation in children's brain networks. In view of the global increase in air pollution, there is a need for further research to elucidate the relationship between air pollution and cognitive and motor development in children. According to some studies, neuroinflammation, the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene, and gutathione-S-transferase gene polymorphism processes may play a role.", "It would be ideal for a non-hyperaemic index to predict fractional flow reserve (FFR) more accurately, given FFR's extensive validation in a multitude of clinical settings.\nThe aim of this study was to derive a novel non-hyperaemic algorithm based on deep learning and to validate it in an internal validation cohort against FFR.\nThe ARTIST study is a post hoc analysis of three previously published studies. In a derivation cohort (random 80% sample of the total cohort) a deep neural network was trained (deep learning) with paired examples of resting coronary pressure curves and their FFR values. The resulting algorithm was validated against unseen resting pressure curves from a random 20% sample of the total cohort. The primary endpoint was diagnostic accuracy of the deep learning-derived algorithms against binary FFR \u22640.8. To reduce the variance in the precision, we used a fivefold cross-validation procedure.\nA total of 1,666 patients with 1,718 coronary lesions and 2,928 coronary pressure tracings were included. The diagnostic accuracy of our convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) against binary FFR \u22640.80 was 79.6\u00b11.9% and 77.6\u00b12.3%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the accuracy of our neural networks to predict binary FFR and the most accurate non-hyperaemic pressure ratio (NHPR).\nCompared to standard derivation of resting pressure ratios, we did not find a significant improvement in FFR prediction when resting data are analysed using artificial intelligence approaches. Our findings strongly suggest that a larger class of hidden information within resting pressure traces is not the main cause of the known disagreement between resting indices and FFR. Therefore, if clinicians want to use FFR for clinical decision making, hyperaemia induction should remain the standard practice.", "We report the outputs of a satellite event in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, organized as part of the \"2 nd Global Grand Challenges of Engineering Summit\". The event considered challenges and potential solutions for improving low- and middle-income country (LMIC) healthcare systems, with particular reference to critical care.\u00a0 Participants from key regional and local stakeholders in healthcare and engineering discussed how new advances in technology, especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence, could be of potential benefit. This article summarizes the perspectives and conclusions of a group of key stakeholders from LMICs across South and South East Asia.", "The present study forms part of the project \"Cross-disciplinary education for sexual, body, and gender diversity\" (Code 419). The aim of this study was to analyze the role played by the psychoeducational variables involved in burnout (resilience, self-efficacy, self-esteem, emotional intelligence, empathy, and everyday stress) on attitudes toward sexual and gender diversity rights. Participants comprised 170 university students undertaking a degree in primary education. Instruments were administered to assess the constructs analyzed, ensuring informed consent, voluntary participation, anonymity, and data confidentiality. An ex post facto design was employed to determine whether attitudes toward sexual and gender diversity rights are influenced by the possible relationships and role of these variables. We found statistically significant associations between students' attitudes toward sexual and gender diversity at all three levels (sociocultural, relational, and personal) and the variable of burnout. Attitudes towards gender sexual orientation and gender identity rights influence burnout, and vice versa. As we ponder deeply about how these factors influence one another, we can shift our perspectives in a way that builds social harmony. It is important to learn how exactly these influences work, and this knowledge translates into making teaching strategies more effective to help raise awareness about guaranteeing rights for all. At the personal level of students' attitudes toward sexual and gender diversity/equality, we found positive correlations between this level and the total score for the variable of resilience and with its factor of personal competence. The data obtained will be of use for future psychoeducational assessment and intervention programs related to an education in sexual orientation and gender identity rights that are aimed at developing socio-emotional competencies and attention to diversity with the ultimate goal of improving social harmony by dismantling stereotypes and raising awareness of the importance of the variables of resilience, self-efficacy, self-esteem, emotional intelligence, empathy, and everyday stress which highlights how \"education is an instrument of social transformation\".", "OBJECTIVE. Outpatient appointment no-shows are a common problem. Artificial intelligence predictive analytics can potentially facilitate targeted interventions to improve efficiency. We describe a quality improvement project that uses machine learning techniques to predict and reduce outpatient MRI appointment no-shows. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Anonymized records from 32,957 outpatient MRI appointments between 2016 and 2018 were acquired for model training and validation along with a holdout test set of 1080 records from January 2019. The overall no-show rate was 17.4%. A predictive model developed with XGBoost, a decision tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework, was deployed after various machine learning algorithms were evaluated. The simple intervention measure of using telephone call reminders for patients with the top 25% highest risk of an appointment no-show as predicted by the model was implemented over 6 months. RESULTS. The ROC AUC for the predictive model was 0.746 with an optimized F1 score of 0.708; at this threshold, the precision and recall were 0.606 and 0.852, respectively. The AUC for the holdout test set was 0.738 with an optimized F1 score of 0.721; at this threshold, the precision and recall were 0.605 and 0.893, respectively. The no-show rate 6 months after deployment of the predictive model was 15.9% compared with 19.3% in the preceding 12-month preintervention period, corresponding to a 17.2% improvement from the baseline no-show rate (p < 0.0001). The no-show rates of contactable and noncontactable patients in the group at high risk of appointment no-shows as predicted by the model were 17.5% and 40.3%, respectively (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION. Machine learning predictive analytics perform moderately well in predicting complex problems involving human behavior using a modest amount of data with basic feature engineering, and they can be incorporated into routine workflow to improve health care delivery.", "The treatment of depression represents a major challenge for healthcare systems and choosing among the many available drugs without objective guidance criteria is an error-prone process. Recently, pharmacogenetic biomarkers entered in prescribing guidelines, giving clinicians the possibility to use this additional tool to guide prescription and improve therapeutic outcomes. This marked an important step towards precision psychiatry, which aim is to integrate biological and environmental information to personalise treatments. Only genetic variants in cytochrome enzymes are endorsed by prescribing guidelines, but in the future polygenic predictors of treatment outcomes may be translated into the clinic. The integration of genetics with other relevant information (e.g., concomitant diseases and treatments, drug plasma levels) could be managed in a standardised way through ad hoc software. The overcoming of the current obstacles (e.g., staff training, genotyping and informatics facilities) can lead to a broad implementation of precision psychiatry and represent a revolution for psychiatric care.Key pointsPrecision psychiatry aims to integrate biological and environmental information to personalise treatments and complement clinical judgementPharmacogenetic biomarkers in cytochrome genes were included in prescribing guidelines and represented an important step towards precision psychiatryTherapeutic drug monitoring is an important and cost-effective tool which should be integrated with genetic testing and clinical evaluation in order to optimise pharmacotherapyOther individual factors relevant to pharmacotherapy response (e.g., individual's symptom profile, concomitant diseases) can be integrated with genetic information through artificial intelligence to provide treatment recommendationsThe creation of pharmacogenetic services within healthcare systems is a challenging and multi-step process, education of health professionals, promotion by institutions and regulatory bodies, economic and ethical barriers are the main issues.", "We sought to measure the emotional intelligence (EI) of surgical faculty and the relationship between faculty EI and medical student (MS) evaluations of faculty.\nFaculty completed the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal. Aggregate, anonymous MS evaluations were collected from the Program Director's office. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used for analysis.\nThis study was first performed in a single surgical division at 1 center which informed an expanded study including the entire General Surgery Department at a single academic institution.\nA pilot study was conducted in 1 surgical division which was then expanded to all clinical faculty in the Department of Surgery. All clinical faculty in the Department of Surgery were eligible for enrollment.\nPilot study faculty EI scores were positively correlated with MS evaluations (r\u202f=\u202f0.92, p < 0.001). The follow-up study enrolled 41 surgeons with a median age of 48 (inter-quartile range 12). The sample was mostly white (70.7%). Mean EI for the group was 76 (standard deviation \u00b1 7.8). Total faculty EI scores were not significantly correlated with MS evaluations (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, p\u202f=\u202f0.06).\nMS evaluations of surgeon faculty were not related to EI in the larger sample. However, EI did correlate to MS evaluations in 2 surgical specialties. Further exploration into the utility of EI training in surgical departments should be conducted to determine the true value of such endeavors.", "Cognitive impairment in adult moyamoya disease (MMD) is thought to be the result of ischemic stroke; however, the presence and extent of cognitive decline in asymptomatic patients is unclear.\nAfter classification using T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a total of 19 MMD patients with a history of cerebral infarction, 21 asymptomatic MMD patients, and 20 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and years of education were prospectively included in this study. A detailed neuropsychological evaluation of two moyamoya subgroups and normal controls was conducted.\nAsymptomatic patients showed varying degrees of decline in intelligence (Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices, P\u2009=\u20090.001), spatial imagination (mental rotation, P\u2009=\u20090.014), working memory (verbal working memory-backward digit span, P\u2009=\u20090.011), and computational ability (simple subtraction, P\u2009=\u20090.014; complex subtraction, P\u2009<\u20090.001) compared with normal controls. MMD patients with cerebral infarction had more severe impairment in complex arithmetic (P\u2009=\u20090.027) and word short-term memory (P\u2009=\u20090.01) than those without symptoms.\nIn asymptomatic MMD patients, a variety of cognitive impairment precedes the onset of clinical symptoms such as cerebral infarction, which may be a long-term complication of conservative treatment.", "Background: Kimura disease may be easily misdiagnosed as malignant tumors such as lymph node metastases based on imaging and clinical symptoms. The aim of this article is to investigate whether the radiomic features and the model based on the features on venous-phase contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) images can distinguish Kimura disease from lymph node metastases in the head and neck. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 14 patients of head and neck Kimura disease (a total of 38 enlarged lymph nodes) and 39 patients with head and neck lymph node metastases (a total of 39 enlarged lymph nodes), confirmed by biopsy or surgery resection, was conducted. All patients accepted CECT within 10 days before biopsy or surgery resection. Radiomic features based on venous-phase CECT were generated automatically from Artificial-Intelligence Kit (AK) software. All lymph nodes were randomly divided into the training set (n = 54) and testing set (n = 23) in a ratio of 7:3. ANOVA + Mann-Whitney, Spearman correlation, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and Gradient Descent were introduced for the reduction of the highly redundant features. Binary logistic regression model was constructed based on the selected features. Receiver operating characteristic was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the features and the model. Finally, a nomogram was established for model application. Results: Seven features were screened out at the end. Significant difference was found between the two groups for all the features with area under the curves (AUCs) ranging from 0.759 to 0.915. The AUC of the model's identification performance was 0.970 in the training group and 0.977 in the testing group. The disease discrimination efficiency of the model was better than that of any single feature. Conclusions: The radiomic features and the model based on these features on venous-phase CECT images had very good performance for the discrimination between Kimura disease and lymph node metastases in the head and neck.", "Breast cancer screening has been shown to significantly reduce mortality in women. The increased utilization of screening examinations has led to growing demands for rapid and accurate diagnostic reporting. In modern breast imaging centers, full-field digital mammography (FFDM) has replaced traditional analog mammography, and this has opened new opportunities for developing computational frameworks to automate detection and diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI), and its subdomain of deep learning, is showing promising results and improvements on diagnostic accuracy, compared to previous computer-based methods, known as computer-aided detection and diagnosis.In this commentary, we review the current status of computational radiology, with a focus on deep neural networks used in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Recent studies are developing a new generation of computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems, as well as leveraging AI-driven tools to efficiently interpret digital mammograms, and breast tomosynthesis imaging. The use of AI in computational radiology necessitates transparency and rigorous testing. However, the overall impact of AI to radiology workflows will potentially yield more efficient and standardized processes as well as improve the level of care to patients with high diagnostic accuracy.", "Separate lines of epidemiological research suggest that individuals with high trait self-regulation (e.g. conscientious individuals) and individuals with higher cognitive ability (e.g. executive control/intelligence) each tend to enjoy superior health and well-being outcomes. However, it remains largely unexplored whether these personological and cognitive contributions to physical health are shared, independent, or interdependent. In the current study, we examined associations between trait self-regulation, cognitive control, self-reported physical health, and subjective well-being. A domain-general model revealed little shared variance between trait self-regulation and cognitive control but revealed significant unique relationships between each predictor and physical health. Results of a latent moderation analysis suggested that cognitive control moderated the contribution of self-regulation to health but not subjective well-being. This moderation effect was characterized by a strengthened relationship between trait self-regulation and health with decreases in cognitive control. Together, our results suggest that self-regulation and cognitive control may independently contribute to health outcomes in young adults and that self-regulation may be increasingly important for individuals lower in cognitive control.", "Background: High job demands and low job resources may cause job strain and eventually result in burnout. However, previous research has generally ignored the roles of time and self-regulation. Objectives: This theoretical article synthesizes the literature to propose a multilevel model that delineates how acute job strain translates into enduring and severe job burnout. Methods: We integrate self-regulation perspectives in job demands-resources (JD-R) theory to propose that short-term job strain and eventually enduring burnout is the result of consistently high job demands and low job resources - combined with failed self-regulation. Results: The model shows that when employees are confronted with increased job strain, they are more likely to use maladaptive self-regulation strategies, such as coping inflexibility and self-undermining. In addition, when job strain increases, employees are less likely to use adaptive self-regulation strategies, such as job stress recovery and job crafting. It follows that when the job becomes more stressful, stable resources become more important. Organizational resources such as human resource practices and healthy leadership may help employees to regulate their short-term fatigue and avoid enduring burnout. Furthermore, key personal resources like emotional intelligence and proactive personality may help employees to recognize and regulate their fatigue in an effective way. Conclusion: The proposed model of burnout expands JD-R theory and offers important practical implications for the prevention and reduction of burnout.", "Screening for breast cancer reduces breast cancer-related mortality and earlier detection facilitates less aggressive treatment. Unfortunately, current screening modalities are imperfect, suffering from limited sensitivity and high false-positive rates. Novel techniques in the field of breast imaging may soon play a role in breast cancer screening: digital breast tomosynthesis, contrast material-enhanced spectral mammography, US (automated three-dimensional breast US, transmission tomography, elastography, optoacoustic imaging), MRI (abbreviated and ultrafast, diffusion-weighted imaging), and molecular breast imaging. Artificial intelligence and radiomics have the potential to further improve screening strategies. Furthermore, nonimaging-based screening tests such as liquid biopsy and breathing tests may transform the screening landscape. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "The increasing digitalization of social life opens up new possibilities for modern health care. This article describes innovative application possibilities that could help to sustainably improve the treatment of severe injuries in the future with the help of methods such as big data, artificial intelligence, intelligence augmentation, and machine learning.

However, medical data is often sparse and hard to obtain due to legal restrictions and lack of medical personnel for the cumbersome and tedious process to manually label training data. These constraints make it difficult to develop systems for automatic analysis, like detecting disease or other lesions. In this respect, this article presents HyperKvasir, the largest image and video dataset of the gastrointestinal tract available today. The data is collected during real gastro- and colonoscopy examinations at B\u00e6rum Hospital in Norway and partly labeled by experienced gastrointestinal endoscopists. The dataset contains 110,079 images and 374 videos, and represents anatomical landmarks as well as pathological and normal findings. The total number of images and video frames together is around 1 million. Initial experiments demonstrate the potential benefits of artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnosis systems. The HyperKvasir dataset can play a valuable role in developing better algorithms and computer-assisted examination systems not only for gastro- and colonoscopy, but also for other fields in medicine.", "Discovering new treatments and personalizing existing ones is one of the major goals of modern clinical research. In the last decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has enabled the realization of advanced intelligent systems able to learn about clinical treatments and discover new medical knowledge from the huge amount of data collected. Reinforcement Learning (RL), which is a branch of Machine Learning (ML), has received significant attention in the medical community since it has the potentiality to support the development of personalized treatments in accordance with the more general precision medicine vision. This report presents a review of the role of RL in healthcare by investigating past work, and highlighting any limitations and possible future contributions.", "Cardiotocography is a common method of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) for fetal well-being. Data-driven analyses have shown potential for automated EFM assessment. For this preliminary study, we used a novel artificial intelligence method based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs), with deep learning for EFM evaluation and correct recognition, and its possible role in evaluation of nonreassuring fetal status.\nWe retrospectively collected 3239 EFM labor records from 292 deliveries and neonatal Apgar scores between December 2018 and July 2019 at a single medical center. We analyzed these data using an FCN model and compared the results with clinical practice.\nThe FCN model recognized EFM traces like physicians, with an average Cohen's kappa coefficient of agreement of 0.525 and average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.892 for six fetal heart rate (FHR) categories. The FCN model showed higher sensitivity for predicting fetal compromise (0.528 vs 0.132) but a higher false-positive rate (0.632 vs 0.012) compared with clinical practice.\nFCN is a modern technique that may be useful for EFM trace recognition based on its multiconvolutional layered analysis.

This study pioneered the use of full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) for rapid and automated on-site pathological diagnosis of GCA. Sixteen TABs (12 negative and 4 positive for GCA) were selected according to major histopathological criteria of GCA following hematoxylin-eosin-saffron-staining for subsequent acquisition with FF-OCT to compare structural modifications of the artery cell wall and thickness of each tunica. Gabor filtering of FF-OCT images was then used to compute TAB orientation maps and validate a potential automated analysis of TAB sections. FF-OCT allowed both qualitative and quantitative visualization of the main structures of the temporal artery wall, from the internal elastic lamina to the vasa vasorum and red blood cells, unveiling a significant correlation with conventional histology. FF-OCT imaging of GCA TABs revealed destruction of the media with distinct remodeling of the whole arterial wall into a denser reticular fibrous neo-intima, which is distinctive of GCA pathogenesis and accessible through automated Gabor filtering. Rapid on-site FF-OCT TAB acquisition makes it possible to identify some characteristic pathological lesions of GCA within a few minutes, paving the way for potential machine intelligence-based or even non-invasive diagnosis of GCA.", "The production of pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and food ingredients from biotechnological processes is a vast and rapidly growing industry. While advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have made it possible to produce thousands of new molecules from cells, few of these molecules have reached the market. The traditional methods of strain and bioprocess development that transform laboratory results to industrial processes are slow and use computers and networks only for data acquisition and storage. Digitalization, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) methods are transforming many fields - how can they be applied to bioprocessing to overcome current bottlenecks? What are the challenges, especially for regulatory issues, in the production of biopharmaceuticals? This chapter begins with a discussion of the current challenges for strain and bioprocess development and then considers how digitalization can be used to approach these tasks in completely new ways. Finally, regulatory considerations are addressed, with the goal of incorporating these issues from the outset as new digitalization methods are created.", "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic chronic inflammatory disease that affects synovial joints and has various extra-articular manifestations, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients with RA experience a higher risk of CVD, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Inflammation is a common phenomenon in RA and CVD. The pathophysiological association between these diseases is still not clear, and, thus, the risk assessment and detection of CVD in such patients is of clinical importance. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained prominence in advancing healthcare and, therefore, may further help to investigate the RA-CVD association. There are three aims of this review: (1) to summarize the three pathophysiological pathways that link RA to CVD; (2) to identify several traditional and carotid ultrasound image-based CVD risk calculators useful for RA patients, and (3) to understand the role of artificial intelligence in CVD risk assessment in RA patients. Our search strategy involves extensively searches in PubMed and Web of Science databases using search terms associated with CVD risk assessment in RA patients. A total of 120 peer-reviewed articles were screened for this review. We conclude that (a) two of the three pathways directly affect the atherosclerotic process, leading to heart injury, (b) carotid ultrasound image-based calculators have shown superior performance compared with conventional calculators, and (c) AI-based technologies in CVD risk assessment in RA patients are aggressively being adapted for routine practice of RA patients.", "A prerequisite of any psychological instrument used to compare individuals from different groups is measurement invariance (MI). It indicates that the test measures the same psychological constructs regardless of the particular grouping variable of the test-taker. Our purpose was to evaluate the MI across sex, age groups and educational levels in the recently adapted Estonian version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Third Edition (WAIS-III).\nWe analysed the Estonian standardization sample of WAIS-III (N\u2009=\u2009770) with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to establish the best baseline factor model for further analysis. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA) was applied to evaluate MI of the test and, granted this, mean differences across sex, age groups and educational levels.\nCFA supported the four-factor model. The test demonstrated partial MI across sexes; latent mean comparisons showed that men had a significantly higher mean score on the Perceptual Organization factor. Partial MI also held across age groups and, as expected, older groups had significantly lower means than younger age groups. The analyses across the educational levels failed to prove the MI as the metric invariance was not tenable.\nThe results of this study provide evidence that the structural model underlying the Estonian adaption of WAIS-III is partially invariant across sex and age groups, hence the test functions same manner across these groups. Estonian WAIS-III was not invariant across the educational levels, which may indicate that the measure has a different structure or meaning to different educational groups.", "The purpose of this study was to explore the use of fluorescein angiography (FA) images in a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the management of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).\nThe dataset involved a total of 835 FA images of 149 eyes (90 patients), where each eye was associated with a binary outcome (57 \"untreated\" eyes and 92 \"treated\"; 308 \"untreated\" images, 527 \"treated\"). The resolution of the images was 1600 and 1200 px in 20% of cases, whereas the remaining 80% had a resolution of 640 and 480 px. All the images were resized to 640 and 480 px before training and no other preprocessing was applied. A CNN with four convolutional layers was trained on 90% of the images (n = 752) randomly chosen. The accuracy of the prediction was assessed on the remaining 10% of images (n = 83). Keras version 2.2.0 for R with Tensorflow backend version 1.11.0 was used for the analysis.\nThe validation accuracy after 100 epochs was 0.88, whereas training accuracy was 0.97. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) presented an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91.\nOur study showed, we believe for the first time, the applicability of artificial intelligence (CNN) technology in the ROP management driven by FA. Further studies are needed to exploit different fields of applications of this technology.\nThis algorithm is the basis for a system that could be applied to both ROP as well as experimental oxygen induced retinopathy.", "Predicting Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) cell functions in stem cell implants using non-invasive bright field microscopy imaging is a critical task for clinical deployment of stem cell therapies. Such cell function predictions can be carried out using Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models. In this paper we used Traditional Machine Learning (TML) and Deep Learning (DL) based AI models for cell function prediction tasks. TML models depend on feature engineering and DL models perform feature engineering automatically but have higher modeling complexity. This work aims at exploring the tradeoffs between three approaches using TML and DL based models for RPE cell function prediction from microscopy images and at understanding the accuracy relationship between pixel-, cell feature-, and implant label-level accuracies of models. Among the three compared approaches to cell function prediction, the direct approach to cell function prediction from images is slightly more accurate in comparison to indirect approaches using intermediate segmentation and/or feature engineering steps. We also evaluated accuracy variations with respect to model selections (five TML models and two DL models) and model configurations (with and without transfer learning). Finally, we quantified the relationships between segmentation accuracy and the number of samples used for training a model, segmentation accuracy and cell feature error, and cell feature error and accuracy of implant labels. We concluded that for the RPE cell data set, there is a monotonic relationship between the number of training samples and image segmentation accuracy, and between segmentation accuracy and cell feature error, but there is no such a relationship between segmentation accuracy and accuracy of RPE implant labels.", "The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Korean version of the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (K-WLEIS).\nData were collected from 360 nursing students using a self reported questionnaire. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were used to test construct validity. Convergence validity was identified by correlation with communication competency. Item convergent and discriminant validity were also analyzed. Reliability was evaluated internal consistency and test-retest reliability.\nThe results of exploratory factor analysis showed that the eigen values ranged from 1.34 to 5.86 and 73.2% of the total explained variance. Confirmatory factor analysis showed adequate model fit indices (\u03c7\u00b2/df 1.89, RMSEA .07, GFI .89, CFI .95, and TLI .93) and standardized factor loadings (.48 to .87). The average extracted variances (.71 to .79) and composite reliability (.80 to .87) validated convergence and discriminant validity of the items. Test-retest reliability of intra-class correlation coefficient was .90 and the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was .88.\nThe K-WLEIS is an appropriate scale for measuring the emotional intelligence of Korean nursing students. Therefore, it is expected that the K-WLEIS will be used for nursing education programs to improve nursing students' emotional intelligence.", "Changes to the structure and function of neural networks are thought to underlie the evolutionary adaptation of animal behaviours. Among the many developmental phenomena that generate change programmed cell death (PCD) appears to play a key role. We show that cell death occurs continuously throughout insect neurogenesis and happens soon after neurons are born. Mimicking an evolutionary role for increasing cell numbers, we artificially block in the medial neuroblast lineage in Drosophila melanogaster, which results in the production of 'undead' neurons with complex arborisations and distinct neurotransmitter identities. Activation of these 'undead' neurons and recordings of neural activity in behaving animals demonstrate that they are functional. Focusing on two dipterans, which have lost flight during evolution, we reveal that reductions in populations of flight interneurons are likely caused by increased cell death during development. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary modulation of death-based patterning could generate novel network configurations.\nJust like a sculptor chips away at a block of granite to make a statue, the nervous system reaches its mature state by eliminating neurons during development through a process known as programmed cell death. In vertebrates, this mechanism often involves newly born neurons shrivelling away and dying if they fail to connect with others during development. Most studies in insects have focused on the death of neurons that occurs at metamorphosis, during the transition between larva to adult, when cells which are no longer needed in the new life stage are eliminated. Pop et al. harnessed a newly designed genetic probe to point out that, in fruit flies, programmed cell death of neurons at metamorphosis is not the main mechanism through which cells die. Rather, the majority of cell death takes place as soon as neurons are born throughout all larval stages, when most of the adult nervous system is built. To gain further insight into the role of this \u2018early\u2019 cell death, the neurons were stopped from dying, showing that these cells were able to reach maturity and function. Together, these results suggest that early cell death may be a mechanism fine-tuned by evolution to shape the many and varied nervous systems of insects. To explore this, Pop et al. looked for hints of early cell death in relatives of fruit flies that are unable to fly: the swift lousefly and the bee lousefly. This analysis showed that early cell death is likely to occur in these two insects, but it follows different patterns than in the fruit fly, potentially targeting the neurons that would have controlled flight in these flies\u2019 ancestors. Brains are the product of evolution: learning how neurons change their connections and adapt could help us understand how the brain works in health and disease. This knowledge may also be relevant to work on artificial intelligence, a discipline that often bases the building blocks and connections in artificial \u2018brains\u2019 on how neurons communicate with one another.", "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a burning topic and use of AI in our day-to-day life has increased exponentially. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes and perceptions of Turkish dental students towards AI and to provide information about their opinions to use of AI in dentistry.\nA 22-question survey was distributed through Google Forms to all dental students at 9 Turkish dental schools in March 2019. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the dental students' knowledge and attitudes toward AI and possible applications in dentistry. Respondents' anonymity was ensured.\nA total of 1103 students (650 female, 453 male; mean age was 21.36 \u00b1 1.93 years) responded to the questionnaire for a 21.69% response rate. Of these, about 48.40% had basic knowledge about AI technologies and 10.6% stated that they had no information sources about AI. 85.70% agreed that dentistry would be revolutionized by AI but 28.60% did not agree that AI could replace themselves in the near future. In addition, 74.60% and 79.80% of agreed on topics about AI to be included in undergraduate and postgraduate dental education, respectively.\nAlthough participants have insufficient knowledge of AI, they are willing to improve their knowledge in this field. Participants shared an optimistic views and thought that AI will have a positive impact on dental future practice. Follow-up surveys and multinational studies should be conducted to further explore these issues.", "Access to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) across developing countries ranges from being prohibitive to scarcely available. For example, eleven countries in Africa have no scanners. One critical limitation is the absence of skilled manpower required for MRI usage. Some of these challenges can be mitigated using autonomous MRI (AMRI) operation. In this work, we demonstrate AMRI to simplify MRI workflow by separating the required intelligence and user interaction from the acquisition hardware. AMRI consists of three components: user node, cloud and scanner. The user node voice interacts with the user and presents the image reconstructions at the end of the AMRI exam. The cloud generates pulse sequences and performs image reconstructions while the scanner acquires the raw data. An AMRI exam is a custom brain screen protocol comprising of one T1-, T2- and T2*-weighted exams. A neural network is trained to incorporate Intelligent Slice Planning (ISP) at the start of the AMRI exam. A Look Up Table was designed to perform intelligent protocolling by optimizing for contrast value while satisfying signal to noise ratio and acquisition time constraints. Data were acquired from four healthy volunteers for three experiments with different acquisition time constraints to demonstrate standard and self-administered AMRI. The source code is available online. AMRI achieved an average SNR of 22.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.89\u00a0dB across all experiments with similar contrast. Experiment #3 (33.66% shorter table time than experiment #1) yielded a SNR of 21.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.36\u00a0dB compared to 23.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.95\u00a0dB for experiment #1. AMRI can potentially enable multiple scenarios to facilitate rapid prototyping and research and streamline radiological workflow. We believe we have demonstrated the first Autonomous MRI of the brain.", "Current research in medical education is increasingly exploring the relevance of emotional intelligence (EI) in the successful performance of health-care people. As assessments of core domains are markers of actual performance of the student when he or she is not observed, this systematic review was aimed to answer the question \"what is the influence of EI on objective parameters of academic performance in undergraduate medical, dental, and nursing students aged 18-30 years?\"\nDatabases were systematically searched for empirical studies which measured EI of medical, nursing, or dental undergraduate students and compared it with academic performance during graduation years from January 1, 2000, to August 30, 2016. Quality appraisal and data abstraction was done by two independent authors.\nSix hundred and twenty-three articles were retrieved from systematic search. Of these, 25 articles were selected. Quality appraisal further led to exclusion of two studies which did not meet ethical criterion. Medical undergraduates were included in 12, dental in 4, and nursing in 7 studies. Four studies examined the relationship of EI with clinical skills, 8 with communication skills, and 18 with overall academic performance.\nThe findings of review show that EI has a greater role in academic success of clinical year medical and dental students. Although the review has addressed different rungs of the health-care profession separately, it preludes that better EI skills of health-care team will have a holistic impact on health-care improvement.", "The early identification of pathogenic mechanisms is essential to predict the incidence and progression of cardiomyopathies and to plan appropriate preventive interventions. Noninvasive cardiac imaging such as cardiac computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and nuclear imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and management of cardiomyopathies and provides useful prognostic information. Most molecular factors exert their functions by interacting with other cellular components, thus many diseases reflect perturbations of intracellular networks. Indeed, complex diseases and traits such as cardiomyopathies are caused by perturbations of biological networks. The network medicine approach, by integrating systems biology, aims to identify pathological interacting genes and proteins, revolutionizing the way to know cardiomyopathies and shifting the understanding of their pathogenic phenomena from a reductionist to a holistic approach. In addition, artificial intelligence tools, applied to morphological and functional imaging, could allow imaging scans to be automatically analyzed to extract new parameters and features for cardiomyopathy evaluation. The aim of this review is to discuss the tools of network medicine in cardiomyopathies that could reveal new candidate genes and artificial intelligence imaging-based features with the aim to translate into clinical practice as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers and shed new light on the clinical setting of cardiomyopathies. The integration and elaboration of clinical habits, molecular big data, and imaging into machine learning models could provide better disease phenotyping, outcome prediction, and novel drug targets, thus opening a new scenario for the implementation of precision medicine for cardiomyopathies.", "Advances in physical, technological and biological fields have made radiation oncology a discipline in continual evolution. New current research areas could be implemented in the clinic in the near future. In this review in the form of several interviews, various promising themes for our specialty are described such as the gut microbiota, tumor organoids (or avatar), artificial intelligence, connected therapies, nanotechnologies and plasma laser. The individual prediction of the best therapeutic index combined with the integration of new technologies will ideally allow highly personalized treatment of patients receiving radiation therapy.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to fundamentally alter the way medicine is practised. AI platforms excel in recognizing complex patterns in medical data and provide a quantitative, rather than purely qualitative, assessment of clinical conditions. Accordingly, AI could have particularly transformative applications in radiation oncology given the multifaceted and highly technical nature of this field of medicine with a heavy reliance on digital data processing and computer software. Indeed, AI has the potential to improve the accuracy, precision, efficiency and overall quality of radiation therapy for patients with cancer. In this Perspective, we first provide a general description of AI methods, followed by a high-level overview of the radiation therapy workflow with discussion of the implications that AI is likely to have on each step of this process. Finally, we describe the challenges associated with the clinical development and implementation of AI platforms in radiation oncology and provide our perspective on how these platforms might change the roles of radiotherapy medical professionals.", "Numerous advanced MR imaging and computed tomographic techniques have been developed and implemented in clinical practice over the past several years resulting in increased diagnostic accuracy and improved patient care. In this article, the authors highlight recent and emerging imaging techniques in functional and structural MR imaging, perfusion and vascular imaging, standardization of imaging practices, and selected applications of artificial intelligence in clinical practice.", "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which includes exposure and response prevention (ERP), is effective in improving symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, whether poor cognitive functions and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) traits affect the therapeutic response of patients with OCD to ERP-based CBT remains unclear. This study aimed to identify factors predictive of the therapeutic response of Japanese patients with OCD to ERP-based CBT.\nForty-two Japanese outpatients with OCD were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III), Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale, and Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) at pre- and post-treatment. We used multiple regression analyses to estimate the effect on therapeutic response change. The treatment response change was set as a dependent variable in multiple regression analyses.\nMultiple regression analyses showed that among independent variables, communication as an AQ sub-scale and Letter Number Sequencing as a WAIS-III sub-test predict the therapeutic response to ERP-based CBT .\nOur results suggest that diminished working memory (Letter Number Sequencing), poor communication skill (AQ sub-scale) may undermine responsiveness to ERP-based CBT among patients with OCD.\nUMIN, UMIN00024087 . Registered 20 September 2016 - Retrospectively registered (including retrospective data).", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has made great contributions to the healthcare industry. However, its effect on medical diagnosis has not been well explored. Here, we examined a trial comparing the thinking process between a computer and a master in diagnosis at a clinical conference in Japan, with a focus on general diagnosis. Consequently, not only was AI unable to exhibit its thinking process, it also failed to include the final diagnosis. The following issues were highlighted: (1) input information to AI could not be weighted in order of importance for diagnosis; (2) AI could not deal with comorbidities (see Hickam's dictum); (3) AI was unable to consider the timeline of the illness (depending on the tool); (4) AI was unable to consider patient context; (5) AI could not obtain input information by themselves. This comparison of the thinking process uncovered a future perspective on the use of diagnostic support tools.", "Technology has played an important role in responding to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic. The virus's blend of lethality and transmissibility have challenged officials and exposed critical limitations of the traditional public health apparatus. However, throughout this pandemic, technology has answered the call for a new form of public health that illustrates opportunities for enhanced agility, scale, and responsiveness. The authors share the Microsoft perspective and illustrate how technology has helped transform the public health landscape with new and refined capabilities - the efficacy and impact of which will be determined by history. Technologies like chatbot and virtualized patient care offer a mechanism to triage and distribute care at scale. Artificial intelligence and high-performance computing have accelerated research into understanding the virus and developing targeted therapeutics to treat infection and prevent transmission. New mobile contact tracing protocols that preserve patient privacy and civil liberties were developed in response to public concerns, creating new opportunities for privacy-sensitive technologies that aid efforts to prevent and control outbreaks. While much progress is still needed, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted technology's importance to public health security and pandemic preparedness. Future multi-stakeholder collaborations, including those with technology organizations, are needed to facilitate progress in overcoming the current pandemic, setting the stage for improved pandemic preparedness in the future. As lessons are assessed from the current pandemic, public officials should consider technology's role and continue to seek opportunities to supplement and improve on traditional approaches.", "This study aimed to assess the relationship between intelligence quotient and oral health conditions among intellectually disabled children.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted among 13-15 year old intellectually disabled children at National Institute of Mental Health, Hyderabad. The survey comprised of classification of intellectually disabled children based on their intelligent quotient (IQ) levels along with clinical oral examination using World health organization (WHO) oral health assessment form (2013). Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 21.0. p<0.05 was statistically significant.\nThe mean age of study participants was 13.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.04 years. Based on IQ levels, majority of the participants had moderate retardation (41.8%) and when oral health problems were compared, greater than 50% had gingivitis with mean DMFT scores of 2.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1. A significant higher mean DMFT scores were observed with profound retardation (4.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.17) (p=0.000) whereas greater preponderance for oral health problems was observed among moderately retarded subjects.\nOverall majority of the study participants were moderately retarded children and had gingivitis. The higher mean DMFT score was observed with profound retardation with statistical significance. However, Greater percentage of oral health problems were among moderately retarded children. Hence intellectually disabled children should be encouraged to take care about oral health themselves under the guidance of their care takers.", "Healthcare providers must acquire extensive knowledge and skills to help promote physical health, behavioral health, and wellness; prevent and treat illnesses and injuries; encourage and guide rehabilitation; counsel and assist with decisions relevant to health, life, and death. In addition, 21st Century healthcare providers must develop leadership knowledge and skills to optimize their interactions and effectiveness with healthcare teams, patients, and patients' significant others. Emotional intelligence is recognized as an essential component of leader education and development. It is important to optimally educate and develop healthcare providers with regard to components of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, social-awareness, and social regulation. Self-awareness focuses on understanding one's own behaviors, cognitions, motivations, and emotions. Self-regulation emphasizes self-control and adaptability to various situations and settings. Social awareness includes understanding others' behaviors, cognitions, motivations, and emotions. Social regulation draws upon the other components of emotional intelligence in order to optimize collaboration and cooperation and attainment of mutual goals with other people. The present paper presents four principles of Social Psychology that are relevant to developing emotionally intelligent healthcare leaders: Field Theory, Informal Social Communication, Social Comparison, and Cognitive Dissonance. Although these principles are well-established and have received extensive attention, analysis, and discussion in the academic social psychology literature, they are rarely mentioned in the emotional intelligence or leadership literatures. Therefore, each of these principles is briefly described in the present paper followed by an explanation of how each principle relates to the development of emotional intelligence in general and to emotionally intelligent healthcare leaders in particular.", "Over the last decade, major advancements in artificial intelligence technology have emerged and revolutionized the extent to which physicians are able to personalize treatment modalities and care for their patients. Artificial intelligence technology aimed at mimicking/simulating human mental processes, such as deep learning artificial neural networks (ANNs), are composed of a collection of individual units known as 'artificial neurons'. These 'neurons', when arranged and interconnected in complex architectural layers, are capable of analyzing the most complex patterns. The aim of this systematic review is to give a comprehensive summary of the contemporary applications of deep learning ANNs in urological medicine.\nFifty-five articles were included in this systematic review and each article was assigned an 'intermediate' score based on its overall quality. Of these 55 articles, nine studies were prospective, but no nonrandomized control trials were identified.\nIn urological medicine, the application of novel artificial intelligence technologies, particularly ANNs, have been considered to be a promising step in improving physicians' diagnostic capabilities, especially with regards to predicting the aggressiveness and recurrence of various disorders. For benign urological disorders, for example, the use of highly predictive and reliable algorithms could be helpful for the improving diagnoses of male infertility, urinary tract infections, and pediatric malformations. In addition, articles with anecdotal experiences shed light on the potential of artificial intelligence-assisted surgeries, such as with the aid of virtual reality or augmented reality.", "In the field of brain-computer interface (BCI), selecting efficient and robust features is very seductive for artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted clinical diagnosis. In this study, based on an embedded feature selection model, we construct a stacked deep structure for feature selection in a layer-by-layer manner. Its promising performance is guaranteed by the stacked generalized principle that random projections added into the original features can help us to continuously open the manifold structure existing in the original feature space in a stacked way. With such benefits, the original input feature space becomes more linearly separable. We use the epilepsy EEG data provided by the University of Bonn to evaluate our model. Based on the EEG data, we construct three classification tasks. On each task, we use different feature selection models to select features and then use two classifiers to perform classification based on the selected features. Our experimental results show that features selected by our new structure are more meaningful and helpful to the classifier hence generates better performance than benchmarking models.", "This review a highlights that to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools effectively for hypertension research, a new foundation to further understand the biology of hypertension needs to occur by leveraging genome and RNA sequencing technology and derived tools on a broad scale in hypertension.\nFor the last few years, progress in research and management of essential hypertension has been stagnating while at the same time, the sequencing of the human genome has been generating many new research tools and opportunities to investigate the biology of hypertension. Cancer research has applied modern tools derived from DNA and RNA sequencing on a large scale, enabling the improved understanding of cancer biology and leading to many clinical applications. Compared with cancer, studies in hypertension, using whole genome, exome, or RNA sequencing tools, total less than 2% of the number cancer studies. While true, sequencing the genome of cancer tissue has provided cancer research an advantage, DNA and RNA sequencing derived tools can also be used in hypertension to generate new understanding how complex protein network, in non-cancer tissue, adapts and learns to be effective when for example, somatic mutations or environmental inputs change the gene expression profiles at different network nodes. The amount of data and differences in clinical condition classification at the individual sample level might be of such magnitude to overwhelm and stretch comprehension. Here is the opportunity to use AI tools for the analysis of data streams derived from DNA and RNA sequencing tools combined with clinical data to generate new hypotheses leading to the discovery of mechanisms and potential target molecules from which drugs or treatments can be developed and tested. Basic and clinical research taking advantage of new gene sequencing-based tools, to uncover mechanisms how complex protein networks regulate blood pressure in health and disease, will be critical to lift hypertension research and management from its stagnation. The use of AI analytic tools will help leverage such insights. However, applying AI tools to vast amounts of data that certainly exist in hypertension, without taking advantage of new gene sequencing-based research tools, will generate questionable results and will miss many new potential molecular targets and possibly treatments. Without such approaches, the vision of precision medicine for hypertension will be hard to accomplish and most likely not occur in the near future.", "The study sought to understand the potential roles of a future artificial intelligence (AI) documentation assistant in primary care consultations and to identify implications for doctors, patients, healthcare system, and technology design from the perspective of general practitioners.\nCo-design workshops with general practitioners were conducted. The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these problems, and (3) discussing future roles for AI in primary care. The workshop activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed.\nTwo researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient care.\nAI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future primary care consultations. However, these technologies will still need to be supervised by a human until strong evidence for reliable autonomous performance is available. Therefore, different human-AI collaboration models will need to be designed and evaluated to ensure patient safety, quality of care, doctor safety, and doctor autonomy.", "Surgeries of pelvic bone tumors are very challenging due to the complexity of anatomical structures and the irregular bone shape. CT and MRI are used in clinic for tumor evaluation, each with its own advantages and shortcomings. Combining the data of both CT and MRI images would take advantage of the merits of both images and provide better model for preoperative evaluation. We utilized an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted CT/MRI image fusion technique and built a personalized 3-D model for preoperative tumor margin assessment. A young female patient with pelvic osteosarcoma was evaluated with our novel image fusion 3-D model in comparison with the 3-D model based solely on CT images. The fusion image model showed more detailed anatomical information and discovered multiple emboli within veins which were previously neglected. The discovery of emboli implied abysmal prognosis and discouraged any attempts for complex reconstruction after tumor resection. Based on the experience with this pelvic osteosarcoma, we believe that our image fusion model can be very informative with bone tumors. Though further validation with a large number of clinical cases is required, we propose that our model has the potential to benefit the clinic in the preoperative evaluation of bone tumors.", "CHD4 neurodevelopmental disorder (CHD4-NDD) is associated with developmental delay, speech delay, and usually mild-to-moderate intellectual disability. Variability between individuals with CHD4-NDD is significant, and a few have normal intelligence. Other manifestations can include brain anomalies, heart defects, and skeletal abnormalities; less common features are hypogonadism in males, hearing impairment, and ophthalmic abnormalities. Most affected individuals have mild nonspecific dysmorphic facial features with or without macrocephaly.\nThe diagnosis of CHD4-NDD is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CHD4 identified by molecular genetic testing.\nTreatment of manifestations: Developmental delay / intellectual disability, cervical spine instability and risk of spinal cord compression, refractive errors and strabismus, hearing impairment, congenital heart defects, behavioral issues, growth delay, hypogonadism in males, and renal anomalies are managed per standard care. Surveillance: Follow up of the common manifestations at each clinic visit. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Activities that involve rapid neck motion and/or possible trauma to the head and neck region (e.g., contact sports or thrill rides at amusement parks) because of the possible increased risk for cervical spine instability and spinal cord compression.\nCHD4-NDD is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. If the CHD4 pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either parent, the risk to sibs is low (~1%) but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the CHD4 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.", "Because of recent advances in computing technology and the availability of large datasets, deep learning has risen to the forefront of artificial intelligence, with performances that often equal, or sometimes even exceed, those of human subjects on a variety of tasks, especially those related to image classification and pattern recognition. As one of the medical fields that is highly dependent on ancillary imaging tests, ophthalmology has been in a prime position to witness the application of deep learning algorithms that can help analyze the vast amount of data coming from those tests. In particular, glaucoma stands as one of the conditions where application of deep learning algorithms could potentially lead to better use of the vast amount of information coming from structural and functional tests evaluating the optic nerve and macula. The purpose of this article is to critically review recent applications of deep learning models in glaucoma, discussing their advantages but also focusing on the challenges inherent to the development of such models for screening, diagnosis and detection of progression. After a brief general overview of deep learning and how it compares to traditional machine learning classifiers, we discuss issues related to the training and validation of deep learning models and how they specifically apply to glaucoma. We then discuss specific scenarios where deep learning has been proposed for use in glaucoma, such as screening with fundus photography, and diagnosis and detection of glaucoma progression with optical coherence tomography and standard automated perimetry.\nDeep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly improve diagnostic capabilities in glaucoma, but their application in clinical practice requires careful validation, with consideration of the target population, the reference standards used to build the models, and potential sources of bias.", "The rapid spread of novel coronavirus (namely Covid-19) worldwide has alarmed a pandemic since its outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. While the world still tries to wrap its head around as to how to contain the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, the pandemic has already claimed several thousand lives throughout the world. Yet, the diagnosis of virus spread in humans has proven complexity. A blend of computed tomography imaging, entire genome sequencing, and electron microscopy have been at first adapted to screen and distinguish SARS-CoV-2, the viral etiology of Covid-19. There are a less number of Covid-19 test kits accessible in hospitals because of the expanding cases every day. Accordingly, it is required to utensil a self-exposure framework as a fast substitute analysis to contain Covid-19 spreading among individuals considering the world at large. In the present work, we have elaborated a prudent methodology that helps identify Covid-19 infected people among the normal individuals by utilizing CT scan and chest x-ray images using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The strategy works with a dataset of Covid-19 and normal chest x-ray images. The image diagnosis tool utilizes decision tree classifier for finding novel corona virus infected person. The percentage accuracy of an image is analyzed in terms of precision, recall score and F1 score. The outcome depends on the information accessible in the store of Kaggle and Open-I according to their approved chest X-ray and CT scan images. Interestingly, the test methodology demonstrates that the intended algorithm is robust, accurate and precise. Our technique accomplishes the exactness focused on the AI innovation which provides faster results during both training and inference.", "The Reynolds Intellectual Screening Instrument (RIST) and its second edition (RIST-2) are brief intelligence screening instruments that potentially have value in older populations as their norms extend over age 90. This study examined performance on these two instruments in a sample of individuals presenting for evaluation in a memory disorder clinic.\nA sample of 1,145 subjects over the age of 50 was chosen from 1,761 consecutive referrals. Individuals who obtained a consensus diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; n\u00a0=\u00a0536), possible dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT; n\u00a0=\u00a0400), or those with subjective cognitive complaints (SCC; n\u00a0=\u00a0209) and who completed a neuropsychological battery that included either the RIST (n\u00a0=\u00a0747) or the RIST-2 (n\u00a0=\u00a0398) were included in the sample. No clinically significant demographic or neuropsychological performance differences were found for those taking either version of the RIST.\nUnlike the original version, RIST-2 Total and subtest scores were well below the mean for the DAT group and over 1 SD mean difference was seen for the DAT group when comparing the RIST and RIST-2 Totals. Diagnostic accuracy calculations suggested that the RIST-2 showed greater discrimination between the three groups although both versions achieved greater sensitivity than specificity.\nPerformance differences were evident when comparing the RIST and RIST-2, particularly for the DAT group. Although the RIST-2 evidenced greater diagnostic accuracy than its predecessor it should not be utilized in isolation for the clinical determination of DAT or MCI.", "If an artificial intelligence aims to maximize risk-adjusted return, then under mild conditions it is disproportionately likely to pick an unethical strategy unless the objective function allows sufficiently for this risk. Even if the proportion \u03b7 of available unethical strategies is small, the probability p U of picking an unethical strategy can become large; indeed, unless returns are fat-tailed p U tends to unity as the strategy space becomes large. We define an unethical odds ratio, \u03a5  (capital upsilon), that allows us to calculate p U from \u03b7, and we derive a simple formula for the limit of \u03a5  as the strategy space becomes large. We discuss the estimation of \u03a5  and p U in finite cases and how to deal with infinite strategy spaces. We show how the principle can be used to help detect unethical strategies and to estimate \u03b7. Finally we sketch some policy implications of this work.", "A norm-referenced score expresses the position of an individual test taker in the reference population, thereby enabling a proper interpretation of the test score. Such normed scores are derived from test scores obtained from a sample of the reference population. Typically, multiple reference populations exist for a test, namely when the norm-referenced scores depend on individual characteristic(s), as age (and sex). To derive normed scores, regression-based norming has gained large popularity. The advantages of this method over traditional norming are its flexible nature, yielding potentially more realistic norms, and its efficiency, requiring potentially smaller sample sizes to achieve the same precision. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to regression-based norming, using the generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). This approach has been useful in norm estimation of various psychological tests. We discuss the rationale of regression-based norming, theoretical properties of GAMLSS and their relationships to other regression-based norming models. Based on 6 steps, we describe how to: (a) design a normative study to gather proper normative sample data; (b) select a proper GAMLSS model for an empirical scale; (c) derive the desired normed scores for the scale from the fitted model, including those for a composite scale; and (d) visualize the results to achieve insight into the properties of the scale. Following these steps yields regression-based norms with GAMLSS for a psychological test, as we illustrate with normative data of the intelligence test IDS-2.

These specimens were derived from 2141 patients in 131 alliance hospitals of the Chinese Artificial Intelligence Alliance for Thyroid and Breast Ultrasound. The ultrasound features, including location, orientation, margin, halo, composition, echogenicity, echotexture, echogenic foci and posterior features were assessed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the association between ultrasound features and malignancy. The regression equation, the weighting, and the counting methods were used to determine the malignant risk of the thyroid nodules. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az values) were calculated.\nOf the 2141 thyroid nodules, 1572 were benign, 565 were malignant, and 4 were borderline. Vertical orientation, ill-defined, or irregular margin (including extrathyroidal extension), microcalcifications, solid, and markedly hypoechoic were positively associated with malignancy, while comet-tail artifacts were negatively associated with malignancy. The logistic regression equation yielded the highest Az value of 0.913, which was significantly higher than that obtained using the weighting method (0.893) and the counting method (0.890); however, no significant difference was found between the latter two. The C-TIRADS, based on the counting method, was designed following the principle of balancing the diagnostic performance and sensitivity of the risk stratification with the ease of use.\nA relatively simple C-TIRADS was established using the counting value of positive and negative ultrasound features.", "Antenatal Doppler measurements of the fetal umbilical and cerebral circulations can predict perinatal complications; however, it is unclear if subtle variations in antenatal Doppler measurements are associated with long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. In this study, we examined whether antenatal Doppler measurements of the fetal-placental circulation are associated with cognitive and motor abilities and brain morphology in childhood.\nTo evaluate differences in long-term sequelae across the continuum of the umbilical and cerebral artery circulations in the general population, we utilized a population-based longitudinal cohort study approach. In women from the Generation R study, we measured second- and third-trimester umbilical artery pulsatility index (UA-PI). Children underwent non-verbal intelligence testing at 4-8\u2009years of age, and at 8-12\u2009years they underwent finger-tapping tests to measure fine motor skills, balance beam tests to measure gross motor skills and brain magnetic resonance imaging. We assessed the relationships between prenatal UA-PI and neurodevelopmental outcome using linear regression. We adjusted for child age and sex, maternal age, education, parity and smoking status.\nThe study sample included 2803 pregnancies. Higher third-trimester UA-PI was associated with poorer fine motor performance (0.41 (95%\u2009CI, 0.11-0.70) fewer taps on the finger-tapping test per 1\u00a0SD higher UA-PI) and gross motor performance (0.64 (95%\u2009CI, 0.20-1.08) fewer steps on the balance beam test per 1\u00a0SD higher UA-PI). One SD higher third-trimester UA-PI was also associated with 0.65 (95%\u2009CI, 0.04-1.25) points lower intelligence quotient; however, unlike the associations with motor abilities, this finding did not persist after correction for multiple testing. Higher second-trimester UA-PI was associated with smaller brain volume (6.1 (95%\u2009CI, 1.0-11.3) cm3 reduction per 1\u00a0SD higher UA-PI), but the association did not persist after correction for multiple testing.\nHigher placental vascular resistance may have mild adverse effects on neurodevelopmental outcome at school age. While these effects are subtle at population level, we encourage future research into the role of early circulation in brain development. This information could be used to develop targeted interventions. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

This study focused on the evaluation of reading performance and the frequency of dyslexia in adult DM1 patients.\nWe performed a prospective cohort study including genetically confirmed adult DM1 patients registered in the DM registry of Germany or the internal database of the Friedrich-Baur-Institute, Munich, Germany. For the assessment of the patients' reading and spelling performance, we used the standardized and validated test 'Salzburger Lese- und Rechtschreibtest' (SLRT II). The 'CFT-20 R Grundintelligenztest Skala 2' in revised (\"R\") version (CFT 20-R), determining the intelligence level, was appropriate to differentiate between dyslexia and general mental retardation. The diagnosis of dyslexia, the combined reading and spelling disorder, was based on the guidelines for diagnosis and therapy of children and adolescents with dyslexia 2015 (S3-guideline) providing (1) the criterion of the divergence from age level and (2) the criterion of IQ-divergence.\nFifty-seven DM1 patients participated in our study. Evaluating the reading performance, 16 patients fulfilled the divergence criteria of the age level and 2 patients the IQ-divergence criteria. In total, the diagnosis of a reading disorder was given in 18 DM1 patients (31.6 %). In 11 out of these 18 patients with a reading disorder, a relevant impairment of spelling performance was observed with at least three spelling errors. As there are no normative values for adults in spelling performance, we assume a combined reading disorder and dyslexia, in those 11 DM1 patients (19.3 %). Regarding the separate analyses of the test procedures, in the SLRT II the performance was below average in 40.4 % of all patients for 'word reading' and in 61.4 % of all patients for 'pseudoword reading'. There was a significant positive correlation between the CTG expansion size and a reading disorder (p=0.027). The average IQ of 17 examined DM1 patients was in the lower normal range (86.1 \u00b1 19.1). 54.5 % of patients with reading disorder had a normal IQ.\nThe calculated prevalence of dyslexia in the DM1 study cohort was 19.3 % and thus considerably increased compared to the normal German population. As dyslexia is not equivalent to a general cognitive impairment, it is important not to miss dyslexic features in cognitive inconspicuous DM1 patients. Case-by-case one should consider a differential diagnostic approach, as individualized therapies can be offered to support dyslexic patients in their performance.", "Technology advancements have a rapid effect on every field of life, be it medical field or any other field. Artificial intelligence has shown the promising results in health care through its decision making by analysing the data. COVID-19 has affected more than 100 countries in a matter of no time. People all over the world are vulnerable to its consequences in future. It is imperative to develop a control system that will detect the coronavirus. One of the solution to control the current havoc can be the diagnosis of disease with the help of various AI tools. In this paper, we classified textual clinical reports into four classes by using classical and ensemble machine learning algorithms. Feature engineering was performed using techniques like Term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF), Bag of words (BOW) and report length. These features were supplied to traditional and ensemble machine learning classifiers. Logistic regression and Multinomial Na\u00efve Bayes showed better results than other ML algorithms by having 96.2% testing accuracy. In future recurrent neural network can be used for better accuracy.", "To test the feasibility of using deep learning for optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) detection of diabetic retinopathy.\nA deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, VGG16, was employed for this study. A transfer learning process was implemented to retrain the CNN for robust OCTA classification. One dataset, consisting of images of 32 healthy eyes, 75 eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 24 eyes with diabetes but no DR (NoDR), was used for training and cross-validation. A second dataset consisting of 20 NoDR and 26 DR eyes was used for external validation. To demonstrate the feasibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) screening of DR in clinical environments, the CNN was incorporated into a graphical user interface (GUI) platform.\nWith the last nine layers retrained, the CNN architecture achieved the best performance for automated OCTA classification. The cross-validation accuracy of the retrained classifier for differentiating among healthy, NoDR, and DR eyes was 87.27%, with 83.76% sensitivity and 90.82% specificity. The AUC metrics for binary classification of healthy, NoDR, and DR eyes were 0.97, 0.98, and 0.97, respectively. The GUI platform enabled easy validation of the method for AI screening of DR in a clinical environment.\nWith a transfer learning process for retraining, a CNN can be used for robust OCTA classification of healthy, NoDR, and DR eyes. The AI-based OCTA classification platform may provide a practical solution to reducing the burden of experienced ophthalmologists with regard to mass screening of DR patients.\nDeep-learning-based OCTA classification can alleviate the need for manual graders and improve DR screening efficiency.", "Air pollution can increase the risk of respiratory diseases, enhancing the susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections. Some studies suggest that small air particles facilitate the spread of viruses and also of the new coronavirus, besides the direct person-to-person contagion. However, the effects of the exposure to particulate matter and other contaminants on SARS-CoV-2 has been poorly explored. Here we examined the possible reasons why the new coronavirus differently impacted on Italian regional and provincial populations. With the help of artificial intelligence, we studied the importance of air pollution for mortality and positivity rates of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy. We discovered that among several environmental, health, and socio-economic factors, air pollution and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as its main component, resulted as the most important predictors of SARS-CoV-2 effects. We also found that the emissions from industries, farms, and road traffic - in order of importance - might be responsible for more than 70% of the deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 nationwide. Given the major contribution played by air pollution (much more important than other health and socio-economic factors, as we discovered), we projected that, with an increase of 5-10% in air pollution, similar future pathogens may inflate the epidemic toll of Italy by 21-32% additional cases, whose 19-28% more positives and 4-14% more deaths. Our findings, demonstrating that fine-particulate (PM2.5) pollutant level is the most important factor to predict SARS-CoV-2 effects that would worsen even with a slight decrease of air quality, highlight that the imperative of productivity before health and environmental protection is, indeed, a short-term/small-minded resolution.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented health and economic worldwide crisis. Innovative solutions are imperative given limited resources and immediate need for medical supplies, healthcare support and treatments.\nThe purpose of this review is to summarize emerging technologies being implemented in the study, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19.\nKey focus areas include the applications of artificial intelligence, the use of Big Data and Internet of Things, the importance of mathematical modeling for predictions, utilization of technology for community screening, the use of nanotechnology for treatment and vaccine development, the utility of telemedicine, the implementation of 3D-printing to manage new demands and the potential of robotics.\nThe review concludes by highlighting the need for collaboration in the scientific community with open sharing of knowledge, tools, and expertise.", "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by behavioral alterations and currently affect about 1% of children. Significant genetic factors and mechanisms underline the causation of ASD. Indeed, many affected individuals are diagnosed with chromosomal abnormalities, submicroscopic deletions or duplications, single-gene disorders or variants. However, a range of metabolic abnormalities has been highlighted in many patients, by identifying biofluid metabolome and proteome profiles potentially usable as ASD biomarkers. Indeed, next-generation sequencing and other omics platforms, including proteomics and metabolomics, have uncovered early age disease biomarkers which may lead to novel diagnostic tools and treatment targets that may vary from patient to patient depending on the specific genomic and other omics findings. The progressive identification of new proteins and metabolites acting as biomarker candidates, combined with patient genetic and clinical data and environmental factors, including microbiota, would bring us towards advanced clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) assisted by machine learning models for advanced ASD-personalized medicine. Herein, we will discuss novel computational solutions to evaluate new proteome and metabolome ASD biomarker candidates, in terms of their recurrence in the reviewed literature and laboratory medicine feasibility. Moreover, the way to exploit CDSS, performed by artificial intelligence, is presented as an effective tool to integrate omics data to electronic health/medical records (EHR/EMR), hopefully acting as added value in the near future for the clinical management of ASD.", "Like previous educational technologies, artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) threatens to disrupt the status quo, with proponents highlighting the potential for efficiency and democratization, and skeptics warning of industrialization and alienation. However, unlike frequently discussed applications of AI in autonomous vehicles, military and cybersecurity concerns, and healthcare, AI's impacts on education policy and practice have not yet captured the public's attention. This paper, therefore, evaluates the status of AIEd, with special attention to intelligent tutoring systems and anthropomorphized artificial educational agents. I discuss AIEd's purported capacities, including the abilities to simulate teachers, provide robust student differentiation, and even foster socio-emotional engagement. Next, to situate developmental pathways for AIEd going forward, I contrast sociotechnical possibilities and risks through two idealized futures. Finally, I consider a recent proposal to use peer review as a gatekeeping strategy to prevent harmful research. This proposal serves as a jumping off point for recommendations to AIEd stakeholders towards improving their engagement with socially responsible research and implementation of AI in educational systems.", "There is a great need for innovative new medicines to treat unmet medical needs. The discovery and development of innovative new medicines is extremely difficult, costly, and inefficient. In the last decade, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) was reintroduced as a strategy to provide first-in-class medicines. PDD uses empirical, target-agnostic lead generation to identify pharmacologically active molecules and novel therapeutics which work through unprecedented drug mechanisms. The economic and scientific value of PDD is exemplified through game-changing medicines for hepatitis C virus, spinal muscular atrophy, and cystic fibrosis. In this short review, recent advances are noted for the implementation and de-risking of PDD (for compound library selection, biomarker development, mechanism identification, and safety studies) and the potential for artificial intelligence. A significant barrier in the decision to implement PDD is balancing the potential impact of a novel mechanism of drug action with an under-defined scientific path forward, with the desire to provide infrastructure and metrics to optimize return on investment, which a known mechanism provides. A means to address this knowledge gap in the future is to empower precompetitive research utilizing the empirical concepts of PDD to identify new mechanisms and pharmacologically active compounds.", "Working memory (WM), the representation of information held accessible for manipulation over time, is an essential component of all higher cognitive abilities. It allows for complex behaviors that go beyond simple stimulus-response associations and inflexible behavioral patterns. WM capacity determines how many different pieces of information (items) can be used for these cognitive processes, and in humans, it correlates with fluid intelligence. As such, WM might be a useful tool for comparison of cognition across species. WM can be tested using comparatively simple behavioral protocols, based on operant conditioning, in a multitude of different species. Species-specific contextual variables that influence an animal's performance on a non-cognitive level are controlled by adapting the WM paradigm. The neuronal mechanisms by which WM emerges in the brain, as sustained neuronal activity, are comparable between the different species studied (mammals and birds), as are the areas of the brain in which WM activity can be measured. Thus WM is comparable between vastly different species within their respective niches, accounting for specific contextual variables and unique adaptations. By approaching the question of \"general cognitive abilities\" or \"intelligence\" within the animal kingdom from the perspective of WM, the complexity of the core question at hand is reduced to a fundamental memory system required to allow for complex cognitive abilities. This article argues that measuring WM can be a suitable addition to the toolkit of comparative cognition. By measuring WM on a behavioral level and going beyond behavior to the underlying physiological processes, qualitative and quantitative differences in cognition between different animal species can be identified, free of contextual restraints.", "The study examined trait emotional intelligence as a predictor for emotional reactions experienced during the first full week of the lockdown in Poland (from 16th to 22nd March). One hundred and thirty persons (101 women and 25 men; 4 did not report their gender)participated in the baseline measurement of trait emotional intelligence, positive and negative affect, and affect intensity and in a one-week daily diary. Trait emotional intelligence correlated positively with baseline positive affect and positive intensity, while negatively with baseline negative affect and negative intensity. Trait emotional intelligence marginally significantly predicted a lower frequency of anger, disgust, and sadness during the first week of the pandemic. Trait emotional intelligence predicted a lower intensity of fear, anxiety and sadness. The study showed a complex dynamics of emotional experiences during the first week of the COVID-19 pandemic. Positive states of relaxation and happiness were experienced more frequently and more intensely compared to the negatively-valenced emotions. The protective role of trait emotional intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak was mainly associated with experiencing negative emotions (fear, anxiety, and sadness) less intensely, but not less frequently.", "Recent studies have demonstrated the successful application of artificial intelligence (AI) for automated retinal disease diagnostics but have not addressed a fundamental challenge for deep learning systems: the current need for large, criterion standard-annotated retinal data sets for training. Low-shot learning algorithms, aiming to learn from a relatively low number of training data, may be beneficial for clinical situations involving rare retinal diseases or when addressing potential bias resulting from data that may not adequately represent certain groups for training, such as individuals older than 85 years.\nTo evaluate whether low-shot deep learning methods are beneficial when using small training data sets for automated retinal diagnostics.\nThis cross-sectional study, conducted from July 1, 2019, to June 21, 2020, compared different diabetic retinopathy classification algorithms, traditional and low-shot, for 2-class designations (diabetic retinopathy warranting referral vs not warranting referral). The public domain EyePACS data set was used, which originally included 88\u202f692 fundi from 44\u202f346 individuals. Statistical analysis was performed from February 1 to June 21, 2020.\nThe performance (95% CIs) of the various AI algorithms was measured via receiver operating curves and their area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, accuracy, and F1 score, evaluated for different training data sizes, ranging from 5120 to 10 samples per class.\nDeep learning algorithms, when trained with sufficiently large data sets (5120 samples per class), yielded comparable performance, with an AUC of 0.8330 (95% CI, 0.8140-0.8520) for a traditional approach (eg, fined-tuned ResNet), compared with low-shot methods (AUC, 0.8348 [95% CI, 0.8159-0.8537]) (using self-supervised Deep InfoMax [our method denoted as DIM]). However, when far fewer training images were available (n\u2009=\u2009160), the traditional deep learning approach had an AUC decreasing to 0.6585 (95% CI, 0.6332-0.6838) and was outperformed by a low-shot method using self-supervision with an AUC of 0.7467 (95% CI, 0.7239-0.7695). At very low shots (n\u2009=\u200910), the traditional approach had performance close to chance, with an AUC of 0.5178 (95% CI, 0.4909-0.5447) compared with the best low-shot method (AUC, 0.5778 [95% CI, 0.5512-0.6044]).\nThese findings suggest the potential benefits of using low-shot methods for AI retinal diagnostics when a limited number of annotated training retinal images are available (eg, with rare ophthalmic diseases or when addressing potential AI bias).", "The question of whether some non-human animal species are more intelligent than others is a reoccurring theme in comparative psychology. To convincingly address this question, exact comparability of behavioral methodology and data across species is required. The current article explores one of the rare cases in which three vertebrate species (humans, macaques, and crows) experienced identical experimental conditions during the investigation of a core cognitive capability - the abstract categorization of absolute numerical quantity. We found that not every vertebrate species studied in numerical cognition were able to flexibly discriminate absolute numerosity, which suggests qualitative differences in numerical intelligence are present between vertebrates. Additionally, systematic differences in numerosity judgment accuracy exist among those species that could master abstract and flexible judgments of absolute numerosity, thus arguing for quantitative differences between vertebrates. These results demonstrate that Macphail's Null Hypotheses - which suggests that all non-human vertebrates are qualitatively and quantitatively of equal intelligence - is untenable.", "Medical research shows that eye movement disorders are related to many kinds of neurological diseases. Eye movement characteristics can be used as biomarkers of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia, and other diseases. However, due to the unknown medical mechanism of some diseases, it is difficult to establish an intuitive correspondence between eye movement characteristics and diseases. In this paper, we propose a disease classification method based on decision tree and random forest (RF). First, a variety of experimental schemes are designed to obtain eye movement images, and information such as pupil position and area is extracted as original features. Second, with the original features as training samples, the long short-term memory (LSTM) network is used to build classifiers, and the classification results of the samples are regarded as the evolutionary features. After that, multiple decision trees are built according to the C4.5 rules based on the evolutionary features. Finally, a RF is constructed with these decision trees, and the results of disease classification are determined by voting. Experiments show that the RF method has good robustness and its classification accuracy is significantly better than the performance of previous classifiers. This study shows that the application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the pathological analysis of eye movement has obvious advantages and good prospects.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for automated classification of skin diseases are available to the consumer market. Studies of their diagnostic accuracy are rare. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of an open-access AI application (Skin Image Search\u2122) for recognition of skin diseases. Clinical images including tumours, infective and inflammatory skin diseases were collected at the Department of Dermatology at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital and uploaded for classification by the online application. The AI algorithm classified the images giving 5 differential diagnoses, which were then compared to the diagnoses made clinically by the dermatologists and/or histologically. We included 521 images portraying 26 diagnoses. The diagnostic accuracy was 56.4% for the top 5 suggested diagnoses and 22.8% when only considering the most probable diagnosis. The level of diagnostic accuracy varied considerably for diagnostic groups. The online application demonstrated low diagnostic accuracy compared to a dermatologist evaluation and needs further development.", "This study aimed to develop an automated system with artificial intelligence algorithms to comprehensively identify pathologic retinal cases and make urgent referrals.\nTo build and test the intelligent system, this study obtained 28,664 optical coherence tomography (OCT) images from 2254 patients in the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University (EENT Hospital) and Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital (TENTH Hospital). We applied a deep learning model with an adapted feature pyramid network to detect 15 categories of retinal pathologies from OCT images as common signs of various retinal diseases. Subsequently, the pathologies detected in the OCT images and thickness features extracted from retinal thickness measurements were combined for urgent referral using the random forest tool.\nThe retinal pathologies detection model had a sensitivity of 96.39% and specificity of 98.91% from the EENT Hospital test dataset, whereas those from the TENTH Hospital test dataset were 94.89% and 98.76%, respectively. The urgent referral model achieved accuracies of 98.12% and 98.01% from the EENT Hospital and TENTH Hospital test datasets, respectively.\nAn intelligent system capable of automatically identifying pathologic retinal cases and offering urgent referrals was developed and demonstrated reliable performance with high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.\nThis intelligent system has great value and practicability in communities where exist increasing cases of retinal disease and a lack of ophthalmologists.", "Information, archives, and intelligent artificial systems are part of everyday life in modern medicine. They already support medical staff by mapping their workflows with shared availability of cases' referral information, as needed for example, by the pathologist, and this support will be increased in the future even more. In radiology, established standards define information models, data transmission mechanisms, and workflows. Other disciplines, such as pathology, cardiology, and radiation therapy, now define further demands in addition to these established standards. Pathology may have the highest technical demands on the systems, with very complex workflows, and the digitization of slides generating enormous amounts of data up to Gigabytes per biopsy. This requires enormous amounts of data to be generated per biopsy, up to the gigabyte range. Digital pathology allows a change from classical histopathological diagnosis with microscopes and glass slides to virtual microscopy on the computer, with multiple tools using artificial intelligence and machine learning to support pathologists in their future work.", "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is sweeping the globe and has resulted in infections in millions of people. Patients with COVID-19 face a high fatality risk once symptoms worsen; therefore, early identification of severely ill patients can enable early intervention, prevent disease progression, and help reduce mortality. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence-assisted tool using computed tomography (CT) imaging to predict disease severity and further estimate the risk of developing severe disease in patients suffering from COVID-19.\nInitial CT images of 408 confirmed COVID-19 patients were retrospectively collected between January 1, 2020 and March 18, 2020 from hospitals in Honghu and Nanchang. The data of 303 patients in the People's Hospital of Honghu were assigned as the training data, and those of 105 patients in The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were assigned as the test dataset. A deep learning based-model using multiple instance learning and residual convolutional neural network (ResNet34) was developed and validated. The discrimination ability and prediction accuracy of the model were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve and confusion matrix, respectively.\nThe deep learning-based model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.987 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.968-1.00) and an accuracy of 97.4% in the training set, whereas it had an AUC of 0.892 (0.828-0.955) and an accuracy of 81.9% in the test set. In the subgroup analysis of patients who had non-severe COVID-19 on admission, the model achieved AUCs of 0.955 (0.884-1.00) and 0.923 (0.864-0.983) and accuracies of 97.0 and 81.6% in the Honghu and Nanchang subgroups, respectively.\nOur deep learning-based model can accurately predict disease severity as well as disease progression in COVID-19 patients using CT imaging, offering promise for guiding clinical treatment.", "During the recent global urgency, scientists, clinicians, and healthcare experts around the globe keep on searching for a new technology to support in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. The evidence of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) application on the previous epidemic encourage researchers by giving a new angle to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak. This paper aims to comprehensively review the role of AI and ML as one significant method in the arena of screening, predicting, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug development for SARS-CoV-2 and its related epidemic.\nA selective assessment of information on the research article was executed on the databases related to the application of ML and AI technology on Covid-19. Rapid and critical analysis of the three crucial parameters, i.e., abstract, methodology, and the conclusion was done to relate to the model's possibilities for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.\nThis paper addresses on recent studies that apply ML and AI technology towards augmenting the researchers on multiple angles.

However, most of the models are not deployed enough to show their real-world operation, but they are still up to the mark to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.", "Multimodal imaging is able to image the retina in unprecedented detail, and the joint analysis (integration) of these data not only enables the securing of diagnoses, but also a more precise definition; however, humans encounter temporal and cognitive limitations in the analysis of this amount of information, so that the potential of a\u00a0joint examination of the findings is largely unused to date. Automatic image processing and methods, which are summarized under the collective term of artificial intelligence (AI), are able to overcome the bottleneck in the evaluation and to exploit the full potential of the available data. A\u00a0basic understanding of AI methods and the ability to implement them will become increasingly more important for ophthalmologists in the future. In this article we give an insight into the functionality of AI methods and the current state of research in the field of automatic image analysis.\nMultimodale Bildgebung kann die Netzhaut in bisher unerreichtem Detail abbilden, und die gemeinsame Analyse (Integration) dieser Daten erm\u00f6glicht nicht nur die Sicherung von Diagnosen, sondern auch deren Pr\u00e4zisierung.

We examined (N\u00a0=\u00a0476) how (manipulated) individual differences in intelligence affect likability ratings of men and women. We found that (1) ratings were generally more favorable than unfavorable, (2) the difference between favorable and unfavorable ratings of the female target differed more than those same evaluations of the male target, (3) the favorable evaluation tendency was present across relative intelligence but weakest when the target was smarter than the participant, (4) the smarter target was rated more unfavorably, and (5) the equally smart target was rated more favorably than the less intelligent target. Results suggest that people are somewhat conflicted in their evaluations of those smarter than they are whereas similarly and less intelligent people presented less of an apparent conflict in evaluations.", "Affective computing is one of the key technologies to achieve advanced brain-machine interfacing. It is increasingly concerning research orientation in the field of artificial intelligence. Emotion recognition is closely related to affective computing. Although emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) has attracted more and more attention at home and abroad, subject-independent emotion recognition still faces enormous challenges. We proposed a subject-independent emotion recognition algorithm based on dynamic empirical convolutional neural network (DECNN) in view of the challenges. Combining the advantages of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and differential entropy (DE), we proposed a dynamic differential entropy (DDE) algorithm to extract the features of EEG signals. After that, the extracted DDE features were classified by convolutional neural networks (CNN). Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified on SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED). In addition, we discuss the brain area closely related to emotion and design the best profile of electrode placements to reduce the calculation and complexity. Experimental results show that the accuracy of this algorithm is 3.53 percent higher than that of the state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods. What's more, we studied the key electrodes for EEG emotion recognition, which is of guiding significance for the development of wearable EEG devices.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly present in radiology and health care. This expansion is driven by the principal AI strengths: automation, accuracy, and objectivity. However, as radiology AI matures to become fully integrated into the daily radiology routine, it needs to go beyond replicating static models, toward discovering new knowledge from the data and environments around it. Continuous learning AI presents the next substantial step in this direction and brings a new set of opportunities and challenges. Herein, the authors discuss the main concepts and requirements for implementing continuous AI in radiology and illustrate them with examples from emerging applications.", "Artificial intelligence and multiobjective optimization represent promising solutions to bridge chemical and biological landscapes by addressing the automated de novo design of compounds as a result of a humanlike creative process. In the present study, we conceived a novel pair-based multiobjective approach implemented in an adapted SMILES generative algorithm based on recurrent neural networks for the automated de novo design of new molecules whose overall features are optimized by finding the best trade-offs among relevant physicochemical properties (MW, logP, HBA, HBD) and additional similarity-based constraints biasing specific biological targets. In this respect, we carried out the de novo design of chemical libraries targeting neuraminidase, acetylcholinesterase, and the main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Several quality metrics were employed to assess drug-likeness, chemical feasibility, diversity content, and validity. Molecular docking was finally carried out to better evaluate the scoring and posing of the de novo generated molecules with respect to X-ray cognate ligands of the corresponding molecular counterparts. Our results indicate that artificial intelligence and multiobjective optimization allow us to capture the latent links joining chemical and biological aspects, thus providing easy-to-use options for customizable design strategies, which are especially effective for both lead generation and lead optimization. The algorithm is freely downloadable at https://github.com/alberdom88/moo-denovo and all of the data are available as Supporting Information.", "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency has amplified both the potential value and the challenges with healthcare providers deploying telehealth solutions. As people across the country find ways to stay at home, telehealth preserves an opportunity to obtain necessary healthcare services. Further, telehealth can help individuals avoid COVID-19 infection, free up hospital beds and other resources for those patients most in need, and prevent infected individuals from spreading that infection. Federal and state regulators have recognized this potential of telehealth and have quickly changed a variety of laws and regulations to enable healthcare providers to deploy solutions quickly. These changes can provide lasting benefits for the use of telehealth well after the current crisis. However, to best realize telehealth's benefits, further legal and regulatory actions are necessary. Specifically, lawmakers and regulators should focus on six areas: reimbursement, privacy/cybersecurity, liability, licensure, technology access, and artificial intelligence.", "The identification and treatment of patients with stroke is becoming increasingly complex as more treatment options become available and new relationships between disease features and treatment response are continually discovered. Consequently, clinicians must constantly learn new skills (such as clinical evaluations or image interpretation), stay up to date with the literature and incorporate advances into everyday practice. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support clinical decision making could reduce inter-rater variation in routine clinical practice and facilitate the extraction of vital information that could improve identification of patients with stroke, prediction of treatment responses and patient outcomes. Such support systems would be ideal for centres that deal with few patients with stroke or for regional hubs, and could assist informed discussions with the patients and their families. Moreover, the use of AI for image processing and interpretation in stroke could provide any clinician with an imaging assessment equivalent to that of an expert. However, any AI-based decision support system should allow for expert clinician interaction to enable identification of errors (for example, in automated image processing). In this Review, we discuss the increasing importance of imaging in stroke management before exploring the potential and pitfalls of AI-assisted treatment decision support in acute stroke.", "Elderly people affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) usually report a perceived decline in cognitive functions that deeply impacts their quality of life. This subtle waning, although it cannot be diagnosable as dementia, is noted by caregivers on the basis of their relative's behaviors. Crucially, if this condition is also not detected in time by clinicians, it can easily turn into dementia. Thus, early detection of MCI is strongly needed. Classical neuropsychological measures - underlying a categorical model of diagnosis - could be integrated with a dimensional assessment approach involving Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). VR can be used to create highly ecologically controlled simulations resembling the daily life contexts in which patients' daily instrumental activities (IADL) usually take place. Clinicians can record patients' kinematics, particularly gait, while performing IADL (Digital Biomarkers). Then, Artificial Intelligence employs Machine Learning (ML) to analyze them in combination with clinical and neuropsychological data. This integrated computational approach would enable the creation of a predictive model to identify specific patterns of cognitive and motor impairment in MCI. Therefore, this new dimensional cognitive-behavioral assessment would reveal elderly people's neural alterations and impaired cognitive functions, typical of MCI and dementia, even in early stages for more time-sensitive interventions.", "Reduced global hippocampus volumes have been demonstrated in premature-born individuals, from newborns to adults; however, it is unknown whether hippocampus subfield (HCSF) volumes are differentially affected by premature birth and how relevant they are for cognitive performance. To address these questions, we investigated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived HCSF volumes in very premature-born adults, and related them with general cognitive performance in adulthood. We assessed 103 very premature-born (gestational age [GA] <32\u2009weeks and/or birth weight <1,500\u2009g) and 109 term-born individuals with cognitive testing and structural MRI at 26\u2009years of age. HCSFs were automatically segmented based on three-dimensional T1- and T2-weighted sequences and studied both individually and grouped into three functional units, namely hippocampus proper (HP), subicular complex (SC), and dentate gyrus (DG). Cognitive performance was measured using the Wechsler-Adult-Intelligence-Scale (full-scale intelligence quotient [FS-IQ]) at 26\u2009years. We observed bilateral volume reductions for almost all HCSF volumes in premature-born adults and associations with GA and neonatal treatment intensity but not birth weight. Left-sided HP, SC, and DG volumes were associated with adult FS-IQ. Furthermore, left DG volume was a mediator of the association between GA and adult FS-IQ in premature-born individuals. Results demonstrate nonspecifically reduced HCSF volumes in premature-born adults; but specific associations with cognitive outcome highlight the importance of the left DG. Data suggest that specific interventions toward hippocampus function might be promising to lower adverse cognitive effects of prematurity.", "Although prior theory suggests that rumination contributes to cognitive impairments associated with depression, recent work suggests that rumination is associated with higher levels of intelligence. The present study examined the relations between two ruminative subtypes (brooding and reflective pondering) and multiple measures and types of intelligence (verbal and performance) after controlling for rumination's overlapping variance with depression. Participants were 751 individuals from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study who completed the Ruminative Response Scale; the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale and a fully structured clinical interview as measures of depression; and verbal and performance intelligence tasks at age 16 and the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices at age 23. Reflective pondering was positively associated with all measures of intelligence, whereas brooding was not associated with intelligence. Our findings indicate that any negative associations between rumination and intelligence are attributable to shared variance with depression, and that examination of rumination as a multifaceted construct may provide new insights into the relations between rumination and cognition.", "Enabling full interoperability within and between population-based patient-registry domains would open up access to a rich and unique source of health data for secondary data usage. Previous attempts to tackle patient-registry interoperability have met with varying degrees of success, but a unifying solution remains elusive. The purpose of this paper is to show by practical example how a solution is attainable via the implementation of an existing framework based of the concept of federated, semantic metadata registries. One important feature motivating the use of this framework is that it can be implemented gradually and independently within each patient-registry domain. By employing linked open data principles, the framework extends the ISO/IEC 11179 standard to provide both syntactic and semantic interoperability of data elements with the means of specifying automated extraction scripts for retrieval of data from different registry content models. The examples provided address the domain of European population-based cancer registries to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. One of the examples shows how quick gains are derivable by allowing retrieval of aggregated core data sets. The other examples show how aggregated full sets of data and record-level data might also be retrieved from each local registry. An infrastructure of patient-registry domains adhering to the principles of the framework would provide the semantic contexts and inter-linkage of data necessary for automated search and retrieval of registry data. It would thereby also lay the foundation for making registry data serviceable to artificial intelligence (AI) applications.", "Recently approved artificial intelligence (AI) software utilizes AI powered large vessel occlusion (LVO) detection technology which automatically identifies suspected LVO through CT angiogram (CTA) imaging and alerts on-call stroke teams. We performed this analysis to determine if utilization of AI software and workflow platform can reduce the transfer time (time interval between CTA at a primary stroke center (PSC) to door-in at a comprehensive stroke center (CSC)).\nWe compared the transfer time for all LVO transfer patients from a single spoke PSC to our CSC prior to and after incorporating AI Software (Viz.ai LVO). Using a prospectively collected stroke database at a CSC, demographics, mRS at discharge, mortality rate at discharge, length of stay (LOS) in hospital and neurological-ICU were examined.\nThere were a total of 43 patients during the study period (median age 72.0\u2009\u00b1\u200912.54 yrs., 51.16% women). Analysis of 28 patients from the pre-AI software (median age 73.5\u2009\u00b1\u200912.28 yrs., 46.4% women), and 15 patients from the post-AI software (median age 70.0\u2009\u00b1\u200913.29 yrs., 60.00% women). Following implementation of AI software, median CTA time at PSC to door-in at CSC was significantly reduced by an average of 22.5\u2009min. (132.5\u2009min versus 110\u2009min; p\u2009=\u20090.0470).\nThe incorporation of AI software was associated with an improvement in transfer times for LVO patients as well as a reduction in the overall hospital LOS and LOS in the neurological-ICU. More extensive studies are warranted to expand on the ability of AI technology to improve transfer times and outcomes for LVO patients.", "As the new cases of COVID-19 are growing every daysince January 2020, the major way to control the spread wasthrough early diagnosis. Prevention and early diagnosis are the key strategies followed by most countries. This study presents the perspective of different modes of transmission of coronavirus,especially during clinical practices and among the pediatrics. Further, the diagnostic methods and the advancement of the computerized tomography have been discussed. Droplets, aerosol, and close contact are thesignificantfactors to transfer the infection to the suspect. This study predicts the possible transmission of the virus through medical practices such as ophthalmology, dental, and endoscopy procedures. With regard to pediatric transmission, as of now, only afew child fatalities had been reported. Childrenusually respond to the respiratory virus; however, COVID-19 response ison the contrary. The possibility of getting infected is minimal for the newborn. There has been no asymptomatic spread in children until now. Moreover, breastfeedingwould not transmit COVID-19, which is encouraging hygiene news for the pediatric. In addition, the current diagnostic methods for COVID-19 including Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)and chest computed topography(CT) scan, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) andimmunochromatographic fluorescence assay, are also discussed in detail. The introduction of artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithmhas the ability to diagnose COVID-19 in precise. However, the developments of a potential technology for the identification of the infection, such as a drone with thermal screening without human intervention, need to be encouraged.", "Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is one of the main causes of hip pain in young adults and poses clinical challenges which have placed it at the forefront of imaging and orthopedics. Diagnostic hip imaging has dramatically changed in the past years, with the arrival of new imaging techniques and the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This article reviews the current state-of-the-art clinical routine of individuals with suspected FAI, limitations, and future directions that show promise in the field of musculoskeletal research and are likely to reshape hip imaging in the coming years.\nThe largely unknown natural disease course, especially in hips with FAI syndrome and those with asymptomatic abnormal morphologies, continues to be a problem as far as diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are concerned. There has been a paradigm shift in recent years from bone and soft tissue morphological analysis towards the tentative development of quantitative approaches, biochemical cartilage evaluation, dynamic assessment techniques and, finally, integration of artificial intelligence (AI)/deep learning systems. Imaging, AI, and hip preserving care will continue to evolve with new problems and greater challenges. The increasing number of analytic parameters describing the hip joint, as well as new sophisticated MRI and imaging analysis, have carried practitioners beyond simplistic classifications. Reliable evidence-based guidelines, beyond differentiation into pure instability or impingement, are paramount to refine the diagnostic algorithm and define treatment indications and prognosis. Nevertheless, the boundaries of morphological, functional, and AI-aided hip assessment are gradually being pushed to new frontiers as the role of musculoskeletal imaging is rapidly evolving.", "Recently, soft actuators have been expected to have many applications in various fields. Most of the actuators are composed of flexible materials and driven by air pressure. The 3-DOF micro-hand, which is a kind of soft actuator, can realize a three degrees of freedom motion by changing the applied air pressure pattern. However, the input-output relation is nonlinear and complicated. In previous research, a model of the micro-hand was proposed, but an error between the model and the experimental results was large. In this paper, modeling for the micro-hand is proposed by using multi-output support vector regression (MSVR) and ant colony optimization (ACO), which is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) methods. MSVR estimates the input-output relation of the micro-hand. ACO optimizes the parameters of the MSVR model.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a key supporting role in the fight against COVID-19 and perhaps will contribute to solutions quicker than we would otherwise achieve in many fields and applications. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there has been an upsurge in the exploration and use of AI, and other data analytic tools, in a multitude of areas. This paper addresses some of the many considerations for managing the development and deployment of AI applications, including planning; unpredictable, unexpected, or biased results; repurposing; the importance of data; and diversity in AI team membership. We provide implications for research and for practice, according to each of the considerations. Finally we conclude that we need to plan and carefully consider the issues associated with the development and use of AI as we look for quick solutions.", "Myometrial invasion affects the prognosis of endometrial cancer. However, discrepancies exist between pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging staging and post-operative pathological staging. This study aims to validate the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) for detecting the depth of myometrial invasion using a deep learning technique on magnetic resonance images. We obtained 4896 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (T1w) and T2-weighted images (T2w) from 72 patients who were diagnosed with surgico-pathological stage I endometrial carcinoma. We used the images from 24 patients (33.3%) to train the AI. The images from the remaining 48 patients (66.7%) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The AI then interpreted each of the cases and sorted them into stage IA or IB. Compared with the accuracy rate of radiologists' diagnoses (77.8%), the accuracy rate of AI interpretation in contrast-enhanced T1w was higher (79.2%), whereas that in T2w was lower (70.8%). The diagnostic accuracy was not significantly different between radiologists and AI for both T1w and T2w. However, AI was more likely to provide incorrect interpretations in patients with coexisting benign leiomyomas or polypoid tumors. Currently, the ability of this AI technology to make an accurate diagnosis has limitations. However, in hospitals with limited resources, AI may be able to assist in reading magnetic resonance images. We believe that AI has the potential to assist radiologists or serve as a reasonable alternative for pre-operative evaluation of the myometrial invasion depth of stage I endometrial cancers.", "Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients has considerable prognostic and treatment potential and can be tailored to individual patients as part of precision medicine protocols. This work reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence so as to enable the use of radiogenomics for accurate NAC analysis and prediction. The work addresses a new problem in radiogenomics mining: How to combine structural radiomics information and non-structural genomics information for accurate NAC prediction. This requires the automated extraction of parameters from structural breast radiomics data, and finding non-structural feature vectors with diagnostic value, which then are combined with genomics data acquired from exocrine bodies in blood samples from a cohort of cancer patients to enable accurate NAC prediction. A self-attention-based deep learning approach, along with an effective multi-channel tumour image reconstruction algorithm of high dimensionality, is proposed. The aim was to generate non-structural feature vectors for accurate prediction of the NAC responses by combining imaging datasets with exocrine body related genomics analysis.", "The large number of clinical variables associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection makes it challenging for frontline physicians to effectively triage COVID-19 patients during the pandemic. This study aimed to develop an efficient deep-learning artificial intelligence algorithm to identify top clinical variable predictors and derive a risk stratification score system to help clinicians triage COVID-19 patients.\nThis retrospective study consisted of 181 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from January 29, 2020 to March 21, 2020 from a major hospital in Wuhan, China. The primary outcome was mortality. Demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests were collected at initial presentation, totaling 78 clinical variables. A deep-learning algorithm and a risk stratification score system were developed to predict mortality. Data were split into 85% training and 15% testing. Prediction performance was compared with those using COVID-19 severity score, CURB-65 score, and pneumonia severity index (PSI).\nOf the 181 COVID-19 patients, 39 expired and 142 survived. Five top predictors of mortality were D-dimer, O2 Index, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. The top 5 predictors and the resultant risk score yielded, respectively, an area under curve (AUC) of 0.968 (95% CI = 0.87-1.0) and 0.954 (95% CI = 0.80-0.99) for the testing dataset. Our models outperformed COVID-19 severity score (AUC = 0.756), CURB-65 score (AUC = 0.671), and PSI (AUC = 0.838). The mortality rates for our risk stratification scores (0-5) were 0%, 0%, 6.7%, 18.2%, 67.7%, and 83.3%, respectively.\nDeep-learning prediction model and the resultant risk stratification score may prove useful in clinical decisionmaking under time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment.", "Many clinical trials with potential drug treatment options for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are focused on patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) stages 2 and 3 fibrosis. As the histological features differentiating stage 1 (F1) from stage 2 (F2) NASH fibrosis are subtle, some patients may be wrongly staged by the in-house pathologist and miss the opportunity for enrollment into clinical trials. We hypothesized that our refined artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm (qFibrosis) can identify these subtle differences and serve as an assistive tool for in-house pathologists.\nLiver tissue from 160 adult patients with biopsy-proven NASH from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Peking University People's Hospital (PKUH) were used. A consensus read by two expert hepatopathologists was organized. The refined qFibrosis algorithm incorporated the creation of a periportal region that allowed for the increased detection of periportal fibrosis. Consequently, an additional 28 periportal parameters were added, and 28 pre-existing perisinusoidal parameters had altered definitions.\nTwenty-eight parameters (20 periportal and 8 perisinusoidal) were significantly different between the F1 and F2 cases that prompted a change of stage after a careful consensus read. The discriminatory ability of these parameters was further demonstrated in a comparison between the true F1 and true F2 cases as 26 out of the 28 parameters showed significant differences. These 26 parameters constitute a novel sub-algorithm that could accurately stratify F1 and F2 cases.\nThe refined qFibrosis algorithm incorporated 26 novel parameters that showed a good discriminatory ability for NASH fibrosis stage 1 and 2 cases, representing an invaluable assistive tool for in-house pathologists when screening patients for NASH clinical trials.", "The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that led to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic, has resulted in substantial overburdening of healthcare systems as well as an economic crisis on a global scale. This has in turn resulted in widespread efforts to identify suitable therapies to address this aggressive pathogen. Therapeutic antibody and vaccine development are being actively explored, and a phase I clinical trial of mRNA-1273 which is developed in collaboration between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Moderna, Inc. is currently underway. Timelines for the broad deployment of a vaccine and antibody therapies have been estimated to be 12-18\u2009months or longer. These are promising approaches that may lead to sustained efficacy in treating COVID-19. However, its emergence has also led to a large number of clinical trials evaluating drug combinations composed of repurposed therapies. As study results of these combinations continue to be evaluated, there is a need to move beyond traditional drug screening and repurposing by harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize combination therapy design. This may lead to the rapid identification of regimens that mediate unexpected and markedly enhanced treatment outcomes.", "The Medical Futurist says that radiology is one of the fastest growing and developing areas of medicine, and therefore this might be the speciality in which we can expect to see the largest steps in development. So why do they think that, and does it apply to dose monitoring? The move from retrospective dose evaluation to a proactive dose management approach represents a serious area of research. Indeed, artificial intelligence and machine learning are consistently being integrated into best-in-class dose management software solutions. The development of clinical analytics and dashboards are already supporting operators in their decision-making, and these optimisations - if taken beyond a single machine, a single department, or a single health network - have the potential to drive real and lasting change. The question is for whom exactly are these innovations being developed? How can the patient know that their scan has been performed to the absolute best that the technology can deliver? Do they know or even care how much their lifetime risk for developing cancer has changed post examination? Do they want a personalised size-specific dose estimate or perhaps an individual organ dose assessment to share on Instagram? Let's get real about the clinical utility and regulatory application of dose monitoring, and shine a light on the shared responsibility in applying the technology and the associated innovations.", "Our work has been carried out with the aim of providing a solution to decision-making problems encountered in information systems for supply chains in crisis situation. The supply chain represents a competitive advantage that companies seek to perpetuate. It aims to optimize the exchanges, or flows, that the company maintains with its suppliers and its customers. These flows can be of various natures. It can be information flows relating to supplies or product design, financial flows linked to purchases, or even flows of goods. The crisis management logistics is getting more and more attention, especially in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. For these systems, where it is never very easy to anticipate the evolution of the environment, the forms of changes undergone are varied and rapid. We aim to provide an answer to these challenges, in an approach that links optimization methods to the paradigm of artificial intelligence. We therefore propose to find mathematical models, and inter-agent cooperation protocols, to minimize the risk of stock shortage in any area of \u200b\u200bthe supply chain.", "Patients with diabetes mellitus have a lifetime risk of 15% to 25% of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). DFU is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Wound imaging systems are useful adjuncts in monitoring of wound progress. Our study aims to review existing literature on the available wound assessment and monitoring systems for DFU. This is a systematic review of articles from PubMed and Embase (1974 - March 2020). All studies related to wound assessment or monitoring systems in DFUs were included. Articles on other types of wounds, review articles, and non-English texts were excluded. Outcomes include clinical use, wound measurement statistics, hospital system integration, and other advantages and challenges. The search identified 531 articles. Seventeen full-text studies were eligible for the final analysis. Five modalities were identified: (a) computer applications or hand-held devices (n = 5), (b) mobile applications (n = 2), (c) optical imaging (n = 2), (d) spectroscopy or hyperspectral imaging (n = 4), and (e) artificial intelligence (n = 4). Most studies (n = 16) reported on wound assessment or monitoring. Only one study reported on data capturing. Two studies on the use of computer applications reported low inter-observer variability in wound measurement (inter-rater reliability >0.99, and inter-observer variability 15.9% respectively). Hand-held commercial devices demonstrated high accuracy (relative error of 2.1%-6.8%). Use of spectroscopy or hyperspectral imaging in prediction of wound healing has a sensitivity and specificity of 80% to 90% and 74%to 86%, respectively. Majority of the commercially available wound assessment systems have not been reviewed in the literature on measurement accuracy. In conclusion, most imaging systems are superior to traditional wound assessment. Wound imaging systems should be used as adjuncts in DFU monitoring.", "This paper argues that data-driven medicine gives rise to a particular normative challenge. Against the backdrop of a distinction between the good and the right, harnessing personal health data towards the development and refinement of data-driven medicine is to be welcomed from the perspective of the good. Enacting solidarity drives progress in research and clinical practice. At the same time, such acts of sharing could-especially considering current developments in big data and artificial intelligence-compromise the right by leading to injustices and affecting concrete modes of individual self-determination. In order to address this potential tension, two key elements for ethical reflection on data-driven medicine are proposed: the controllability of information flows, including\u00a0technical\u00a0infrastructures that are conducive towards controllability, and a paradigm shift towards output-orientation in governance and policy.", "The study evaluates the plausibility and applicability of prediction, pattern recognition and modelling of complications post-endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) by artificial intelligence for more accurate surveillance in practice.\nA single-centre prospective data collection on (n\u2009=\u2009250) EVAR cases with n\u2009=\u200926 preoperative attributes (factors) on endpoint of endoleak (types I-VI), occlusion, migration and mortality over a 13-year period was conducted. In addition to the traditional statistical analysis, data was subjected to machine learning algorithm through artificial neural network. The predictive accuracy (specificity and -1 sensitivity) on each endpoint is presented with percentage and receiver operative curve. The pattern recognition and model classification were conducted using discriminate analysis, decision tree, logistic regression, naive Bayes and support vector machines, and the best fit model was deployed for pattern recognition and modelling.\nThe accuracy of the training, validation and predictive ability of artificial neural network in detection of endoleak type I was 95, 96 and 94%, type II (94, 83, 90 and 82%) and type III was 96, 94 and 96%, respectively. Endpoints are associated with increase in weights through predictive modeling that were not detected through statistical analytics. The overall accuracy of the model was\u2009>86%.\nThe study highlights the applicability, accuracy and reliability of artificial intelligence in the detection of adverse outcomes post-EVAR for an accurate surveillance stratification.", "Despite the importance of emotional intelligence, its biological mechanism is still not well understood. For this reason, we have developed a rodent detour task which requires an animal to reach a highly desired object placed directly behind a transparent barrier that blocks the direct route to the target. This apparently simple task is highly dependent on the emotional control that is necessary to inhibit prepotent and counterproductive responses driven by the sight of a desired object. The water escape detour task designed for mice enables testing the ability to solve emotionally challenging problems, as well as identification of an impairment termed perseveration. Such a maladaptive reaction to a challenging situation is characterized by difficulty in terminating an unsuccessful response, leading to persistent repetition of inappropriate behavior. This issue is important because perseveration is associated with schizophrenia, drug abuse, and aging. \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

This study sought to compare public attitudes toward stuttering, obesity, and mental illness as well as to identify the predictive potential of four ratings relating to these and other neutral or desirable conditions. Method Five hundred respondents who were selected from each of three international databases filled out the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes (POSHA) for stuttering, obesity, or mental illness. The POSHA surveys were as similar as possible, and all contained four general items asking respondents' \"impression\" of the attribute, extent to which he or she \"wants to be/have\" that attribute, \"amount known\" about the attribute, and \"persons known\" who manifest the attribute, for stuttering, obesity, and mental illness plus two others, namely, left-handedness and intelligence. The POSHA surveys also had the same summary scores, Beliefs, Self-Reactions, and an Overall Score. Results Summary scores for the three POSHA surveys in the 500-respondent samples revealed negative attitudes toward all three conditions, the most positive being toward obesity, followed by stuttering and then by mental illness. Stepwise regression analysis indicated that various general items had significant prediction potential not only of attitudes for the same condition but also of attitudes for other conditions. The greatest other condition predictions were between stuttering and mental illness. Conclusions Stuttering is regarded as less stigmatizing than mental illness but more stigmatizing than obesity. Additionally, positivity toward one condition results in limited positivity toward the others. Impressions and knowledge of-as well as experience with-stigmatized conditions can inform public awareness campaigns and individual clinical programs dealing with stigma.

In computed tomography (CT), AI holds the promise of enabling further reductions in patient radiation dose through automation and optimisation of data acquisition processes, including patient positioning and acquisition parameter settings. Subsequent to data collection, optimisation of image reconstruction parameters, advanced reconstruction algorithms, and image denoising methods improve several aspects of image quality, especially in reducing image noise and enabling the use of lower radiation doses for data acquisition. Finally, AI-based methods to automatically segment organs or detect and characterise pathology have been translated out of the research environment and into clinical practice to bring automation, increased sensitivity, and new clinical applications to patient care, ultimately increasing the benefit to the patient from medically justified CT examinations. In summary, since the introduction of CT, a large number of technical advances have enabled increased clinical benefit and decreased patient risk, not only by reducing radiation dose, but also by reducing the likelihood of errors in the performance and interpretation of medically justified CT examinations.", "Schema modes (or modes) are a key concept in the theory underlying schema therapy. Modes have rarely been related to established models of personality traits. The present study thus investigates the associations between trait emotional intelligence (TEI) and 14 modes, and tests a global TEI-mode factors-general psychological distress mediation model. The study draws on self-report data from 173 inpatients from a German clinic for psychosomatic medicine. Global TEI correlated positively with both healthy modes (happy child and healthy adult) and negatively with 10 maladaptive modes. When modes were regressed on the four TEI factors, six (emotionality), five (well-being), four (sociability), and four (self-control) significant partial effects on 10 modes emerged. In the parallel mediation model, the mode factors internalization and compulsivity fully mediated the global TEI-general psychological distress link. Implications of the results for the integration of modes with traits in general and with TEI in particular as well as implications of low TEI as a transdiagnostic feature of personality malfunctioning are discussed.", "As part of the urgent need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments, healthcare providers, and businesses have looked to applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to compensate for the unavailability of human workers. This interest has renewed the debate regarding the use of AI for the automation of work, which has been described as Intelligent Automation (IA). A new dimension to this debate is whether COVID-19 will be the catalyst for higher IA adoption levels. This article reviews arguments in favour of COVID-19 increasing the level of IA adoption and possible counter-arguments. Key arguments in favour of increased IA adoption include consumer preferences changing to favour IA, increasing familiarity of IA technologies, and increased business confidence in IA. Counter-arguments include big data availability and reliability limitations, many tasks still favouring human skills over IA, the narrow capabilities of IA technologies, and a high availability of human workers. The article also discusses the implications of this debate for information management research and practice.", "There has been growing investment in artificial intelligence (AI) interventions to combat the opioid-driven overdose epidemic plaguing North America. Although the evidence for the use of technology and AI in medicine is mounting, there are a number of ethical, social, and political implications that need to be considered when designing AI interventions. In this commentary, we describe 2 key areas that will require ethical deliberation in order to ensure that AI is being applied ethically with socially vulnerable populations such as people who use drugs: (1) perpetuation of biases in data and (2) consent. We offer ways forward to guide and provide opportunities for interventionists to develop substance use-related AI technologies that account for the inherent biases embedded within conventional data systems. This includes a discussion of how other data generation techniques (eg, qualitative and community-based approaches) can be integrated within AI intervention development efforts to mitigate the limitations of relying on electronic health record data. Finally, we emphasize the need to involve people who use drugs as stakeholders in all phases of AI intervention development.", "Children with extremely low-birth weight (ELBW) have a high risk for cognitive, motor, and attention impairments and learning disabilities. Longitudinal follow-up studies to a later age are needed in order to increase understanding of the changes in neurodevelopmental trajectories in targeting timely intervention. The aims of this study were to investigate cognitive and motor outcomes, attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) behaviour, school performance, and overall outcomes in a national cohort of ELBW children at preadolescence, and minor neuromotor impairments in a subpopulation of these children and to compare the results with those of full-term controls. The additional aim was to report the overall outcome in all ELBW infants born at 22 to 26 gestational weeks.\nThis longitudinal prospective national cohort study included all surviving ELBW (birth weight <1000\u2009g) children born in Finland in 1996 to 1997. No children were excluded from the study. Perinatal, neonatal, and follow-up data up to the age of 5\u2009years of these children were registered in the national birth register. According to birth register, the study population included all infants born at the age under 27 gestational weeks. At 11\u2009years of age general cognitive ability was tested with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, ADHD behavior evaluated with a report from each child's own teacher (ADHD Rating Scale IV), and school performance with a parental questionnaire. An ELBW subpopulation consisting of a cohort representative children from the two university hospitals from two regions (n = 63) and the age-matched full-term born controls born in Helsinki university hospital (n = 30) underwent Movement Assessment Battery for Children and Touwen neurological examination comprising developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and minor neurological dysfunction (MND), respectively.\nOf 206 ELBW survivors 122 (73% of eligible) children and 30 (100%) full-term control children participated in assessments. ELBW children had lower full-scale intellectual quotient than controls (t-test, 90 vs 112, P <\u2009.001), elevated teacher- reported inattention scores (median = 4.0 vs 1.0, P =\u2009.021, r =\u2009.20) and needed more educational support (47% vs 17%, OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.6-12.4, P =\u2009.02). In the subpopulation, the incidences of DCD were 30% in ELBW and 7% in control children (P =\u2009.012, OR 6.0 CI 1.3-27.9), and complex MND 12.5% and 0%, (P =\u2009.052; RR 1.1 95% CI 1.04-1.25), respectively. Of survivors born in 24 to 26 gestational weeks, 29% had normal outcome.\nAs the majority of the extremely preterm born children had some problems, long-term follow-up is warranted to identify those with special needs and to design individual multidisciplinary support programs.", "Estimates in a 1989 study indicated that physicians in the United States were unable to reach a diagnosis that accounted for their patient's symptoms in up to 90% of outpatient patient encounters. Many proponents of artificial intelligence (AI) see the current process of moving from clinical data gathering to medical diagnosis as being limited by human analytic capability and expect AI to be a valuable tool to refine this process. The use of AI fundamentally calls into question the extent to which uncertainty in medical decision making is tolerated. Uncertainty is perceived by some as fundamentally undesirable and thus, for them, optimal decision making should be based on minimizing uncertainty. However, uncertainty cannot be reduced to zero; thus, relative uncertainty can be used as a metric to weigh the likelihood of various diagnoses being correct and the appropriateness of treatments. Here, the authors make the argument, using as examples the experiences of 2 AI systems, IBM Watson on Jeopardy and Watson for Oncology, that medical decision making based on relative uncertainty provides a better lens for understanding the application of AI to medicine than one that minimizes uncertainty. This approach to uncertainty has significant implications for how health care leaders consider the benefits and trade-offs of AI-assisted and AI-driven decision tools and ultimately integrate AI into medical practice.", "Ultrasonography is widely used in the clinical diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Ultrasound images of thyroid nodules have different appearances, interior features, and blurred borders that are difficult for a physician to diagnose into malignant or benign types merely through visual recognition. The development of artificial intelligence, especially deep learning, has led to great advances in the field of medical image diagnosis. However, there are some challenges to achieve precision and efficiency in the recognition of thyroid nodules. In this work, we propose a deep learning architecture, you only look once v3 dense multireceptive fields convolutional neural network (YOLOv3-DMRF), based on YOLOv3. It comprises a DMRF-CNN and multiscale detection layers. In DMRF-CNN, we integrate dilated convolution with different dilation rates to continue passing the edge and the texture features to deeper layers. Two different scale detection layers are deployed to recognize the different sizes of the thyroid nodules. We used two datasets to train and evaluate the YOLOv3-DMRF during the experiments. One dataset includes 699 original ultrasound images of thyroid nodules collected from a local health physical center. We obtained 10,485 images after data augmentation. Another dataset is an open-access dataset that includes ultrasound images of 111 malignant and 41 benign thyroid nodules. Average precision (AP) and mean average precision (mAP) are used as the metrics for quantitative and qualitative evaluations. We compared the proposed YOLOv3-DMRF with some state-of-the-art deep learning networks. The experimental results show that YOLOv3-DMRF outperforms others on mAP and detection time on both the datasets. Specifically, the values of mAP and detection time were 90.05 and 95.23% and 3.7 and 2.2\u2009s, respectively, on the two test datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed YOLOv3-DMRF is efficient for detection and recognition of thyroid nodules for ultrasound images.", "Public policies are designed to have an impact on particular societies, yet policy-oriented computer models and simulations often focus more on articulating the policies to be applied than on realistically rendering the cultural dynamics of the target society. This approach can lead to policy assessments that ignore crucial social contextual factors. For example, by leaving out distinctive moral and normative dimensions of cultural contexts in artificial societies, estimations of downstream policy effectiveness fail to account for dynamics that are fundamental in human life and central to many public policy challenges. In this paper, we supply evidence that incorporating morally salient dimensions of a culture is critically important for producing relevant and accurate evaluations of social policy when using multi-agent artificial intelligence models and simulations.", "Mental health is an essential issue during adolescence. The number of students who use counseling services is increasing in universities. We attempted to confirm the characteristics of the students who access counseling services using both psychological tests and pulse rate variability (PRV) for better support for students' academic success.\nWe recruited the participants for this study from the students who had counseling sessions at Kanazawa University (Group S). As a control group, we also recruited students who had no experience in counseling services (Group H). We obtained health information from the database of annual health checkups. Participants received the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III, Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Sukemune-Hiew (S-H) Resilience Test, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-JYZ (STAI). We also studied the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12v2) for testing Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL). As a physiological test, we examined the spectral analyses of pulse rate variability (PRV) by accelerating plethysmography. We performed a linear analysis of PRV for low-frequency power (LF: 0.02-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency power (HF: 0.15-0.50 Hz). We also conducted a non-linear analysis of PRV for the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE). Additionally, we examined participants' blood for autoantibodies against glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65.\nA total of 105 students participated in this study. Group S had 37 participants (Male: 26, Female: 11), and Group H had 68 participants (Male: 27, Female 41). There were five males and one female in Group S who had diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and three males in Group S were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by medical institutes. Additionally, four males and two females in Group S had diagnoses of ASD with ADHD by medical institutes. A male with ASD in Group S had epilepsy. The students of Group S had characteristics as follows: 1) lower power of Working Memory Index (WMI) despite high Full-Scale Intelligent Quotient (FSIQ), 2) higher ASD traits especially in Male, 3) lower resilience powers, 4) higher anxiety trait, 5) lower Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in Role/social component in both Male and Female, 6) lower HRQOL in Mental component in Male 7) shifting of autonomic nervous balance toward higher sympathetic activity.\nWe could confirm the characteristics of students who visited counseling rooms for mental support (Group S). We also found gender differences in specificities of Group S. The educational system is changing rapidly to adjust social requests. These changes make conflict with the features of students of Group S. We should think about appropriate supports for the students who would pioneer the future of humanity.", "From its origins in epidemiology, evidence-based medicine has promulgated a rigorous approach to assessing the validity, impact and applicability of hypothesis-driven empirical research used to evaluate the utility of diagnostic tests, prognostic tools and therapeutic interventions. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, uses computer programs to discover patterns and associations within huge datasets which are then incorporated into algorithms used to assist diagnoses and predict future outcomes, including response to therapies. How do these two fields relate to one another? What are their similarities and differences, their strengths and weaknesses? Can each learn from, and complement, the other in rendering clinical decision-making more informed and effective?", "Modern western civilization reached a pinnacle in the last half of the 20th century, spending over 200 years evolving and spreading throughout the world. A robust social contract, technological advancement and pervasive economic success in the context of democracy and capitalism propelled the project. Unfortunately, two underlying pillars of past success developed intensifying negative consequences, hastening socioeconomic decline: insatiable collective wants and global population growth. The rise and decline of civilizations in history is well documented, yet oddly ignored in today's dialogue. Contemporary civilization is assumed to be immune from forces that shaped cycles of past civilizations-that our age is somehow an exception. For the first time in human history planetary systems that seemed invisible until recently are sending us the message that our civilization is not exceptional, that there are finite limits to the thrust of humanity's present trajectory. Viable solutions curbing the effects of habitat destruction, diminishing biodiversity and climate change along with rising inequality, debt, conflict and refugee flows are known but unimplementable. The current essay examines underlying causes of socioeconomic deterioration and entrapment, suggesting a comprehensive collective intelligence enterprise be launched to prepare for the global transition facing humanity.", "The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a public health problem once according to the World Health Organization up to June 24th, 2020, more than 9.1 million people were infected, and more than 470 thousand have died worldwide. In the current scenario, the Brazil and the United States of America present a high daily incidence of new cases and deaths. Therefore, it is important to forecast the number of new cases in a time window of one week, once this can help the public health system developing strategic planning to deals with the COVID-19. The application of the forecasting artificial intelligence (AI) models has the potential of deal with dynamical behavior of time-series like of COVID-19. In this paper, Bayesian regression neural network, cubist regression, k-nearest neighbors, quantile random forest, and support vector regression, are used stand-alone, and coupled with the recent pre-processing variational mode decomposition (VMD) employed to decompose the time series into several intrinsic mode functions. All AI techniques are evaluated in the task of time-series forecasting with one, three, and six-days-ahead the cumulative COVID-19 cases in five Brazilian and American states, with a high number of cases up to April 28th, 2020. Previous cumulative COVID-19 cases and exogenous variables as daily temperature and precipitation were employed as inputs for all forecasting models. The models' effectiveness are evaluated based on the performance criteria. In general, the hybridization of VMD outperformed single forecasting models regarding the accuracy, specifically when the horizon is six-days-ahead, the hybrid VMD-single models achieved better accuracy in 70% of the cases. Regarding the exogenous variables, the importance ranking as predictor variables is, from the upper to the lower, past cases, temperature, and precipitation. Therefore, due to the efficiency of evaluated models to forecasting cumulative COVID-19 cases up to six-days-ahead, the adopted models can be recommended as a promising models for forecasting and be used to assist in the development of public policies to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak.", "A molecular robot is a microorganism-imitating micro robot that is designed from the molecular level and constructed by bottom-up approaches. As with conventional robots, molecular robots consist of three essential robotics elements: control of intelligent systems, sensors, and actuators, all integrated into a single micro compartment. Due to recent developments in microfluidic technologies, DNA nanotechnologies, synthetic biology, and molecular engineering, these individual parts have been developed, with the final picture beginning to come together. In this review, we describe recent developments of these sensors, actuators, and intelligence systems that can be applied to liposome-based molecular robots. First, we explain liposome generation for the compartments of molecular robots. Next, we discuss the emergence of robotics functions by using and functionalizing liposomal membranes. Then, we discuss actuators and intelligence via the encapsulation of chemicals into liposomes. Finally, the future vision and the challenges of molecular robots are described.", "Current approaches to quantification of magnetic particle imaging (MPI) for cell-based therapy are thwarted by the lack of reliable, standardized methods of segmenting the signal from background in images. This calls for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems for MPI analysis.\nWe utilize a canonical algorithm in the domain of unsupervised machine learning, known as K-means++, to segment the regions of interest (ROI) of images and perform iron quantification analysis using a standard curve model. We generated in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo data using islets and mouse models and applied the AI algorithm to gain insight into segmentation and iron prediction on these MPI data. In vitro models included imaging the VivoTrax-labeled islets in varying numbers. In vivo mouse models were generated through transplantation of increasing numbers of the labeled islets under the kidney capsule of mice. Ex vivo data were obtained from the MPI images of excised kidney grafts.\nThe K-means++ algorithms segmented the ROI of in vitro phantoms with minimal noise. A linear correlation between the islet numbers and the increasing prediction of total iron value (TIV) in the islets was observed. Segmentation results of the ROI of the in vivo MPI scans showed that with increasing number of transplanted islets, the signal intensity increased with linear trend. Upon segmenting the ROI of ex vivo data, a linear trend was observed in which increasing intensity of the ROI yielded increasing TIV of the islets. Through statistical evaluation of the algorithm performance via intraclass correlation coefficient validation, we observed excellent performance of K-means++-based model on segmentation and quantification analysis of MPI data.\nWe have demonstrated the ability of the K-means++-based model to provide a standardized method of segmentation and quantification of MPI scans in an islet transplantation mouse model.", "Digital technologies are changing the nature of teamwork in ways that have important implications for leadership. Though conceptually rich and multi-disciplinary, much of the burgeoning work on technology has not been fully integrated into the leadership literature. To fill this gap, we organize existing work on leadership and technology, outlining four perspectives: (1) technology as context, (2) technology as sociomaterial, (3) technology as creation medium, and (4) technology as teammate. Each technology perspective makes assumptions about how technologies affect teams and the needs for team leadership. Within each perspective, we detail current work on leading teams. This section takes us from virtual teams to new vistas posed by leading online communities, crowds, peer production groups, flash teams, human-robot teams, and human-artificial intelligence teams. We identify 12 leadership implications arising from the ways digital technologies affect organizing. We then leverage our review to identify directions for future leadership research and practice.", "During exploratory visual analysis (EVA), analysts need to continually determine which subsequent activities to perform, such as which data variables to explore or how to present data variables visually. Due to the vast combinations of data variables and visual encodings that are possible, it is often challenging to make such decisions. Further, while performing local explorations, analysts often fail to attend to the holistic picture that is emerging from their analysis, leading them to improperly steer their EVA. These issues become even more impactful in the real world analysis scenarios where EVA occurs in multiple asynchronous sessions that could be completed by one or more analysts. To address these challenges, this work proposes ChartSeer, a system that uses machine intelligence to enable analysts to visually monitor the current state of an EVA and effectively identify future activities to perform. ChartSeer utilizes deep learning techniques to characterize analyst-created data charts to generate visual summaries and recommend appropriate charts for further exploration based on user interactions. A case study was first conducted to demonstrate the usage of ChartSeer in practice, followed by a controlled study to compare ChartSeer's performance with a baseline during EVA tasks. The results demonstrated that ChartSeer enables analysts to adequately understand current EVA status and advance their analysis by creating charts with increased coverage and visual encoding diversity.", "Despite advances in business intelligence software and evidence that feedback to doctors can improve outcomes, objective feedback regarding patient outcomes for individual anaesthetists is hampered by lack of useful benchmarks. We aimed to address this issue by producing case-mix and risk-adjusted postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) length of stay (LOS) benchmarks for integration into modern reporting tools.\nWe extended existing hospital information systems to calculate predicted PACU LOS using a neural network trained on patient age, surgery duration, sex, operating specialty, urgency, weekday, and insurance status (n=100 511). We then calculated the difference between observed mean and predicted PACU LOS for individual doctors, and compared the results with and without case-mix adjustment. We report practical implications of using visual analytics dashboards displaying the difference between observed and predicted PACU LOS to provide feedback to anaesthetic doctors.\nThe neural network accounted for over half of observed variation in individual doctors' mean PACU LOS (mean predicted and mean actual LOS Spearman's r2=0.57). Account for case-mix reduced apparent spread, with 80% of individual doctors falling in a band of 4.3 min after case-mix adjusting, compared with a range of 24 min without adjustment. Case-mix adjusting also identified different individual doctors as outliers (Weighted Cohen's kappa [\u03ba]=0.27). Finally, we demonstrated that we were able to integrate the adjusted metrics into routine reporting tools.\nWith caution, case-mix adjustment of anaesthetic outcome measures such as PACU LOS potentially provides a useful continuous quality improvement tool. Unadjusted outcome measures are imprecise at best and misleading at worst.", "The human brain organoid is a miniature three-dimensional tissue culture that can simulate the structure and function of the brain in an in vitro culture environment. Although we consider that human brain organoids could be used to understand brain development and diseases, experimental models of human brain organoids are so highly variable that we apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to investigate the development mechanism of the human brain. Therefore, this study briefly reviewed commonly used AI applications for human brain organoid-magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, and gene editing techniques, as well as related AI algorithms. Finally, we discussed the limitations, challenges, and future study direction of AI-based technology for human brain organoids.", "Ageing is commonly associated with changes to segregation and integration of functional brain networks, but, in isolation, current network-based approaches struggle to elucidate changes across the many axes of functional organisation. However, the advent of gradient mapping techniques in neuroimaging provides a new means of studying functional organisation in a multi-dimensional connectivity space. Here, we studied ageing and behaviourally-relevant differences in a three-dimensional connectivity space using the Cambridge Centre for Ageing Neuroscience cohort (n = 643). Building on gradient mapping techniques, we developed a set of measures to quantify the dispersion within and between functional communities. We detected a strong shift of the visual network across the adult lifespan from an extreme to a more central position in the 3D gradient space. In contrast, the dispersion distance between transmodal communities (dorsal attention, ventral attention, frontoparietal and default mode) did not change. However, these communities themselves were increasingly dispersed with increasing age, reflecting more dissimilar functional connectivity profiles within each community. Increasing dispersion of frontoparietal, attention and default mode networks, in particular, were associated negatively with cognition, measured by fluid intelligence. By using a technique that explicitly captures the ordering of functional systems in a multi-dimensional hierarchical framework, we identified behaviorally-relevant age-related differences of within and between network organisation. We propose that the study of functional gradients across the adult lifespan could provide insights that may facilitate the development of new strategies to maintain cognitive ability across the lifespan in health and disease.", "More than half of stroke patients live with different levels of motor dysfunction after receiving routine rehabilitation treatments. Therefore, new rehabilitation technologies are urgently needed as auxiliary treatments for motor rehabilitation. Based on routine rehabilitation treatments, a new intelligent rehabilitation platform has been developed for accurate evaluation of function and rehabilitation training. The emerging intelligent rehabilitation techniques can promote the development of motor function rehabilitation in terms of informatization, standardization, and intelligence. Traditional assessment methods are mostly subjective, depending on the experience and expertise of clinicians, and lack standardization and precision. It is therefore difficult to track functional changes during the rehabilitation process. Emerging intelligent rehabilitation techniques provide objective and accurate functional assessment for stroke patients that can promote improvement of clinical guidance for treatment. Artificial intelligence and neural networks play a critical role in intelligent rehabilitation. Multiple novel techniques, such as brain-computer interfaces, virtual reality, neural circuit-magnetic stimulation, and robot-assisted therapy, have been widely used in the clinic. This review summarizes the emerging intelligent rehabilitation techniques for the evaluation and treatment of motor dysfunction caused by nervous system diseases.", "There exists a moderate correlation between MRI-measured brain size and the general factor of IQ performance (g), but the question of whether the association reflects a theoretically important causal relationship or spurious confounding remains somewhat open. Previous small studies (n < 100) looking for the persistence of this correlation within families failed to find a tendency for the sibling with the larger brain to obtain a higher test score. We studied the within-family relationship between brain volume and intelligence in the much larger sample provided by the Human Connectome Project (n = 1,022) and found a highly significant correlation (disattenuated \u03c1 = 0.18, p < .001). We replicated this result in the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research (n = 2,698), finding a highly significant within-family correlation between head circumference and intelligence (disattenuated \u03c1 = 0.19, p < .001). We also employed novel methods of causal inference relying on summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of head size (n \u2248 10,000) and measures of cognition (257,000 < n < 767,000). Using bivariate LD Score regression, we found a genetic correlation between intracranial volume (ICV) and years of education (EduYears) of 0.41 (p < .001). Using the Latent Causal Variable method, we found a genetic causality proportion of 0.72 (p < .001); thus the genetic correlation arises from an asymmetric pattern, extending to sub-significant loci, of genetic variants associated with ICV also being associated with EduYears but many genetic variants associated with EduYears not being associated with ICV. This is the pattern of genetic results expected from a causal effect of brain size on intelligence. These findings give reason to take up the hypothesis that the dramatic increase in brain volume over the course of human evolution has been the result of natural selection favoring general intelligence.", "Systematic screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been widely recommended for early detection in patients with diabetes to address preventable vision loss. However, substantial manpower and financial resources are required to deploy opportunistic screening and transition to systematic DR screening programs. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies may improve access and reduce the financial burden for DR screening while maintaining comparable or enhanced clinical effectiveness. To deploy an AI-based DR screening program in a real-world setting, it is imperative that health economic assessment (HEA) and patient safety analyses are conducted to guide appropriate allocation of resources and design safe, reliable systems. Few studies published to date include these considerations when integrating AI-based solutions into DR screening programs. In this article, we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art of AI technology (focusing on deep learning systems), followed by an appraisal of existing literature on the applications of AI in ophthalmology. We also discuss practical considerations that drive the development of a successful DR screening program, such as the implications of false-positive or false-negative results and image gradeability. Finally, we examine different plausible methods for HEA and safety analyses that can be used to assess concerns regarding AI-based screening.", "Cochlear implantation constitutes a successful therapy of inner ear deafness, with the majority of patients showing good outcomes. There is, however, still some unexplained variability in outcomes with a number of cochlear-implant (CI) users, showing major limitations in speech comprehension. The current study used a multimodal diagnostic approach combining single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the mechanisms underlying speech processing in postlingually deafened CI users (N = 21). In one session, the participants performed a speech discrimination task, during which a 96-channel EEG was recorded and the perfusions marker 99mTc-HMPAO was injected intravenously. The SPECT scan was acquired 1.5 h after injection to measure the cortical activity during the speech task. The second session included a SPECT scan after injection without stimulation at rest. Analysis of EEG and SPECT data showed N400 and P600 event-related potentials (ERPs) particularly evoked by semantic violations in the sentences, and enhanced perfusion in a temporo-frontal network during task compared to rest, involving the auditory cortex bilaterally and Broca's area. Moreover, higher performance in testing for word recognition and verbal intelligence strongly correlated to the activation in this network during the speech task. However, comparing CI users with lower and higher speech intelligibility [median split with cutoff + 7.6 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the G\u00f6ttinger sentence test] revealed for CI users with higher performance additional activations of parietal and occipital regions and for those with lower performance stronger activation of superior frontal areas. Furthermore, SPECT activity was tightly coupled with EEG and cognitive abilities, as indicated by correlations between (1) cortical activation and the amplitudes in EEG, N400 (temporal and occipital areas)/P600 (parietal and occipital areas) and (2) between cortical activation in left-sided temporal and bilateral occipital/parietal areas and working memory capacity. These results suggest the recruitment of a temporo-frontal network in CI users during speech processing and a close connection between ERP effects and cortical activation in CI users. The observed differences in speech-evoked cortical activation patterns for CI users with higher and lower speech intelligibility suggest distinct processing strategies during speech rehabilitation with CI.", "To systematically investigate causal relationships between educational attainment, cognitive-related phenotypes, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\nSummary statistics from genome-wide association studies for educational attainment, math ability, highest math class taken, cognitive performance, intelligence, and ALS were used. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design was applied to explore the potential causal associations between them.\nGenetically predisposition to longer educational attainment and harder math class taken were associated with significantly lower statistical odds ratio of ALS. For per year increase in education completed there was a 21% lower (95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a027-14%) in risk for ALS. For per 1-SD increase in the highest math class taken obtained there was a 19% lower (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a09-28%) in risk for ALS. Genetically predisposition to math ability, cognitive performance, and intelligence did not decrease the risk of ALS.\nThis study provides genetic support for a causal association between higher educational attainment and a lower risk of ALS. The genes related to these phenotypes are involved in almost all aspects of neuron-to-neuron communication. ALS patients are occasionally accompanied by varying degrees of cognitive impairment. People with greater cognitive reserve may be better able to offset damages of degenerative brain changes associated with dementia or other brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or ALS.", "Subjective wellbeing has been conceptualized as a person's cognitive and affective evaluation of their life. In this line, life satisfaction and somatic complaints may be outstanding indicators of well-being. The aim of this longitudinal study was to analyze the combined contribution of trait emotional intelligence, self-esteem and perceived stress to well-being. Participants were 381 pupils aged 12-16\u2009years (56.1% female). Hierarchical regression models and a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) were conducted. Trait emotional intelligence, self-esteem and low perceived stress were related in the expected direction to life satisfaction and somatic complaints. Findings support a specific pathway to improve wellbeing in preadolescents.", "Bird swarm algorithm is one of the swarm intelligence algorithms proposed recently. However, the original bird swarm algorithm has some drawbacks, such as easy to fall into local optimum and slow convergence speed. To overcome these short-comings, a dynamic multi-swarm differential learning quantum bird swarm algorithm which combines three hybrid strategies was established. First, establishing a dynamic multi-swarm bird swarm algorithm and the differential evolution strategy was adopted to enhance the randomness of the foraging behavior's movement, which can make the bird swarm algorithm have a stronger global exploration capability. Next, quantum behavior was introduced into the bird swarm algorithm for more efficient search solution space. Then, the improved bird swarm algorithm is used to optimize the number of decision trees and the number of predictor variables on the random forest classification model. In the experiment, the 18 benchmark functions, 30 CEC2014 functions, and the 8 UCI datasets are tested to show that the improved algorithm and model are very competitive and outperform the other algorithms and models. Finally, the effective random forest classification model was applied to actual oil logging prediction. As the experimental results show, the three strategies can significantly boost the performance of the bird swarm algorithm and the proposed learning scheme can guarantee a more stable random forest classification model with higher accuracy and efficiency compared to others.", "Artificial intelligence algorithms based on principles of deep learning (DL) have made a large impact on the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of MRI data. Despite the large number of retrospective studies using DL, there are fewer applications of DL in the clinic on a routine basis. To address this large translational gap, we review the recent publications to determine three major use cases that DL can have in MRI, namely, that of model-free image synthesis, model-based image reconstruction, and image or pixel-level classification. For each of these three areas, we provide a framework for important considerations that consist of appropriate model training paradigms, evaluation of model robustness, downstream clinical utility, opportunities for future advances, as well recommendations for best current practices. We draw inspiration for this framework from advances in computer vision in natural imaging as well as additional healthcare fields. We further emphasize the need for reproducibility of research studies through the sharing of datasets and software. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2.", "Chemists have to a large extent gained their knowledge by doing experiments and thus gather data. By putting various data together and then analyzing them, chemists have fostered their understanding of chemistry. Since the 1960s, computer methods have been developed to perform this process from data to information to knowledge. Simultaneously, methods were developed for assisting chemists in solving their fundamental questions such as the prediction of chemical, physical, or biological properties, the design of organic syntheses, and the elucidation of the structure of molecules. This eventually led to a discipline of its own: chemoinformatics. Chemoinformatics has found important applications in the fields of drug discovery, analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, agrichemical research, food science, regulatory science, material science, and process control. From its inception, chemoinformatics has utilized methods from artificial intelligence, an approach that has recently gained more momentum.", "Despite the proximity and interconnections between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (oPt), great disparities persist in health status between these two regions. This disparity is seen in infant, child and maternal mortality, life expectancy, mortality rates for leading causes of death and measures of mental well-being. This paper compares health indicators between oPt and Israel and examines the social determinants of health that may be responsible for differences between them. Data on health indicators were obtained from publicly available publications or websites of the World Health Organization and The World Bank, as well as the database of the Global Burden of Disease Project of the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. Data on the social determinants of health were obtained from publications and websites of the United Nations, the World Bank, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Palestinian and Israeli government reports, reports from non-governmental organisations, peer-reviewed studies and news articles. The health disparities are due to a complex mix of factors involving economic conditions, food insecurity, environmental exposures, psychological trauma and stress, and access to health services, most of which can be related directly or indirectly to the Israeli military occupation of oPt.", "Study of the permeability of small organic molecules across lipid membranes plays a significant role in designing potential drugs in the field of drug discovery. Approaches to design promising drug molecules have gone through many stages, from experiment-based trail-and-error approaches, to the well-established avenue of the quantitative structure-activity relationship, and currently to the stage guided by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence techniques. In this work, we present a study of the permeability of small drug-like molecules across lipid membranes by two types of ML models, namely the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and deep neural network (DNN) models. Molecular descriptors and fingerprints are used for featurization of organic molecules. Using molecular descriptors, the LASSO model uncovers that the electro-topological, electrostatic, polarizability, and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity properties are the most important physical properties to determine the membrane permeability of small drug-like molecules. Additionally, with molecular fingerprints, the LASSO model suggests that certain chemical substructures can significantly affect the permeability of organic molecules, which closely connects to the identified main physical properties. Moreover, the DNN model using molecular fingerprints can help develop a more accurate mapping between molecular structures and their membrane permeability than LASSO models. Our results provide deep understanding of drug-membrane interactions and useful guidance for the inverse molecular design of drug-like molecules. Last but not least, while the current focus is on the permeability of drug-like molecules, the methodology of this work is general and can be applied for other complex physical chemistry problems to gain molecular insights.", "The purpose of this study was to examine the nature of phonological processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as it pertains to their nonverbal cognitive and linguistic abilities.\nTwenty-one participants between the ages of 9 and 21 years were administered a nonverbal cognitive assessment (Raven test), a language measure that requires receptive and expressive knowledge of semantics, syntax and morphology, as well as the integration across these language domains (CELF-4), and a measure of phonological processing (CTOPP).\nResults show that performance on nonword repetition (NWR) that reflects an aspect of phonological memory was significantly low, whereas performance on phoneme reversal, phoneme elision, blending words and memory for digits was within the normal range. Hierarchical regressions with age, nonverbal intelligence (Raven test) and receptive language (CELF) as predictors showed that for NWR and phoneme elision the receptive part of the CELF was the main significant -predictor, after controlling for age. For phoneme reversal and memory for digits, however, the Raven score was the significant predictor, suggesting that cognitive nonverbal ability is the main factor explaining variability in these tasks.\nA deficit in phonological memory characterizes individuals in the autistic population. This deficit may influence language acquisition in this population consistent with other populations of children with language impairments. Other tasks of phonological awareness, however, might be preserved especially when they do not involve memory for long phonological sequences and when the cognitive abilities are within the norm.", "Direct PCR can be used to successfully generate full STR profiles from DNA present on the surface of objects. STR profiles are only of use in cases where a potential donor profile is available for comparison, and DNA is of sufficient DNA quality and quantity to generate a reliable profile. Often, no donor information is available and only trace DNA is present on items. As a result, alternative techniques are required to generate genetic data that can provide investigative leads. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) offers the ability to detect trace levels of DNA and improve DNA analysis success from touched items. Here, we present the first application of direct PCR coupled with MPS to generate forensic intelligence SNP data from latent DNA. The panels assessed are (1) the HIrisplex System that targets 24 SNPs to simultaneously predict hair and eye, and (2) the Precision ID Ancestry Panel that targets 165 autosomal SNPs indicative of biogeographic ancestry. For each panel, we analysed 60 touched samples across five individuals and four substrates (glass slide, fuse, zip-lock bag and wire) using Ion AmpliSeq Library Preparation Kit on the automated Ion Chef System and Ion Torrent PGM. We examine the SNP recovery, concordance with reference samples and the genotype reproducibility from different substrates and donors. The results demonstrate the application of this approach for obtaining informative genetic from trace amounts of DNA.", "Advances in artificial intelligence research allow us to build fairly sophisticated agents: robots and computer programs capable of acting and deciding on their own (in some sense). These systems raise questions about who is responsible when something goes wrong-when such systems harm or kill humans. In a recent paper, Sven Nyholm has suggested that, because current AI will likely possess what we might call \"supervised agency\", the theory of responsibility for individual agency is the wrong place to look for an answer to the question of responsibility. Instead, or so argues Nyholm, because supervised agency is a form of collaborative agency-of acting together-the right place to look is the theory of collaborative responsibility-responsibility in cases of acting together. This paper concedes that current AI will possess supervised agency, but argues that it is nevertheless wrong to think of the relevant human-AI interactions as a form of collaborative agency and, hence, that responsibility in cases of collaborative agency is not the right place to look for the responsibility-grounding relation in human-AI interactions. It also suggests that the right place to look for this responsibility-grounding relation in human-AI interactions is the use of certain sorts of agents as instruments.", "Clinical trials are a fundamental tool used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new drugs and medical devices and other health system interventions. The traditional clinical trials system acts as a quality funnel for the development and implementation of new drugs, devices and health system interventions. The concept of a \"digital clinical trial\" involves leveraging digital technology to improve participant access, engagement, trial-related measurements, and/or interventions, enable concealed randomized intervention allocation, and has the potential to transform clinical trials and to lower their cost. In April 2019, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) held a workshop bringing together experts in clinical trials, digital technology, and digital analytics to discuss strategies to implement the use of digital technologies in clinical trials while considering potential challenges. This position paper builds on this workshop to describe the current state of the art for digital clinical trials including (1) defining and outlining the composition and elements of digital trials; (2) describing recruitment and retention using digital technology; (3) outlining data collection elements including mobile health, wearable technologies, application programming interfaces (APIs), digital transmission of data, and consideration of regulatory oversight and guidance for data security, privacy, and remotely provided informed consent; (4) elucidating digital analytics and data science approaches leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms; and (5) setting future priorities and strategies that should be addressed to successfully harness digital methods and the myriad benefits of such technologies for clinical research.", "This study aimed to assess the effects of folic acid (FA) combined with a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intervention on the cognitive function and inflammatory cytokines in elderly subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial recruited 240 individuals with MCI in Tianjin, China, and randomly allocated into 4 groups: FA\u2009+\u2009DHA (FA 800\u00a0\u03bcg/d\u2009+\u2009DHA 800\u00a0mg/d), FA (FA 800\u00a0\u03bcg/d), DHA (DHA 800\u00a0mg/d), and placebo. Cognitive function, serum folate and homocysteine\u00a0(Hcy), plasma DHA and inflammatory cytokines levels were measured at baseline and 6\u00a0months.\nDaily oral FA, DHA and their combined use for 6\u00a0months significantly improved the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) and some subtests of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale compared to the placebo. The increases of FSIQ, arithmetic, picture completion scores in the FA group and picture completion, block design scores in the DHA group were significantly less than that in the FA combined DHA group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Meanwhile, daily oral FA, DHA and their combined use for 6\u00a0months significantly decreased plasma inflammatory cytokines compared to the placebo. The changes of interleukin-1\u03b2 levels in the FA group and interleukin-6 levels in the DHA group were significantly less than that in the FA\u2009+\u2009DHA group (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nDaily oral FA, DHA and their combined use for 6\u00a0months can significantly improve cognitive function and decrease plasma inflammatory cytokines in MCI individuals. The combination of FA and DHA was more beneficial than each individual nutrient on their own.", "Can a deep machine learning artificial intelligence algorithm predict ploidy and implantation in a known data set of static blastocyst images, and how does its performance compare against chance and experienced embryologists?\nA database of blastocyst images with known outcome was applied with an algorithm dubbed ERICA (Embryo Ranking Intelligent Classification Algorithm). It was evaluated against its ability to predict euploidy, compare ploidy prediction against randomly assigned prognosis labels and against senior embryologists, and if it could rank an euploid embryo highly.\nA total of 1231 embryo images were classed as good prognosis if euploid and implanted or poor prognosis if aneuploid and failed to implant. An accuracy of 0.70 was obtained with ERICA, with positive predictive value of 0.79 for predicting euploidy. ERICA had greater normalized discontinued cumulative gain (ranking metric) than random selection (P\u202f=\u202f0.0007), and both embryologists (P\u202f=\u202f0.0014 and 0.0242, respectively). ERICA ranked an euploid blastocyst first in 78.9% and at least one euploid embryo within the top two blastocysts in 94.7% of cases, better than random classification and the two senior embryologists. Average embryo ranking time for four blastocysts was under 25 s.\nArtificial intelligence lends itself well to image pattern recognition. We have trained ERICA to rank embryos based on ploidy and implantation potential using single static embryo image. This tool represents a potentially significant advantage to assist embryologists to choose the best embryo, saving time spent annotating and does not require time lapse or invasive biopsy. Future work should be directed to evaluate reproducibility in different data sets.", "Early judgment of the depth of burns is very important for the accurate formulation of treatment plans. In medical imaging the application of Artificial Intelligence has the potential for serving as a very experienced assistant to improve early clinical diagnosis. Due to lack of large volume of a particular feature, there has been almost no progress in burn field.\n484 early wound images are collected on patients who discharged home after a burn injury in 48\u2009h, from five different levels of hospitals in Hunan Province China. According to actual healing time, all images are manually annotated by five professional burn surgeons and divided into three sets which are shallow(0-10 days), moderate(11-20 days) and deep(more than 21 days or skin graft healing). These ROIs were further divided into 5637 patches sizes 224\u2009\u00d7\u2009224 pixels, of which 1733 shallow, 1804 moderate, and 2100 deep. We used transfer learning suing a Pre-trained ResNet50 model and the ratio of all images is 7:1.5:1.5 for training:validation:test.\nA novel artificial burn depth recognition model based on convolutional neural network was established and the diagnostic accuracy of the three types of burns is about 80%.\nThe actual healing time can be used to deduce the depth of burn involvement. The artificial burn depth recognition model can accurately infer healing time and burn depth of the patient, which is expected to be used for auxiliary diagnosis improvement.", "Malignant melanoma is the skin tumor that causes most deaths in Germany. At an early stage, melanoma is well treatable, so early detection is essential. However, the skin cancer screening program in Germany has been criticized because although melanomas have been diagnosed more frequently since introduction of the program, the mortality from malignant melanoma has not decreased. This indicates that the observed increase in melanoma diagnoses be due to overdiagnosis, i.e. to the detection of lesions that would never have created serious health problems for the patients. One of the reasons is the challenging distinction between some benign and malignant lesions. In addition, there may be lesions that are biologically equivocal, and other lesions that are classified as malignant according to current criteria, but that grow so slowly that they would never have posed a threat to patient's life. So far, these \"indolent\" melanomas cannot be identified reliably due to a lack of biomarkers. Moreover, the likelihood that an in-situ melanoma will progress to an invasive tumor still cannot be determined with any certainty. When benign lesions are diagnosed as melanoma, the consequences are unnecessary psychological and physical stress for the affected patients and incurred therapy costs. Vice versa, underdiagnoses in the sense of overlooked melanomas can adversely affect patients' prognoses and may necessitate more intense therapies. Novel diagnostic options could reduce the number of over- and underdiagnoses and contribute to more objective diagnoses in borderline cases. One strategy that has yielded promising results in pilot studies is the use of artificial intelligence-based diagnostic tools. However, these applications still await translation into clinical and pathological routine.", "Children exposed to early adversity are vulnerable to cognitive impairments and externalizing behaviors. Attending childcare may, however, partly buffer this detrimental effect by providing social and cognitive stimulation in a secure environment. The aims of this study were (a) to determine whether the association between exposure to adversity and later externalizing behaviors is mediated by children's cognitive abilities, and (b) to examine if childcare attendance moderates this mediation-thereby highlighting a protective function of children's childcare attendance.\nData come from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents (N\u00a0=\u00a06,149). Exposure to adversity was assessed by maternal reports three times from the second trimester of the mother's pregnancy to the child's fourth year of age. Childcare attendance was assessed on four occasions between eight months and three years of age. Factors explaining differences in childcare attendance were controlled using propensity score weights. Children's cognitive abilities were assessed by the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children at eight years of age, and externalizing behaviors were reported by mothers using the Development and Well-Being Assessment interview at 10, 13, and 15\u00a0years of age.\nNotably, lower cognitive abilities partly accounted for the higher levels of externalizing behaviors in adolescents exposed to adversity (B indirect effect\u00a0=\u00a00.02, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.007-0.03, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Importantly, childcare attendance moderated this indirect effect. For children exposed to adversity, being in maternal care was associated with lower cognitive abilities which were related to higher levels of externalizing behaviors. On the contrary, for children exposed to adversity, attending childcare was associated with higher cognitive abilities which were linked to lower levels of externalizing behaviors.\nEasily accessible community childcare may be a relatively low-cost public health strategy to prevent the emergence of externalizing behavioral problems in adolescence through its positive effects on cognitive abilities.", "The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) has revolutionized our daily lives and will soon be instrumental in healthcare delivery. The rise of ML is due to multiple factors: increasing access to massive datasets, exponential increases in processing power, and key algorithmic developments that allow ML models to tackle increasingly challenging questions. Progressively more transplantation research is exploring the potential utility of ML models throughout the patient journey, although this has not yet widely transitioned into the clinical domain. In this review, we explore common approaches used in ML in solid organ clinical transplantation and consider opportunities for ML to help clinicians and patients. We discuss ways in which ML can aid leverage of large complex datasets, generate cutting-edge prediction models, perform clinical image analysis, discover novel markers in molecular data, and fuse datasets to generate novel insights in modern transplantation practice. We focus on key areas in transplantation in which ML is driving progress, explore the future potential roles of ML, and discuss the challenges and limitations of these powerful tools.", "Artificial visual system with information sensing, processing, and memory function is promoting the development of artificial intelligence techniques. Photonic synapse as an essential component can enhance the visual information processing efficiency owing to the high propagation speed, low latency, and large bandwidth. Herein, photonic synaptic transistors based on organic semiconductor poly[2,5-(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-5,5-(2,5-di(thien-2-yl)thieno [3,2-b]thiophene)] (DPPDTT) and perovskite CsPbBr3 quantum dots are fabricated by a simple solution process. The device can simulate fundamental synaptic behaviors, including excitatory postsynaptic current, pair-pulse facilitation, the transition of short-term memory to long-term memory, and \"learning experience\" behavior. Combining the advantages of the high photosensitivity of perovskites and relatively high conductivity of DPPDTT, the device can exhibit excellent synaptic performances at a low voltage of -0.2 V. Even under an ultralow operation voltage of -0.0005 V, the device can still show obvious synaptic responses. Tunable synaptic integration behaviors including \"AND\" and \"OR\" light logic functions can be realized. An artificial visual system is successfully emulated by illuminating the synaptic arrays employing light of different densities. Therefore, low-voltage synaptic devices based on organic semiconductor and CsPbBr3 quantum dots with a simple fabrication technique present high potential to mimic human visual memory.", "Deep learning-based artificial intelligence models are widely used in various computing fields. Especially, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models perform very well for image recognition and classification. In this paper, we propose an optimized CNN-based recognition model to recognize Caoshu characters. In the proposed scheme, an image pre-processing and data augmentation techniques for our Caoshu dataset were applied to optimize and enhance the CNN-based Caoshu character recognition model's recognition performance. In the performance evaluation, Caoshu character recognition performance was compared and analyzed according to the proposed performance optimization. Based on the model validation results, the recognition accuracy was up to about 98.0% in the case of TOP-1. Based on the testing results of the optimized model, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are 88.12%, 81.84%, 84.20%, and 83.0%, respectively. Finally, we have designed and implemented a Caoshu recognition service as an Android application based on the optimized CNN based Cahosu recognition model. We have verified that the Caoshu recognition service could be performed in real-time.", "Colonoscopy is an important method to diagnose polyps, especially adenomatous polyps. However, the rate of missed diagnoses is relatively high. In this study, we aimed to determine whether artificial intelligence (AI) improves the polyp detection rate (PDR) and adenoma detection rate (ADR) with colonoscopy. We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases; the search included entries in the databases up to and including 29 February 2020. Five articles that involved a total of 4311 patients fulfilled the selection criteria. The results of these studies showed that both PDR and ADR increased with the assistance of AI compared with those in control groups {pooled odds ratio (OR) = 1.91 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68-2.16] and 1.75 (95% CI 1.52-2.01), respectively}. Good bowel preparation reduced the impact of AI, but significant differences were still apparent in PDR and ADR [pooled OR = 1.69 (95% CI 1.32-2.16) and 1.36 (95% CI 1.04-1.78), respectively]. The characteristics of polyps and adenomas also influenced the results. The average number of polyps and adenomas detected varied significantly by location, and small polyps and adenomas were more likely to be missed. However, the effect of the morphology of polyps and AI-assisted detection needs further studies. In conclusion, AI increases the detection rates of polyps and adenomas in colonoscopy. Without AI assistance, detection rates can be improved with better bowel preparation and training for small polyp and adenoma detection.", "Currently, social networks present information of great relevance to various government agencies and different types of companies, which need knowledge insights for their business strategies. From this point of view, an important technique for data analysis is to create and maintain an environment for collecting data and transforming them into intelligence information to enable analysts to observe the evolution of a given topic, elaborate the analysis hypothesis, identify botnets, and generate data to aid in the decision-making process. Focusing on collecting, analyzing, and supporting decision-making, this paper proposes an architecture designed to monitor and perform anonymous real-time searches in tweets to generate information allowing sentiment analysis on a given subject. Therefore, a technological structure and its implementation are defined, followed by processes for data collection and analysis. The results obtained indicate that the proposed solution provides a high capacity to collect, process, search, analyze, and view a large number of tweets in several languages, in real-time, with sentiment analysis capabilities, at a low cost of implementation and operation.", "To propose a health care model that integrates point-of-care technologies and artificial intelligence for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA theoretical model was used in which one million people accessed the mobile application CoronApp-Colombia, which collects personal data, signs, symptoms and epidemiological links compatible with COVID-19. With the information from the app artificial intelligence techniques (data science) were applied in a virtual situation room.\nUsers compatible with COVID-19 were prioritized and subjected to a rapid diagnostic test for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Screening with the rapid diagnostic test would allow detection of sero-reactive individuals, for whom diagnostic confirmation would be carried out using molecular biology (PCR). Information from positive cases confirmed by PCR would be re-screened using artificial intelligence and spatial statistical techniques to identify geographical foci of infection. These foci could be actively searched for contacts with positive index cases and the diagnostic route would be followed again using the rapid diagnostic test and PCR.\nThis model may be useful for countries in the region with weak or absent technological platforms for PCR diagnosis to maximize existing resources, estimate the epidemiological burden of COVID-19 (infection, morbidity, mortality and lethality) and implement containment, mitigation and control plans according to their needs.\nProponer un modelo de atenci\u00f3n en salud que integra tecnolog\u00edas que pueden emplearse en el lugar de atenci\u00f3n (point-of-care) y t\u00e9cnicas de inteligencia artificial.\nSe us\u00f3 un modelo te\u00f3rico en el que un mill\u00f3n de personas accedieron a la aplicaci\u00f3n m\u00f3vil CoronApp-Colombia, que recoge datos personales, signos, s\u00edntomas y nexos epidemiol\u00f3gicos compatibles con COVID-19.

In Korea, WfO is used by multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) caring for cancer patients. This study aimed to investigate the effect of WfO use on hospital satisfaction and perception among patients cared for by MDTs. This was a descriptive study that used a written survey to gather information from cancer patients at a hospital in Korea. The rate of positive change in patient perception after treatment was 86.8% in the MDT-WfO group and 71.2% in the MDT group. In terms of easily understandable explanations, the MDT-WfO (9.53 points) group reported higher satisfaction than the MDT group (9.24 points). Younger patients in the MDT-WfO group showed high levels of satisfaction and reliability of treatment. When WfO was used, the probability of positive change in patient perception of the hospital was 2.53 times higher than when WfO was not used. With a one-point increase in overall satisfaction, the probability of positive change in patient perception of the hospital increased 1.97 times. Therefore, if WfO is used appropriately in the medical field, it may enhance patient satisfaction and change patient perception positively.", "Marc Brackett and Christina Cipriano at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence trace the formation of a young field and its growing impact on education and personal development.", "As internalizing and externalizing problems often co-occur, the current study utilized a longitudinal dataset of 784 at-risk children (predominantly from low-income families and academically at-risk; 52.6% male) followed yearly from Grade 1 to Grade 12 to: (a) explore the heterogeneity in the codevelopment patterns of internalizing and externalizing problems by using a person-centered approach, and (b) investigate early childhood antecedents that might explain differentiated codevelopmental patterns. The antecedents consisted of individual (i.e., ego-resilient personality, intelligence, language ability, gender, and ethnicity) and contextual factors (i.e., maternal support and responsiveness, family socioeconomic adversity, teacher-child relationship conflict, and peer rejection). We identified 4 distinct codevelopment patterns including a chronic co-occurring group (30.1%), a moderate co-occurring group (28.5%), a pure-externalizing group (18.6%), and a low-risk group (22.8%). While children who belonged to any of the 3 higher risk groups exhibited more adverse early childhood antecedents compared with the low-risk group, the chronic co-occurring group displayed the most severe profiles of early childhood antecedents compared with the moderate co-occurring and the pure-externalizing groups. Common antecedents for the 3 higher risk groups were lower ego-resilient personality, higher teacher-child relationship conflict, being male, and being African American. Low language ability and peer rejection were identified as unique antecedents for the chronic co-occurring group.

A total of 158,444 subjects from UK Biobank were used in this study. Linear regression analyses were first conducted to assess the correlations between long-term antibiotic use during early life and mental traits. Gene-environment-wide interaction study (GEWIS) was then performed by PLINK2.0 to detect the interaction effects between long-term antibiotic use during early life and genes on the risks of mental traits. Finally, DAVID tool was used to conduct gene ontology (GO) analysis of the identified genes interacting with long-term antibiotic use during early life. We found negative associations of long-term antibiotic use during early life with remembrance (p value=1.74\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6, b\u2009=\u2009-0.10) and intelligence (p value=2.64\u2009\u00d7\u200910-26, b\u2009=\u2009-0.13), and positive associations of long-term antibiotic use during early life with anxiety (p value\u2009=\u20092.75\u2009\u00d7\u200910-47, b\u2009=\u20090.12) and depression (p value=2.01\u2009\u00d7\u200910-195, b\u2009=\u20090.25). GEWIS identified multiple significant genes-long-term antibiotic use during early life interaction effects, such as ANK3 (rs773585997, p value\u2009=\u20091.78\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8) for anxiety and STRN (rs140049205, p value\u2009=\u20091.88\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8) for depression.

Most importantly, the flexibility and 3D compliance of sensors, and the fitting state of the interface between the sensor and the object are of great significance to the sensing accuracy and reliability. The ordered or random stacking and entangling of flexible and electrically conductive fiber materials can form a highly porous and mechanically stable fiber assembly. The changes in external stress can lead to the air trapped in the fiber assembly to flow in and out rapidly and repeatedly, as well as the reversible mechanical deformation of fiber materials. Correspondingly, the contact areas between electrically conductive fibers in the fiber assembly are reversibly changed, which makes the conductive and flexible fiber assembly be an ideal candidate for piezoresistive sensing material. It can be further expected that the statistical stability of contact points between conductive fibers under the stress may significantly increase with the decrease in fiber diameters. Herein, a new method to make a flexible piezoresistive sensor with conductive and porous fiber assembly was proposed. An ultrasensitive piezoresistive material was facilely prepared by fabricating conductive poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (EVOH) nanofiber assemblies. The sensing performance of the piezoresistive sensor was optimized by regulating the nanofiber morphology, electrical conductivity, and mechanical properties. The flexible piezoresistive sensor exhibited a sensitivity of 2.79 kPa-1, a response time of 3 ms, and a recovery time of 10 ms. The sensing performance at different working frequencies was stable and durable within 4500 cycling tests. The flexible sensor showed good pressure-sensing accuracy and reliability when used on irregular surfaces and therefore was further applied in the static monitoring of large-area spatial pressure distribution and the wearable intelligent interactive device, demonstrating great application potential.", "Ischemic Moyamoya disease is one of the important causes of stroke, which leads to severe impairment in cognitive functions. This cognitive impairment occurs prior to stroke. However, the cognitive functions that are impaired and the mechanisms of these impairments have not been determined.\nWe analyzed 12 patients with Moyamoya disease and 12 controls. All participants underwent cognitive tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data was processed using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). Significantly different white matter areas were correlated with different cognitive functions.\nThere were significant differences in intelligence and subtraction between the patients and controls (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The parameters of DTI such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) have different changes in anterior thalamic radiation, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus, forceps minor, and other regions between the two groups.\nLeft UF and IFO may be the key brain regions affecting arithmetic function, while bilateral IFO has an effect on intelligence.

In addition to social impairment, individuals with ASD often have intellectual disability. Intelligence is known to influence the phenotypic presentation of ASD. Nevertheless, the relation between intelligence and social reciprocity in people with ASD remains unclear, especially in childhood. To elucidate this relation, we analyzed 56 typically developing children (35 male, 21 female, aged 60-91 months) and 46 children with ASD (35 male, 11 female, aged 60-98 months) from university and affiliated hospitals. Their cognitive function was evaluated using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. Their social cognition was assessed using the Social Responsiveness Scale. We used linear regression models to ascertain whether the associations between intelligence and social cognition of typically developing children and children with ASD are significantly different. Among the children with ASD, scores on the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children correlated significantly with social cognition, indicating that higher intelligence is associated with better social cognition. For typically developing children, however, no significant correlation was found. One explanation might be that children with ASD fully use general intelligence for successful learning in social cognition, although extensive use of intelligence might not be necessary for TD children. Alternatively, autistic impairment in social cognition can be compensated by intelligence despite a persistent deficit in social cognition. In either case, when using the SRS as a quantitative phenotype measure for ASD, the influence of intelligence must be considered.", "The International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics (IAHSI) is the Academy of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). As an international forum for peers in biomedical and health informatics, the Academy shall play an important role in exchanging knowledge, providing education and training, and producing policy documents.\nA major priority of the Academy's activities in its inaugural phase was to define its strategy and focus areas in accordance with its objectives and to prioritize the Academy's work, which can then be transferred to respective taskforces.\nThis document reflects the major outcomes of intensive discussions that occurred during 2019. It was presented at the Academy's 3rd Plenary on August 25th, 2019, in Lyon, France.\nRegardless of the 'living nature' of the strategy and focus areas document, it was concluded during the Plenary that the first version, which will be used as a base for decisions on the Academy's future activities, should be made available to a broad audience. Three out of eight 'Visions for IAHSI', presented in the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2018, were identified as central for developing, implementing, and evaluating the Academy's strategic directions: (1) advise governments and organizations on developing health and health sciences through informatics, (2) stimulate progress in biomedical and health informatics research, education, and practice, and (3) share and exchange knowledge. Taskforces shall be implemented to work in the following areas, which were considered as priority themes: (1) artificial intelligence in health: future collaboration of entities with natural and with artificial intelligence in health care, and (2) current landscape of standards for digital health.\nTaskforces are now being established. Besides specific key performance indicators, suggested for monitoring the work of theses taskforces, the strategy to monitor the progress of the Academy itself has to be measured by relevant and acceptable metrics.", "Trait emotional intelligence (EI) is the self-perception of emotional abilities. It is an important predictor of academic performance. Students' self-assessment (SSA) of knowledge gained from classroom teaching may help in the identification of deficiencies in knowledge and provide scope for further improvement. We aimed to evaluate the correlation between EI and SSA capability.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional, observational study with 56 first-year medical students recruited as a convenience sample. We used the \"Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire Short Form\" to assess Trait EI. For assessment of SSA, we asked the participants to write answers to a set of questions related to the topic of the preceding 1-h lecture and to assess their marks themselves. Three subject experts checked the answer sheets and we took the mean as the expert assessment (EA) marks. The correctness score of prediction was calculated by comparing SSA and EA marks. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated between EI scores and SSA correctness score.\nIn all sessions, the students underpredicted their marks. SSA correctness score showed a positive correlation with well-being (r=0.33; P=0.01); self-control (r=0.57; P<0.01); emotionality (r=0.51; P<0.01); sociability (r=0.51; P<0.01); and total score (r=0.64; P<0.01) of trait EI.\nUnderprediction of marks in formative assessment is common in 1st-year medical students. Students with higher levels of EI may predict their knowledge gained from classroom better than the students with lower EI. This may be a potential reason for the better academic performance of students with higher EI.", "Electronic devices that transmit, distribute, or utilize electrical energy create electromagnetic interference (EMI) that can lead to malfunctioning and degradation of electronic devices. EMI shielding materials block the unwanted electromagnetic waves from reaching the target material. EMI issues can be solved by using a new family of building blocks constituted of polymer and nanofillers. The electromagnetic absorption index of this material is calculated by measuring the \"S-parameters\". In this article, we investigated the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the EMI shielding field by developing a new system based on a multilayer perceptron neural network designed to predict the electromagnetic absorption of polycarbonate-carbon nanotubes composites films. The proposed system included 15 different multilayer perception (MLP) networks; each network was specialized to predict the absorption value of a specific category sample. The selection of appropriate networks was done automatically, using an independent block. Optimization of the hyper-parameters using hold-out validation was required to ensure the best results. To evaluate the performance of our system, we calculated the similarity error, precision accuracy, and calculation time. The results obtained over our database showed clearly that the system provided a very good result with an average accuracy of 99.7997%, with an overall average calculation time of 0.01295 s. The composite based on polycarbonate-5 wt.% carbon nanotube was found to be the ultimate absorber over microwave range according to Rozanov formalism.", "Developments in centrally managed communications (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) and service (e.g. Uber, airbnb) platforms, search engines and data aggregation (e.g. Google) as well as data analytics and artificial intelligence, have created an era of digital disruption during the last decade. Individual user profiles are produced by platform providers to make money from tracking, predicting, exploiting and influencing their users' decision preferences and behavior, while product and service providers transform their business models by targeting potential customers with more accuracy. There have been many social and economic benefits to this digital disruption, but it has also largely contributed to the digital destruction of mental model alignment and shared situational awareness through the propagation of mis-information i.e. reinforcement of dissonant mental models by recommender algorithms, bots and trusted individual platform users (influencers). To mitigate this process of digital destruction, new methods and approaches to the centralized management of these platforms are needed to build on and encourage trust in the actors that use them (and by association trust in their mental models). The global 'infodemic' resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, highlights the current problem confronting the information system discipline and the urgency of finding workable solutions.", "The study views the preventive measures undertaken by government to combat COVID 19 as stressor for individuals, and examines how individuals' personal traits including emotional intelligence and personality factors influence their coping strategies. The concept of trait EI is used in this study to understand its relationship with personality factors and their respective effects on the opted outcomes. Coping strategies in this study are categorised into task, emotion and avoidance-oriented coping. The results show that emotional intelligence is significantly related to all coping strategies whereas only certain personality factors make unique variances. When both emotional intelligence and personality are in the same equation, with the latter being controlled, the former shows incremental variance and the influence of personality factors is reduced. Detailed discussion of these findings and implications for policy makers and researchers are highlighted and conclude the paper.", "To compare vergence, artificial intelligence, and combined intraocular lens (IOL) calculation formulas using a new swept-source optical coherence tomographer (SS-OCT) and to analyze their performance based on manifest and estimated refractive outcomes of cataract surgery.\nDepartment of Ophthalmology, University of P\u00e9cs Medical School, P\u00e9cs, Hungary.\nRetrospective data analysis.\nOptical biometry readings of patients who underwent uneventful cataract removal and implantation of a monofocal acrylic IOL were used to predict IOL power with Barrett Universal II (BUII), Haigis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, Radial Basis Function (RBF) 2.0, Kane, Ladas Super Formula, and SRK/T. All the implanted IOLs were calculated by using the Haigis formula. The arithmetic prediction error and median and mean absolute refractive errors for all formulas were computed. The percentage of eyes within \u00b10.25 diopters (D), \u00b10.50 D, and \u00b11.0 D of prediction error was calculated.\nA total of 95 eyes of 95 patients with a mean age of 68.80 \u00b1 7.57 years were included. There was a statistically significant difference in absolute prediction error across the 8 IOL calculation formulas (P < .0001). Haigis showed the lowest mean absolute error, and it differed significantly from the BUII, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, Ladas, RBF 2.0, and SRK/T formulas (P < .05). In terms of eyes within \u00b10.25 D, \u00b10.50 D, and \u00b11.0 D of prediction error, the Haigis formula showed the overall best performance.\nThe results indicated that a recently developed SS-OCT provided accurate ocular biometry measurements before cataract surgery, and the Haigis formula incorporated in its software enabled precise calculation of IOL refractive power.", "The COVID-19 pneumonia is a global threat since it emerged in early December 2019. Driven by the desire to develop a computer-aided system for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to assist radiologists and clinicians to combat with this pandemic, we retrospectively collected 206 patients with positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 and their 416 chest computed tomography (CT) scans with abnormal findings from two hospitals, 412 non-COVID-19 pneumonia and their 412 chest CT scans with clear sign of pneumonia are also retrospectively selected from participating hospitals. Based on these CT scans, we design an artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses a multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) and evaluate its performance at both slice level and scan level. Experimental results show that the proposed AI has promising diagnostic performance in the detection of COVID-19 and differentiating it from other common pneumonia under limited number of training data, which has great potential to assist radiologists and physicians in performing a quick diagnosis and mitigate the heavy workload of them especially when the health system is overloaded. The data is publicly available for further research at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3y55vgckg6/1https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3y55vgckg6/1.", "Personalized medicine is a new paradigm of healthcare in which interventions are based on individual patient characteristics rather than on \"one-size-fits-all\" guidelines. As epidemiological datasets continue to burgeon in size and complexity, powerful methods such as statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) become necessary to interpret and develop prognostic models from underlying data. Through such analysis, machine learning can be used to facilitate personalized medicine via its precise predictions. Additionally, other AI tools, such as natural language processing and computer vision, can play an instrumental part in personalizing the care provided to patients with spine disease. In the present report, we discuss the current strides made in incorporating AI into research on spine disease, especially traumatic spinal cord injury and degenerative spine disease. We describe studies using AI to build accurate prognostic models, extract important information from medical reports via natural language processing, and evaluate functional status in a granular manner using computer vision. Through a case illustration, we have demonstrated how these breakthroughs can facilitate an increased role for more personalized medicine and, thus, change the landscape of spine care.", "The value of artificial intelligence to benefit infertile patients is a subject of debate. This paper presents the experience of one aspect of artificial intelligence, machine learning, coupled with patient empathy to improve utilization of assisted reproductive technology (ART), which is an important aspect of care that is under-recognized. Although ART provides very effective options for infertile patients to build families, patients often discontinue ART when further treatment is likely to be beneficial and most of these patients do not achieve pregnancy without medical aid. Use of ART is only in part dependent on financial considerations; stress and other factors play a major role, as shown by high discontinuation rates despite reimbursement. This commentary discusses challenges and strategies to providing personalized ART prognostics based on machine learning, and presents a case study where appropriate use of such prognostics in ART centres is associated with a trend towards increased ART utilization.", "With growing attention on the healthcare industry as a potential market for big data and artificial intelligence in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, countries around the world are introducing and developing various policies and projects related to health information technology (HIT). To assist prioritizing HIT topics in policy making, this study adopts the Delphi technique to garner expert opinions from various fields of health informatics.\nData were collected from November 2019 to February 2020 using the Delphi technique through two rounds of surveys administered via email. The Delphi panel consisted of 16 experts with a high level of experience in health informatics. They were from the Health Information Policy Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Korea, and the board of directors of the Korean Society of Medical Informatics. The experts were asked to assess the importance, urgency, and difficulty of HIT topics in three domains: technology, application, and infrastructure.\nOf the 40 topic items, a 100% agreement was reached for the importance of 6 items, including 2 items in technology, 1 item in application, and 3 items in infrastructure domains. Especially, Quadrant I of a 2\u00d72 matrix showing high importance and high urgency included 7 items in the technology domain, 2 items in the application domain, and 13 items in the infrastructure domain.\nMost items with high importance and urgency belonged to the infrastructure domain. The findings indicated that fostering an infrastructural environment should be polices with top priorities of HIT.", "General medical wards admit high-risk patients. Artificial intelligence algorithms can use big data for developing models to assess patients' risk stratification. The aim of this study was to develop a mortality prediction machine learning model using data available at the time of admission to the medical ward.\nWe included consecutive patients (ages 18-100) admitted to medical wards at a single medical center (January 1, 2013-December 31, 2018). We constructed a machine learning model using patient characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, and patients' emergency department (ED) management. The model was trained on data from the years 2013 to 2017 and validated on data from the year 2018. The area under the curve (AUC) for mortality prediction was used as an outcome metric. Youden index was used to find an optimal sensitivity-specificity cutoff point.\nOf the 118,262 patients admitted to the medical ward, 6311 died (5.3%). The single variables with the highest AUCs were medications administered in the ED (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.74), ED diagnosis (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.74), and albumin (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.73). The machine learning model yielded an AUC of 0.924 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.917-0.930). For Youden index, a sensitivity of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.89) and specificity of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.83-0.83) were observed. This corresponds to a false-positive rate of 1:5.9 and negative predictive value of 0.99.\nA machine learning model outperforms single variables predictions of in-hospital mortality at the time of admission to the medical ward. Such a decision support tool has the potential to augment clinical decision-making regarding level of care needed for admitted patients.", "We survey recent developments in medical Information Extraction (IE) as reported in the literature from the past three years. Our focus is on the fundamental methodological paradigm shift from standard Machine Learning (ML) techniques to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We describe applications of this new paradigm concentrating on two basic IE tasks, named entity recognition and relation extraction, for two selected semantic classes-diseases and drugs (or medications)-and relations between them.\nFor the time period from 2017 to early 2020, we searched for relevant publications from three major scientific communities: medicine and medical informatics, natural language processing, as well as neural networks and artificial intelligence.\nIn the past decade, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has undergone a profound methodological shift from symbolic to distributed representations based on the paradigm of Deep Learning (DL). Meanwhile, this trend is, although with some delay, also reflected in the medical NLP community. In the reporting period, overwhelming experimental evidence has been gathered, as illustrated in this survey for medical IE, that DL-based approaches outperform non-DL ones by often large margins. Still, small-sized and access-limited corpora create intrinsic problems for data-greedy DL as do special linguistic phenomena of medical sublanguages that have to be overcome by adaptive learning strategies.\nThe paradigm shift from (feature-engineered) ML to DNNs changes the fundamental methodological rules of the game for medical NLP. This change is by no means restricted to medical IE but should also deeply influence other areas of medical informatics, either NLP- or non-NLP-based.", "Neural complexity is thought to be associated with efficient information processing but the exact nature of this relation remains unclear. Here, the relationship of fluid intelligence (gf) with the resting-state EEG (rsEEG) complexity over different timescales and different electrodes was investigated. A 6-min rsEEG blocks of eyes open were analyzed. The results of 119 subjects (57 men, mean age = 22.85\u2009\u00b1\u20092.84\u2009years) were examined using multivariate multiscale sample entropy (mMSE) that quantifies changes in information richness of rsEEG in multiple data channels at fine and coarse timescales. gf factor was extracted from six intelligence tests. Partial least square regression analysis revealed that mainly predictors of the rsEEG complexity at coarse timescales in the frontoparietal network (FPN) and the temporo-parietal complexities at fine timescales were relevant to higher gf. Sex differently affected the relationship between fluid intelligence and EEG complexity at rest. In men, gf was mainly positively related to the complexity at coarse timescales in the FPN. Furthermore, at fine and coarse timescales positive relations in the parietal region were revealed. In women, positive relations with gf were mostly observed for the overall and the coarse complexity in the FPN, whereas negative associations with gf were found for the complexity at fine timescales in the parietal and centro-temporal region. These outcomes indicate that two separate time pathways (corresponding to fine and coarse timescales) used to characterize rsEEG complexity (expressed by mMSE features) are beneficial for effective information processing.", "To understand the evolution of cognitive abilities, we need to understand both how selection acts upon them and their genetic (co)variance structure. Recent work suggests that there are fitness consequences for free-living individuals with particular cognitive abilities. However, our current understanding of the heritability of these abilities is restricted to domesticated species subjected to artificial selection. We investigated genetic variance for, and genetic correlations among four cognitive abilities: inhibitory control, visual and spatial discrimination, and spatial ability, measured on >450 pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, over four generations. Pheasants were reared in captivity but bred from adults that lived in the wild and hence, were subject to selection on survival. Pheasant chicks are precocial and were reared without parents, enabling us to standardize environmental and parental care effects. We constructed a pedigree based on 15 microsatellite loci and implemented animal models to estimate heritability. We found moderate heritabilities for discrimination learning and inhibitory control (h2 = 0.17-0.23) but heritability for spatial ability was low (h2 = 0.09). Genetic correlations among-traits were largely positive but characterized by high uncertainty and were not statistically significant. Principle component analysis of the genetic correlation matrix estimate revealed a leading component that explained 69% of the variation, broadly in line with expectations under a general intelligence model of cognition. However, this pattern was not apparent in the phenotypic correlation structure which was more consistent with a modular view of animal cognition. Our findings highlight that the expression of cognitive traits is influenced by environmental factors which masks the underlying genetic structure.", "Cortical thickness (CTh) reflects cortical properties such as dendritic complexity and synaptic density, which are not only vulnerable to developmental disturbances caused by premature birth but also highly relevant for cognitive performance. We tested the hypotheses whether CTh in young adults is altered after premature birth and whether these aberrations are relevant for general cognitive abilities. We investigated CTh based on brain structural magnetic resonance imaging and surface-based morphometry in a large and prospectively collected cohort of 101 very premature-born adults (<32\u2009weeks of gestation and/or birth weight [BW] below 1,500\u2009g) and 111 full-term controls at 26\u2009years of age. Cognitive performance was assessed by full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. CTh was reduced in frontal, parietal, and temporal associative cortices predominantly in the left hemisphere in premature-born adults compared to controls. We found a significant positive association of CTh with both gestational age and BW, particularly in the left hemisphere, and a significant negative association between CTh and intensity of neonatal treatment within limited regions bilaterally. Full-scale IQ and CTh in the left hemisphere were positively correlated. Furthermore, CTh in the left hemisphere acted as a mediator on the association between premature birth and full-scale IQ. Results provide evidence that premature born adults have widespread reduced CTh that is relevant for their general cognitive performance. Data suggest lasting reductions in cortical microstructure subserving CTh after premature birth.", "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed deep gaps in our understanding of the clinical nuances of this extremely infectious viral pathogen. In order for public health, care delivery systems, clinicians, and other stakeholders to be better prepared for the next wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections, which, at this point, seems inevitable, we need to better understand this disease-not only from a clinical diagnosis and treatment perspective-but also from a forecasting, planning, and advanced preparedness point of view. To predict the onset and outcomes of a next wave, we first need to understand the pathologic mechanisms and features of COVID-19 from the point of view of the intricacies of clinical presentation, to the nuances of response to therapy. Here, we present a novel approach to model COVID-19, utilizing patient data from related diseases, combining clinical understanding with artificial intelligence modeling. Our process will serve as a methodology for analysis of the data being collected in the ASAIO database and other data sources worldwide.", "Neuroscience and neurotechnology (neuroS/T) are techniques and tools used to assess or affect the nervous system. Current and near-future developments are enabling an expanding palette of capabilities to understand and influence brain functions that can foster wellbeing and economic growth. This \"neurobioeconomy\" is rapidly growing, attributable in large part to the global dissemination of knowledge that fosters and contributes to scientific innovation, invention, and commercialization. As a result, several countries have initiated programs in brain research and innovation. Not all brain sciences engender security concerns, but a predominance in global biomedical, bioengineering, wellness/lifestyle, and defense markets enables considerable power. Such power can be leveraged in nonkinetic or kinetic domains, and several countries have identified neuroS/T as viable and of growing value for use in warfare, intelligence, and national security operations. In addition to the current focus on biotechnology, the United States and its allies must acknowledge the significance of brain science and its projected impact on the economy, national security, and lifestyles. In this article, we examine growth of the neuroS/T market, discuss how the neurobioeconomy poses distinct ethical and security issues for the broader bioeconomy, provide examples of such issues that arise from specific nation-state activity and technological commercialization, and propose a risk assessment and mitigation approach that can be engaged by the economic, scientific, and security communities.", "Structural elucidation is an important and challenging stage in the discovery of new organic molecules. Single-crystal X-ray analysis provides the most unquestionable results, though in practice the availability of suitable crystals limits its broad use. On the other hand, NMR spectroscopy has become the leading and universal technique to accomplish the task. Despite continuous advances in the field, the misinterpretation of NMR data is commonplace, evidenced by the large number of erroneous structures being published in top journals. Quantum calculations of NMR chemical shifts and scalar coupling constants emerged as ideal complements to facilitate the elucidation process when experimental NMR data is inconclusive. Since seminal reports demonstrated that affordable DFT methods provide NMR predictions accurate enough to differentiate among closely related isomers, the discipline has experienced substantial growth. The impact has been felt in different areas, and nowadays the results of such calculations are routinely seen in high impact literature.This Account describes our investigations in the field of quantum NMR calculations, focusing on the development of tools for structural elucidation and practical applications. We pioneered the use of artificial intelligence methods in the development of novel strategies of structural validation. Our first generation of trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) showed excellent ability to identify mistakes at the atom connectivity level, whereas the use of multidimensional pattern recognition pushed the performance to the stereochemical limit. In a conceptually different approach, we developed DP4+, an updated version of the DP4 probability used to determine the most likely structure among two or more candidates when one set of experimental data is available. Increasing the level of theory in NMR calculations and including unscaled data in the formalism improved the performance of the method, further validated to settle the configuration of challenging motifs such as spiroepoxides or Mosher's derivatives. One of the limitations of DP4+ is related to the relatively large computational cost involved in obtaining DFT-optimized geometries, which led to the development of a fast variant including the valuable information provided by coupling constants (J-DP4 method).These tools were explored to suggest the most probable structure of controversial natural or unnatural products originally misassigned, with some predictions further validated by synthesis (as in the case of pseudorubriflordilactone B). The possibility of predicting the structure of a natural product without requiring authentic sample was investigated in collaboration with Prof. Pilli (UNICAMP, Brazil) in the computer-guided total synthesis and stereochemical revisions of several natural products. Despite these advances, there remain considerable challenges, such as the case of configurational assessment of polar systems featuring multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions because of the poor energy predictions provided by most DFT methods. In our latest work, we tackle this problem by averaging the results provided by randomly generated ensembles, paving the way for a new paradigm in quantum NMR-assisted structural elucidation.", "Multiple factors constrain the trajectories of child cognitive development, but the drivers that differentiate the trajectories are unknown. We examine how multiple early life experiences differentiate patterns of cognitive development over the first 5 years of life in low-and middle-income settings.\nCognitive development of 835 children from the Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development (MAL-ED) multisite observational cohort study was assessed at 6, 15, 24 (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development), and 60 months (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence). Markers of socioeconomic status, infection, illness, dietary intake and status, anthropometry, and maternal factors were also assessed. Trajectories of development were determined by latent class-mixed models, and factors associated with class membership were examined by discriminant analysis.\nFive trajectory groups of cognitive development are described. The variables that best discriminated between trajectories included presence of stimulating and learning resources in the home, emotional or verbal responsivity of caregiver and the safety of the home environment (especially at 24 and 60 months), proportion of days (0-24 months) for which the child had diarrhea, acute lower respiratory infection, fever or vomiting, maternal reasoning ability, mean nutrient densities of zinc and phytate, and total energy from complementary foods (9-24 months).\nA supporting and nurturing environment was the variable most strongly differentiating the most and least preferable trajectories of cognitive development. In addition, a higher quality diet promoted cognitive development while prolonged illness was indicative of less favorable patterns of development.", "BACKGROUND The number of studies on deep learning in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis of thyroid nodules is increasing. However, it is difficult to explain what the models actually learn in artificial intelligence-assisted medical research. Our aim is to investigate the visual interpretability of the computer-assisted diagnosis of malignant and benign thyroid nodules using ultrasound images. MATERIAL AND METHODS We designed and implemented 2 experiments to test whether our proposed model learned to interpret the ultrasound features used by ultrasound experts to diagnose thyroid nodules. First, in an anteroposterior/transverse (A/T) ratio experiment, multiple models were trained by changing the A/T ratio of the original nodules, and their classification, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were tested. Second, in a visualization experiment, class activation mapping used global average pooling and a fully connected layer to visualize the neural network to show the most important features. We also examined the importance of data preprocessing. RESULTS The A/T ratio experiment showed that after changing the A/T ratio of the nodules, the accuracy of the neural network model was reduced by 9.24-30.45%, indicating that our neural network model learned the A/T ratio information of the nodules. The visual experiment results showed that the nodule margins had a strong influence on the prediction of the neural network. CONCLUSIONS This study was an active exploration of interpretability in the deep learning classification of thyroid nodules. It demonstrated the neural network-visualized model focused on irregular nodule margins and the A/T ratio to classify thyroid nodules.", "Advanced developments in diagnostic radiology have provided a rapid increase in the number of radiological investigations worldwide. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied in diagnostic radiology. The purpose of developing such applications is to clinically validate and make them feasible for the current practice of diagnostic radiology, in which there is less time for diagnosis.\nTo assess radiologists' knowledge about AI's role and establish a baseline to help in providing educational activities on AI in diagnostic radiology in Saudi Arabia.\nAn online questionnaire was designed using QuestionPro software. The study was conducted in large hospitals located in different regions in Saudi Arabia. A total of 93 participants completed the questionnaire, of which 32 (34%) were trainee radiologists from year 1 to year 4 (R1-R4) of the residency programme, 33 (36%) were radiologists and fellows, and 28 (30%) were consultants.\nThe responses to the question related to the use of AI on a daily basis illustrated that 76 (82%) of the participants were not using any AI software at all during daily interpretation of diagnostic images. Only 17 (18%) reported that they used AI software for diagnostic radiology.\nThere is a significant lack of knowledge about AI in our residency programme and radiology departments at hospitals. Due to the rapid development of AI and its application in diagnostic radiology, there is an urgent need to enhance awareness about its role in different diagnostic fields.", "Chest X-ray plays a key role in diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients and imaging features associated with clinical elements may assist with the development or validation of automated image analysis tools. We aimed to identify associations between clinical and radiographic features as well as to assess the feasibility of deep learning applied to chest X-rays in the setting of an acute COVID-19 outbreak.\nA retrospective study of X-rays, clinical, and laboratory data was performed from 48 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients (age 60\u00b117 years, 15 women) between February 22 and March 6, 2020 from a tertiary care hospital in Milan, Italy. Sixty-five chest X-rays were reviewed by two radiologists for alveolar and interstitial opacities and classified by severity on a scale from 0 to 3. Clinical factors (age, symptoms, comorbidities) were investigated for association with opacity severity and also with placement of central line or endotracheal tube. Deep learning models were then trained for two tasks: lung segmentation and opacity detection. Imaging characteristics were compared to clinical datapoints using the unpaired student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Cohen's kappa analysis was used to evaluate the concordance of deep learning to conventional radiologist interpretation.\nFifty-six percent of patients presented with alveolar opacities, 73% had interstitial opacities, and 23% had normal X-rays. The presence of alveolar or interstitial opacities was statistically correlated with age (P = 0.008) and comorbidities (P = 0.005). The extent of alveolar or interstitial opacities on baseline X-ray was significantly associated with the presence of endotracheal tube (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.049) or central line (P = 0.003 and P = 0.007). In comparison to human interpretation, the deep learning model achieved a kappa concordance of 0.51 for alveolar opacities and 0.71 for interstitial opacities.\nChest X-ray analysis in an acute COVID-19 outbreak showed that the severity of opacities was associated with advanced age, comorbidities, as well as acuity of care. Artificial intelligence tools based upon deep learning of COVID-19 chest X-rays are feasible in the acute outbreak setting.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) could automatedly detect abnormalities in digital cytological images, however, the effect in cervical cancer screening is inconclusive. We aim to evaluate the performance of AI-assisted cytology for the detection of histologically cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN) or cancer.\nWe trained a supervised deep learning algorithm based on 188,542 digital cytological images. Between Mar 13, 2017, and Oct 20, 2018, 2145 referral women from organized screening were enrolled in a multicenter, clinical-based, observational study. Cervical specimen was sampled to generate two liquid-based slides: one random slide was allocated to AI-assisted reading, and the other to manual reading conducted by skilled cytologists from senior hospital and cytology doctors from primary hospitals. HPV testing and colposcopy-directed biopsy was performed, and histological result was regarded as reference. We calculated the relative sensitivity and relative specificity of AI-assisted reading compared to manual reading for CIN2+. This trial was registered, number ChiCTR2000034131.\nIn the referral population, AI-assisted reading detected 92.6% of CIN 2 and 96.1% of CIN 3+, significantly higher than or similar to manual reading. AI-assisted reading had equivalent sensitivity (relative sensitivity 1.01, 95%CI, 0.97-1.05) and higher specificity (relative specificity 1.26, 1.20-1.32) compared to skilled cytologists; whereas higher sensitivity (1.12, 1.05-1.20) and specificity (1.36, 1.25-1.48) compared to cytology doctors. In HPV-positive women, AI-assisted reading improved specificity for CIN1 or less at no expense of reduction of sensitivity compared to manual reading.\nAI-assisted cytology may contribute to the primary cytology screening or triage. Further studies are needed in general population.", "Objective: To explore the characteristics of executive function in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder comorbid with high functioning autism. Methods: A total of 165 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD group), 65 children with attention-deficit/Hyperactivity disorder comorbid with high functioning autism (ADHD-HFA group), and 84 healthy controls (control group) (based on the criteria of DSM-5) were recruited from the Outpatient Clinic of Child Healthcare Department of Shen Zhen Children's Hospital. The Rey complex figure test (RCFT), trail making test (TMT), Stroop color-word test were used to assess working memory, shifting and inhibition. Results: ADHD group (2.1\u00b11.9, 7\u00b15, 2.1\u00b12.0 and 7\u00b15) and ADHD-HFA group (2.0\u00b12.0, 7\u00b16, 2.0\u00b12.1 and 6\u00b15) performed worse than control group (3.4\u00b12.0, 10\u00b15, 3.4\u00b12.0 and 10\u00b16) in Rey complex figure test (all P<0.05). ADHD group ((171\u00b18) s, (27.40\u00b10.82) s and (52.29\u00b11.62) s) and ADHD-HFA group ((197\u00b111) s, (29.7\u00b11.1) s and (58.6\u00b12.1) s) group took longer time on the TMT-2, Stroop2 and Stroop4 test than control group ((135\u00b118) s, (22.4\u00b11.9) s and (38.7\u00b13.8) s) (all P<0.05). In children with low intelligence quotient (IQ), ADHD group ((30\u00b18) s) and ADHD-HFA group ((34\u00b19) s) performed worse on Stroop3 test than control group ((20\u00b14) s) (all P<0.05). In children with average IQ, ADHD group ((19\u00b15) s and (24\u00b18) s) took longer time on the Stroop1 and Stroop3 test than control group ((16\u00b13) s and (19\u00b14) s) (all P<0.05). In children with high IQ, ADHD-HFA group ((20\u00b18) s) spent more time on Stroop1 than control group ((15\u00b14) s) (P<0.05). Inattention symptoms were associated with the time on TMT-2 of ADHD-HFA group (r=0.275 and 0.329, all P<0.05). The score of item 1 in autism spectrum screening questionnaire (ASSQ) was negatively correlated with immediate recall structure and detail scores as well as delay structure scores of Rey complex figure test (r=-0.358, -0.326 and -0.306, all P<0.05). The score of item 4 was positively correlated with errors of Stroop4 (r=0.296, P<0.05). The score of item 22 was positively correlated with time of color interference (r=0.279, P<0.05). Conclusions: Children with ADHD-HFA are likely to demonstrate the spatial working memory, shifting and inhibition deficits associated with ADHD alone. Some domains of executive function impairment in ADHD-HFA group are related with symptoms of inattention/hyperactivity and autism.\n\u76ee\u7684\uff1a \u63a2\u8ba8\u5171\u60a3\u9ad8\u529f\u80fd\u5b64\u72ec\u75c7\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u7f3a\u9677\u591a\u52a8\u969c\u788d\uff08ADHD\uff09\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u6267\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u7279\u5f81\u3002 \u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a \u9009\u53d62017\u5e746\u6708\u81f32019\u5e746\u6708\u5c31\u8bca\u4e8e\u6df1\u5733\u5e02\u513f\u7ae5\u533b\u9662\u513f\u7ae5\u4fdd\u5065\u79d1\u95e8\u8bca\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u7f8e\u56fd\u7cbe\u795e\u969c\u788d\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u624b\u518c\u7b2c5\u7248\uff08DSM-5\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\u6807\u51c6\u7684ADHD\u5171\u60a3\u9ad8\u529f\u80fd\u5b64\u72ec\u75c7\uff08ADHD-HFA\u7ec4\uff09\u60a3\u513f65\u4f8b\uff0c\u5355\u7eafADHD\u513f\u7ae5\uff08ADHD\u7ec4\uff09165\u4f8b\uff0c\u5065\u5eb7\u513f\u7ae5\uff08\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff0984\u540d\u3002\u91c7\u7528Rey\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u8fde\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001Stroop\u8272\u8bcd\u547d\u540d\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u8f6c\u6362\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6291\u5236\u529f\u80fd\u3002 \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a \uff081\uff09Rey\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5373\u65f6\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u5ef6\u65f6\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5ef6\u65f6\u7ec6\u8282\u5f97\u5206ADHD\u7ec4[\uff082.1\u00b11.9\uff09\u5206\u548c\uff087\u00b15\uff09\u5206\u548c\uff082.1\u00b12.0\uff09\u5206\u548c\uff087\u00b15\uff09\u5206]\u3001ADHD-HFA\u7ec4[\uff082.0\u00b12.0\uff09\u5206\u548c\uff087\u00b16\uff09\u5206\u548c\uff082.0\u00b12.1\uff09\u5206\u548c\uff086\u00b15\uff09\u5206]\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4[\uff083.4\u00b12.0\uff09\u5206\u548c\uff0810\u00b15\uff09\u5206\u548c\uff083.4\u00b12.0\uff09\u5206\u548c\uff0810\u00b16\uff09\u5206]\uff08\u5747P<0.05\uff09\uff1bADHD\u7ec4[\uff08171\u00b18\uff09 s\u548c\uff0827.40\u00b10.82\uff09 s\u548c\uff0852.29\u00b11.62\uff09 s]\u548cADHD-HFA\u7ec4[\uff08197\u00b111\uff09 s\u548c\uff0829.7\u00b11.1\uff09 s\u548c\uff0858.6\u00b12.1\uff09 s]\u7684\u6570\u5b57-\u5b57\u6bcd\u8fde\u7ebf\u65f6\u95f4\u3001Stroop2\u8bd5\u3001Stroop4\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4[\uff08135\u00b118\uff09 s\u548c\uff0822.4\u00b11.9\uff09 s\u548c\uff0838.7\u00b13.8\uff09 s]\uff08\u5747P<0.05\uff09\u3002\uff082\uff09\u5728\u4e2d\u4e0b\u667a\u5546\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0cADHD\u7ec4[\uff0830\u00b18\uff09 s]\u548cADHD-HFA\u7ec4[\uff0834\u00b19\uff09 s]\u7684Stroop3\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4[\uff0820\u00b14\uff09s]\u591a\uff08\u5747P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u4e2d\u7b49\u667a\u5546\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0cADHD\u7ec4[\uff0819\u00b15\uff09 s\u548c\uff0824\u00b18\uff09 s]\u5728Stroop1\u548cStroop3\u7528\u65f6\u591a\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4[\uff0816\u00b13\uff09 s\u548c\uff0819\u00b14\uff09 s]\uff08\u5747P<0.05\uff09\uff1b\u4e2d\u4e0a\u667a\u5546\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0cADHD-HFA\u7ec4[\uff0820\u00b18\uff09 s]\u7684Stroop1\u8017\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4[\uff0815\u00b14\uff09 s]\uff08P<0.05\uff09\u3002\uff083\uff09ADHD-HFA\u7ec4\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u4e0d\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57-\u5b57\u6bcd\u8fde\u7ebf\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08r=0.275\u30010.329\uff0c\u5747P<0.05\uff09\uff0cASSQ\u6761\u76ee1\u5f97\u5206\u4e0eRey\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u5f62\u5373\u65f6\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5373\u65f6\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u5ef6\u65f6\u7ed3\u6784\u5f97\u5206\u663e\u8457\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08r=-0.358\u3001-0.326\u3001-0.306\uff0c\u5747P<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u6761\u76ee4\u4e0eStroop4\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08r=0.296\uff0cP<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u6761\u76ee22\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u989c\u8272\u5e72\u6270\u7528\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08r=0.279\uff0cP<0.05\uff09\u3002 \u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a ADHD-HFA\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0eADHD\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u6291\u5236\u529f\u80fd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0cADHD-HFA\u7ec4\u5728\u6267\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u4e00\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u53d7\u635f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0eADHD\u75c7\u72b6\u548c\u5b64\u72ec\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\uff08ASD\uff09\u75c7\u72b6\u6709\u5173\u3002.", "The relationship between general practice (GP) registrars and their supervisors underpins the training experience for the next generation of medical practitioners. Building on recent research into the development and validation of a measure of the relationship between registrars and supervisors from the perspective of the supervisor, the current study focuses on the educational alliance from the perspective of the registrar. This paper presents an adaptation and initial validation of the clinical psychology supervisory relationship measure for GP registrars in an Australian context. Following an Expert Group review and adaptation of the items, 238 GP registrars completed the adapted tool. Using exploratory factor analysis and Procrustes confirmatory rotation, an optimal four factor model of the supervisory relationship was identified, reflecting measures of Safe base (\u03b1\u00a0=.93), Supervisor investment (\u03b1\u00a0=.96), Registrar professionalism (\u03b1\u00a0=.90), and Emotional intelligence (\u03b1\u00a0=.87). The general practice supervisory relationship measure for registrars (GP-SRMR) demonstrated excellent model fit, high internal consistency, and was theoretically consistent with the original tool. Implications for clinical education and future research are presented.", "Heart transplantation (HTx) is the most effective treatment for end-stage heart failure patients. After transplantation, patients face physiological, psychological, social, and other health care problems. Mobile health (mHealth) apps can change the delivery of conventional health care to ubiquitous care and improve health care quality. However, a dearth of mHealth apps exists for patients with HTx worldwide, including in Taiwan.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the information needed and to develop a preliminary framework for an mHealth app for post-HTx patients.\nA qualitative approach with individual in-depth interviews was conducted at a heart center in the regional hospital of northern Taiwan from June to November 2017. Patients that had undergone HTx and their health professionals were recruited for purposeful sampling. A semistructured interview guideline was used for individual interviews and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis.\nA total of 21 subjects, including 17 patients and 4 health professionals, were recruited for the study. The following five major themes were identified: reminding, querying, experience sharing, diet, and expert consulting. Minor themes included a desire to use the app with artificial intelligence and integration with professional management.\nAn intelligent mHealth app that addresses the five main themes and integrates the processes of using a mobile app could facilitate HTx self-management for Taiwanese patients.", "To build and validate artificial intelligence (AI)-based models for AMD screening and for predicting late dry and wet AMD progression within 1 and 2 years.\nThe dataset of the Age-related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) was used to train and validate our prediction model. External validation was performed on the Nutritional AMD Treatment-2 (NAT-2) study.\nAn ensemble of deep learning screening methods was trained and validated on 116,875 color fundus photos from 4139 participants in the AREDS study to classify them as no, early, intermediate, or advanced AMD and further stratified them along the AREDS 12 level severity scale. Second step: the resulting AMD scores were combined with sociodemographic clinical data and other automatically extracted imaging data by a logistic model tree machine learning technique to predict risk for progression to late AMD within 1 or 2 years, with training and validation performed on 923 AREDS participants who progressed within 2 years, 901 who progressed within 1 year, and 2840 who did not progress within 2 years. For those found at risk of progression to late AMD, we further predicted the type (dry or wet) of the progression of late AMD.\nFor identification of early/none vs. intermediate/late (i.e., referral level) AMD, we achieved 99.2% accuracy. The prediction model for a 2-year incident late AMD (any) achieved 86.36% accuracy, with 66.88% for late dry and 67.15% for late wet AMD. For the NAT-2 dataset, the 2-year late AMD prediction accuracy was 84%.\nValidated color fundus photo-based models for AMD screening and risk prediction for late AMD are now ready for clinical testing and potential telemedical deployment.\nNoninvasive, highly accurate, and fast AI methods to screen for referral level AMD and to predict late AMD progression offer significant potential improvements in our care of this prevalent blinding disease.", "Despite the common approach of bolus drug dosing using a patient's mass, a more tailored approach would be to use empirically derived pharmacokinetic models. Previously, this could only be possible though the use of computer simulation using programs which are rarely available in clinical practice. Through mathematical manipulations and approximations, a simplified set of equations is demonstrated that can identify a bolus dose required to achieve a specified target effect site concentration. The proposed solution is compared against simulations of a wide variety of pharmacokinetic models. This set of equations provides a near-identical solution to the simulation approach. A boundary condition is established to ensure the derived equations have an acceptable error. This approach may allow for more precise administration of medications with the use of point of care technology and potentially allows for pharmacokinetic dosing in artificial intelligence problems.", "Nephroblastoma is the most common kidney tumour in children. Its diagnosis is based on imagery. In the SAIAD project, we have designed a platform for optimizing the segmentation of deformed kidney and tumour with a small dataset, using Artificial Intelligence methods. These patient's structures segmented by separate tools and processes must then be fused to obtain a unique numerical 3D representation. However, when aggregating these structures into a final segmentation, conflicting pixels may appear. These conflicts can be solved by IA techniques. This paper presents a synthesis of our segmentation contribution in the SAIAD project and a new fusion method. The segmentation method uses the FCN-8s network with the OV2ASSION training method, which allows segmentation by patient and overcomes the limited dataset. This new fusion method combines the segmentations of the previously performed structures, using a simple and efficient network combined with the OV2ASSION training method as well, in order to manage eventual conflicting pixels. These segmentation and fusion methods were evaluated on pathological kidney and tumour structures of 14 patients affected by nephroblastoma, included in the final dataset of the SAIAD project. They are compared with other methods adapted from the literature. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our training method coupled with the FCN-8s network in the segmentation process with more patients, and in the case of the fusion process, its effectiveness coupled with a common network, in resolving the conflicting pixels and its ability to improve the resulting segmentations.", "Children have unique characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to perioperative adverse events. Skilled airway management is a cornerstone of high-quality anesthetic management. The use of hybrid airway techniques is a critical tool for the pediatric anesthesiologist. Point-of-care ultrasonography has an expanding role in airway management, from preoperative assessment of airway pathology and gastric contents to confirmation of tracheal intubation and identification of the cricothyroid membrane. The exciting fields of 3-dimensional printing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are areas of innovation that will transform pediatric difficult airway management in years to come.", "This study aimed to explore work ability (WA) in breast cancer (BC) survivors and to examine the mechanism by which perceived emotional intelligence (PEI) acts as a covitality factor that preserves WA and promotes the return to work in this clinical population.\nThe sample was composed of 622 women divided into two groups: BC survivors (6.75%) and healthy controls (93.25%). Participants completed the Work Ability Index and Trait-Meta-Mood Scales. Descriptive statistical and serial mediation analyses were conducted to explore the mechanism by which PEI influences the relationship between BC survivors and WA.\nPreliminary descriptive analysis showed that BC survivors displayed lower levels of WA than healthy controls. The overall serial mediation analysis revealed that BC and PEI predicted 35.4% of the variance of WA. The direct effects showed that BC and age decrease WA. Regarding PEI, our results indicated that emotional clarity and mood repair lead to higher WA, while emotional attention decreased the ability to work in both, the BC sample and healthy controls. The mediation analysis revealed that WA could be preserved in BC survivors by an indirect effect through mood repair.\nOur findings support previous research demonstrating that BC patients have lower levels of WA compared to healthy controls. This study highlighted the relevance of PEI as a covitality factor that enhances WA. Our research offers vital support for the need to improve emotional competences in BC patients to increase WA levels and return to work odds.", "Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an important diagnostic procedure performed in early breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes. Detection and examination of sentinel lymph nodes determine further therapy decisions, therefore a choice of optimal technique minimising the risk of false-negative results is of great importance. Currently, the gold standard is the dual technique comprising the blue dye and radiotracer, however, this method creates a logistical problem for many medical units. The intrinsic constraints of the existing methods led to the development of a very wide range of alternatives with varying clinical efficiency and feasibility. While each method presents with its own advantages and disadvantages, many techniques have improved enough to become a non-inferior alternative in the sentinel lymph node biopsy. Along with the improvement of the existing technologies, there are evolving trends such as multimodality of the techniques maximising the diagnostic outcome or an emerging use of artificial intelligence (AI) improving the workflow of the procedure. This literature review aims to give an overview of the current status of the standard techniques and emerging cutting-edge technologies in the sentinel lymph node biopsy.", "This article reports on a noninvasive approach in detecting and following-up individuals who are at-risk or have an existing COVID-19 infection, with a potential ability to serve as an epidemic control tool. The proposed method uses a developed breath device composed of a nanomaterial-based hybrid sensor array with multiplexed detection capabilities that can detect disease-specific biomarkers from exhaled breath, thus enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis. An exploratory clinical study with this approach was examined in Wuhan, China, during March 2020. The study cohort included 49 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 58 healthy controls, and 33 non-COVID lung infection controls. When applicable, positive COVID-19 patients were sampled twice: during the active disease and after recovery. Discriminant analysis of the obtained signals from the nanomaterial-based sensors achieved very good test discriminations between the different groups. The training and test set data exhibited respectively 94% and 76% accuracy in differentiating patients from controls as well as 90% and 95% accuracy in differentiating between patients with COVID-19 and patients with other lung infections. While further validation studies are needed, the results may serve as a base for technology that would lead to a reduction in the number of unneeded confirmatory tests and lower the burden on hospitals, while allowing individuals a screening solution that can be performed in PoC facilities. The proposed method can be considered as a platform that could be applied for any other disease infection with proper modifications to the artificial intelligence and would therefore be available to serve as a diagnostic tool in case of a new disease outbreak.", "The first case of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia was confirmed on March 3, 2020. Saudi Arabia, like many other countries worldwide, implemented lockdown of most public and private services in response to the pandemic and established population movement restrictions nationwide. With the implementation of these strict mitigation regulations, technology and digital solutions have enabled the provision of essential services.\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight how Saudi Arabia has used digital technology during the COVID-19 pandemic in the domains of public health, health care services, education, telecommunication, commerce, and risk communication.\nWe documented the use of digital technology in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic using publicly available official announcements, press briefings and releases, news clips, published data, peer-reviewed literature, and professional discussions.\nSaudi Arabia's government and private sectors combined developed and launched approximately 19 apps and platforms that serve public health functions and provide health care services. A detailed account of each is provided. Education processes continued using an established electronic learning infrastructure with a promising direction toward wider adoption in the future. Telecommunication companies exhibited smooth collaboration as well as innovative initiatives to support ongoing efforts. Risk communication activities using social media, websites, and SMS text messaging followed best practice guides.\nThe Saudi Vision 2030 framework, released in 2017, has paved the path for digital transformation. COVID-19 enabled the promotion and testing of this transition. In Saudi Arabia, the use of artificial intelligence in integrating different data sources during future outbreaks could be further explored. Also, decreasing the number of mobile apps and merging their functions could increase and facilitate their use.", "Children with overweight/obesity have poorer sleep and smaller gray matter volume (GMV) than normal-weight children. No studies have investigated the associations of objectively-assessed sleep and GMV in children with overweight/obesity, or their implications for academic and cognitive outcomes.\nTo explore the associations of sleep behaviors with GMV in the whole brain and particularly the hippocampus as a region of interest independent of sedentary time (SED) and physical activity; and to assess whether GMV in the associated regions was related to academic achievement, executive function and intelligence quotient (IQ).\nNinety-six children with overweight/obesity (10\u2009\u00b1\u20091 year) were included. Sleep behaviors were assessed with accelerometers. GMV was acquired by magnetic resonance imaging. Academic achievement, executive function and IQ were assessed with separate tests. Analyses were adjusted for sex, peak height velocity and parent education as well as SED and physical activity.\nEarlier wake time, less time in bed, wakening after sleep onset (WASO) and WASO occurrences were associated with higher GMV in eight cortical brain regions (k:56-448, P's\u2009<\u2009.001). Longer total sleep time, higher sleep efficiency and less WASO time were associated with higher GMV in the right hippocampus (\u03b2:0.187-0.220, P's\u2009<\u2009.05). The inferior temporal, fusiform, supramarginal, and postcentral gyri, the superior parietal cortex, precuneus and hippocampus associated with academic achievement and/or IQ. Associations remained after adjustments for SED and physical activity.\nSleep behaviors are associated with GMV in multiple cortical regions including the right hippocampus in children with overweight/obesity, which in turn, were associated with academic achievement and IQ.", "Quantitative assessment of proliferation can be an important endpoint in toxicologic pathology. Traditionally, cell proliferation is quantified by labor-intensive manual counting of positive and negative cells after immunohistochemical staining for proliferation markers (eg, Ki67, bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, or proliferating cell nuclear antigen). Currently, there is a lot of interest in replacing manual evaluation of histology end points with image analysis tools based on artificial intelligence. The aim of the present study was to explore if a commercially available image analysis software can be used to quantify epithelial proliferative activity in rat mammary gland and minipig oviduct. First, algorithms based on artificial intelligence were trained to detect epithelium in each tissue. Areas of BrdU- or Ki67-positive nuclei and negative nuclei were subsequently quantified with threshold analysis. Artificial intelligence-based and manually counted labelling indices were strongly correlated and equally well detected the estrous cycle influence on proliferation in mammary gland and oviduct epithelium, as well as the dramatically increased proliferation in rat mammary glands after treatment with estradiol and progesterone. In conclusion, quantification of epithelial proliferation in two reproductive tissues can be achieved in a reliable fashion using image analysis software based on artificial intelligence, thus avoiding time- and labor-intensive manual counting, requiring trained operators.", "Finite element modeling is a precious tool for the investigation of the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system. A key element for the development of anatomically accurate, state-of-the art finite element models is medical imaging. Indeed, the workflow for the generation of a finite element model includes steps which require the availability of medical images of the subject of interest: segmentation, which is the assignment of each voxel of the images to a specific material such as bone and cartilage, allowing for a three-dimensional reconstruction of the anatomy; meshing, which is the creation of the computational mesh necessary for the approximation of the equations describing the physics of the problem; assignment of the material properties to the various parts of the model, which can be estimated for example from quantitative computed tomography for the bone tissue and with other techniques (elastography, T1rho, and T2 mapping from magnetic resonance imaging) for soft tissues. This paper presents a brief overview of the techniques used for image segmentation, meshing, and assessing the mechanical properties of biological tissues, with focus on finite element models of the musculoskeletal system. Both consolidated methods and recent advances such as those based on artificial intelligence are described.", "Health care teams are increasingly forced to navigate complex challenges to achieve their collective aim of delivering high-quality, safe patient care. The teamwork literature has struggled to develop strategies that promote effective adaptive behaviours among health care teams. In part, this challenge stems from the fact that truly collective adaptive behaviour requires members of the teams to abandon the human urge to act self-sufficiently. Nature contains striking examples of collective behaviour as seen in social insects, fish and bird colonies. This collective behaviour is known as Swarm Intelligence (SI). SI remains poorly described in the health care team literature and its potential benefits hidden.\nIn this cross-cutting edge paper, I explore the principles of SI as they pertain to systemic or collective adaptation in human teams. In particular, I consider the principles of trace-based communication and collective self-healing and what they might offer to team adaptation researchers in medical education.\nFrom a SI perspective, a solution to a problem emerges as a result of the collective action of the members of the swarm, not the individual action. This collective action is achieved via four principles: direct and indirect communication, awareness, self-determination and collective self-healing. Among those principles, trace-based communication and collective self-healing have been purposefully used by other industries to foster team adaptation. Trace-based communication relies on leaving 'traces' in the environment to drive the behaviour of others. Collective self-healing is the ability of the swarm to cope with failure and adapt to changes by permitting swarm members to be interchangeable.\nWhile allowing teams to rely on indirect communication and to be interchangeable might create discomfort to our ways of thinking, teams outside health care are demonstrating their value to advance human teamwork. SI offers a helpful analogy and a constructive language for thinking about team adaptation.", "Followership is associated with many negative characteristics such as being passive, having a lower status, possessing less intelligence, receiving lower pay, order-taking, providing less value, or avoiding risk. And yet, leadership, followership, and context combine to form a coherent whole. We need to start by understanding followers in the same depth as our understanding of leaders. This chapter addresses why we should care about followers and followership and how it can be explained to others.", "In the medical field, various studies using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been attempted. Numerous attempts have been made to diagnose and classify diseases using image data. However, different forms of fracture exist, and inaccurate results have been confirmed depending on condition at the time of imaging, which is problematic. To overcome this limitation, we present an encoder-decoder structured neural network that utilizes radiology reports as ancillary information at training. This is a type of meta-learning method used to generate sufficiently adequate features for classification. The proposed model learns representation for classification from X-ray images and radiology reports simultaneously. When using a dataset of only 459 cases for algorithm training, the model achieved a favorable performance in a test dataset containing 227 cases (classification accuracy of 86.78% and classification F1 score of 0.867 for fracture or normal classification). This finding demonstrates the potential for deep learning to improve performance and accelerate application of AI in clinical practice.", "Quality is defined by the American Society for Quality (ASQ) as \"the totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bears on its ability to satisfy given needs.\" Therefore, quality is applicable to processes that supply outcomes with values that can be measured. Statistical control is an effective methodology that provides the outcome of quality of goods, bringing an added value that other methods, like quality by inspection, do not offer. The statistical methods applied to process control have been thoroughly developed, and the mathematics that supports them have been broadly demonstrated. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field in which mathematics, statistics, and programming play a joint role, and its results can also be applied to disciplines like quality control. Nevertheless, its utilization is subordinate to the qualification of the implemented algorithms. This research presents a standard procedure to AI algorithms, allowing their usage in regulated environments to ensure the quality of the delivered products or services (e.g., in drugs and medicines manufacturing). The regulated principles are defined by the concept of quality by design (QbD), which is a notion introduced in the pharmaceutical industry as a good practice for process management under multivariate analysis. This study intended to provide guidance for qualifying AI algorithms using QbD guidelines as the foundation for this purpose.", "There is a trend in healthcare for developing models for predictions of disease to enable early intervention and improve outcome.\nWe present the use of artificial intelligence algorithms that were developed by Gynisus Ltd. using mathematical algorithms.\nData were retrospectively collected on pregnant women that delivered at a single institution. Hundreds of parameters were collected and found to have different importance and correlation with the likelihood to develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We highlight 3 of 29 specific parameters that were important in pregestation and in early pregnancy, which have not been previously correlated with GDM.\nThis predictive tool identified parameters that are not currently being used as predictors in GDM, even before pregnancy. This tool opens the possibility of intervening on patients identified at risk for GDM and its complications. Future prospective studies are needed.", "Advances in the field of predictive modeling using artificial intelligence and machine learning have the potential to improve clinical care and outcomes, but only if the results of these models are presented appropriately to clinicians at the time they make decisions for individual patients. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems could be used to accomplish this. Modern CDS systems are computer-based tools designed to improve clinician decision making for individual patients. However, not all CDS systems are effective. Four principles that have been shown in other medical fields to be important for successful CDS system implementation are (1) integration into clinician workflow, (2) user-centered interface design, (3) evaluation of CDS systems and rules, and (4) standards-based development so the tools can be deployed across health systems.", "Child growth standards are commonly used to derive age- and sex-standardized anthropometric indices but are often inappropriately applied to preterm-born children (<37 weeks of gestational age (GA)) in epidemiology studies. Using the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort, we examined the impact of correcting for GA in the application of child growth standards on the magnitude and direction of associations in 2 a priori-selected exposure-outcome scenarios: infant length-for-age z score (LAZ) and mid-childhood body mass index (scenario A), and infant LAZ and mid-childhood intelligence quotient (scenario B). GA was a confounder that had a strong (scenario A) or weak (scenario B) association with the outcome. Compared with uncorrected postnatal age, using GA-corrected postnatal age attenuated the magnitude of associations, particularly in early infancy, and changed inferences for associations at birth. Although differences in the magnitude of associations were small when GA was weakly associated with the outcome, model fit was meaningfully improved using corrected postnatal age. When estimating population-averaged associations with early childhood growth in studies where preterm- and term-born children are included, incorporating heterogeneity in GA at birth in the age scale used to standardize anthropometric indices postnatally provides a useful strategy to reduce standardization errors.", "Qualitative interpretation is a good thing when it comes to reading lung images in the fight against coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), but quantitative analysis makes radiology reporting much more comprehensive. To that end, several research groups have begun looking to artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for reading and analyzing X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans, and helping to diagnose and monitor COVID-19.", "With rapid advances in experimental instruments and protocols, imaging and sequencing data are being generated at an unprecedented rate contributing significantly to the current and coming big biomedical data. Meanwhile, unprecedented advances in computational infrastructure and analysis algorithms are realizing image-based digital diagnosis not only in radiology and cardiology but also oncology and other diseases. Machine learning methods, especially deep learning techniques, are already and broadly implemented in diverse technological and industrial sectors, but their applications in healthcare are just starting. Uniquely in biomedical research, a vast potential exists to integrate genomics data with histopathological imaging data. The integration has the potential to extend the pathologist's limits and boundaries, which may create breakthroughs in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring at molecular and tissue levels. Moreover, the applications of genomics data are realizing the potential for personalized medicine, making diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and prognosis more accurate. In this chapter, we discuss machine learning methods readily available for digital pathology applications, new prospects of integrating spatial genomics data on tissues with tissue morphology, and frontier approaches to combining genomics data with pathological imaging data. We present perspectives on how artificial intelligence can be synergized with molecular genomics and imaging to make breakthroughs in biomedical and translational research for computer-aided applications.", "With the rapid growth of sensor networks and the enormous, fast-growing volumes of data collected from these sensors, there is a question relating to the way it will be used, and not only collected and analyzed. The data from these sensors are traditionally used for controlling and influencing the states and processes. Standard controllers are available and successfully implemented. However, with the data-driven era we are facing nowadays, there is an opportunity to use controllers, which can include much information, elusive for common controllers. Our goal is to propose a design of an intelligent controller-a conventional controller, but with a non-conventional method of designing its parameters using approaches of artificial intelligence combining fuzzy and genetics methods. Intelligent adaptation of parameters of the control system is performed using data from the sensors measured in the controlled process. All parts designed are based on non-conventional methods and are verified by simulations. The identification of the system's parameters is based on parameter optimization by means of its difference equation using genetic algorithms. The continuous monitoring of the quality control process and the design of the controller parameters are conducted using a fuzzy expert system of the Mamdani type, or the Takagi-Sugeno type. The concept of the intelligent control system is open and easily expandable.", "Leadership development remains an overlooked component in the plastic surgery residency curriculum. Through a mixed-methods assessment of physician perceptions, this study aims to establish the value and structure of a formal leadership course for trainees.\nQualitative interviews were conducted with plastic surgery residents to identify common themes concerning the current state of leadership training and goals for improvement. These themes then guided the design of a quantitative assessment, which surveyed faculty and residents regarding their perceived need for a curriculum, the domains that should be included, and the format of delivery.\nSix residents underwent interviews, which yielded the following themes: (1) surgical residents require a distinct set of leadership skills that warrants more intensive training and (2) leadership training should assume a more structured format. The survey achieved a 76% (29/38) response rate, with residents comprising 55% of respondents. Participants were neutral to slightly satisfied with current resident leadership and \"learning on the job\" (4.62 and 4.03 on a 7-point Likert scale, respectively). Respondents reported a moderate need for formal leadership training (2.97 on a 5-point scale). Availability was ranked as the greatest barrier to curriculum implementation. Topics considered most important included effective communication, self-awareness/emotional intelligence, and strategic thinking. Formats considered most effective included in-person lectures, small group exercises, and case studies.\nThis study presents a conceptual framework for the implementation of a leadership curriculum for plastic surgery residents that may empower the development of stronger physician leaders.", "Polypyrrole (PPy) is a good candidate material for piezoresistive pressure sensors owing to its excellent electrical conductivity and good biocompatibility. However, it remains challenging to fabricate PPy-based flexible piezoresistive pressure sensors with high sensitivity because of the intrinsic rigidity and brittleness of the film composed of dense PPy particles. Here, a rational structure, that is, 3D-conductive and elastic topological film composed of coaxial nanofiber networks, is reported to dramatically improve the sensitivity of flexible PPy-based sensors. The film is prepared through surface modification of electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers by polydopamine (PDA), in order to homogeneously deposit PPy particles on the nanofiber networks with strong interfacial adhesion (PVDF/PDA/PPy, PPP). This unique structure has a high surface area and abundant contact sites, leading to superb sensitivity against a subtle pressure. The as-developed piezoresistive pressure sensor delivers a low limit of detection (0.9 Pa), high sensitivity (139.9 kPa-1), fast response (22 ms), good cycling stability (over 10,000 cycles), and reliability, thereby showing a promising value for applications in the fields of health monitoring and artificial intelligence.", "Endoscopy is essential for disease assessment in ulcerative colitis (UC), but subjectivity threatens accuracy and precision. We aimed to pilot a fully automated video analysis system for grading endoscopic disease in UC.\nA developmental set of high-resolution UC endoscopic videos were assigned Mayo endoscopic scores (MESs) provided by 2 experienced reviewers. Video still-image stacks were annotated for image quality (informativeness) and MES. Models to predict still-image informativeness and disease severity were trained using convolutional neural networks. A template-matching grid search was used to estimate whole-video MESs provided by human reviewers using predicted still-image MES proportions. The automated whole-video MES workflow was tested using unaltered endoscopic videos from a multicenter UC clinical trial.\nThe developmental high-resolution and testing multicenter clinical trial sets contained 51 and 264 videos, respectively. The still-image informative classifier had excellent performance with a sensitivity of 0.902 and specificity of 0.870. In high-resolution videos, fully automated methods correctly predicted MESs in 78% (41 of 50, \u03ba\u00a0= 0.84) of videos. In external clinical trial videos, reviewers agreed on MESs in 82.8% (140 of 169) of videos (\u03ba\u00a0= 0.78). Automated and central reviewer scoring agreement occurred in 57.1% of videos (\u03ba\u00a0= 0.59), but improved to 69.5% (107 of 169) when accounting for reviewer disagreement. Automated MES grading of clinical trial videos (often low resolution) correctly distinguished remission (MES 0,1) versus active disease (MES 2,3) in 83.7% (221 of 264) of videos.\nThese early results support the potential for artificial intelligence to provide endoscopic disease grading in UC that approximates the scoring of experienced reviewers.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) will transform every step in the imaging value chain, including interpretive and noninterpretive components. Radiologists should familiarize themselves with AI developments to become leaders in their clinical implementation. This article explores the impact of AI through the entire imaging cycle of musculoskeletal radiology, from the placement of the requisition to the generation of the report, with an added Canadian perspective. Noninterpretive tasks which may be assisted by AI include the ordering of appropriate imaging tests, automatic exam protocoling, optimized scheduling, shorter magnetic resonance imaging acquisition time, computed tomography imaging with reduced artifact and radiation dose, and new methods of generation and utilization of radiology reports. Applications of AI for image interpretation consist of the determination of bone age, body composition measurements, screening for osteoporosis, identification of fractures, evaluation of segmental spine pathology, detection and temporal monitoring of osseous metastases, diagnosis of primary bone and soft tissue tumors, and grading of osteoarthritis.", "Exposure to green space has beneficial effects on several cognitive and behavioral aspects. However, to our knowledge, no study addressed intelligence as outcome. We investigated whether the level of urbanicity can modify the association of residential green space with intelligence and behavior in children.\nThis study includes 620 children and is part of the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey (EFPTS), a registry of multiple births in the province of East Flanders, Belgium. Intelligence was assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) in 620 children (310 twin pairs) between 7 and 15 years old. From a subset of 442 children, behavior was determined based on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Prenatal and childhood residential addresses were geocoded and used to assign green space indicators. Mixed modeling was performed to investigate green space in association with intelligence and behavior while adjusting for potential confounding factors including sex, age, parental education, neighborhood household income, year of assessment, and zygosity and chorionicity. We found that residential green space in association with both intelligence and behavior in children was modified by the degree of urbanicity (p < 0.001). In children living in an urban environment, multivariable adjusted mixed modeling analysis revealed that an IQR increment of residential green space (3,000-m radius) was associated with a 2.6 points (95% CI 1.4-3.9; p < 0.001) higher total intelligence quotient (IQ) and 2.0 points (95% CI -3.5 to -0.4; p = 0.017) lower externalizing behavioral score. In children residing in a rural or suburban environment, no association was found. A limitation of this study is that no information was available on school location and the potential for unmeasured confounding (e.g., time spend outdoors).\nOur results indicate that residential green space may be beneficial for the intellectual and the behavioral development of children living in urban areas. These findings are relevant for policy makers and urban planners to create an optimal environment for children to develop their full potential.", "This study is aimed to promote China's support for innovation and entrepreneurship in the context of the rapid development of the artificial intelligence industry. Considering the advance law-based governance implemented in this country, the relationship between the psychological understanding and behavior choice of entrepreneurs in the law industry and artificial intelligence industry was explored. The investigation was conducted in the form of questionnaire survey, and the data were collected by sending emails. In addition, the model was established to make the investigation direction clearer. The reliability analysis of the questionnaire was carried out by means of Cronbach \u03b1 reliability coefficient. The validity analysis of the questionnaire was carried out by Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) coefficient. The statistical software was used to analyze the correlation between the factors in the investigation. The results show that there is a positive correlation between behavior speed in the psychological understanding of entrepreneurs in the legal industry as well as the entrepreneurial experience and entrepreneur behavior. The concentration of entrepreneurs' behavior is negatively correlated with the entrepreneur's industrial experience. The behavior speed and concentration of entrepreneurs in the artificial intelligence industry are negatively correlated with the age of entrepreneurs, but their entrepreneurial behavior and psychological understanding do not show correlation. The behavior speed and concentration of entrepreneurs in the artificial intelligence industry are positively correlated with product innovation, technological innovation, and market innovation. Therefore, the behavior choice of entrepreneurs in the legal industry are highly correlated with psychological understanding. The entrepreneurs' psychological understanding and behavior choice in the field of artificial intelligence do not show a direct correlation but indirect correlation through indirect factor innovation opportunities. The investigation on entrepreneurs' psychological understanding and behavior choice can provide important theoretical support for entrepreneurs in China's legal industry and artificial intelligence industry.", "In this paper we propose the idea that Artificial intelligence (AI) is ushering in a new era of \"Earlier Medicine,\" which is a predictive approach for disease prevention based on AI modeling and big data. The flourishing health care technological landscape is showing great potential-from diagnosis and prescription automation to the early detection of disease through efficient and cost-effective patient data screening tools that benefit from the predictive capabilities of AI. Monitoring the trajectories of both in- and outpatients has proven to be a task AI can perform to a reliable degree. Predictions can be a significant advantage to health care if they are accurate, prompt, and can be personalized and acted upon efficiently. This is where AI plays a crucial role in \"Earlier Medicine\" implementation.", "In recent years the concept of precision medicine has become a popular topic particularly in medical oncology. Besides the identification of new molecular prognostic and predictive biomarkers and the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic drugs, imaging has started to play a central role in this new era. Terms such as \"radiomics\", \"radiogenomics\" or \"radi\u2026-omics\" are becoming increasingly common in the literature and soon they will represent an integral part of clinical practice. The use of artificial intelligence, imaging and \"-omics\" data can be used to develop models able to predict, for example, the features of the tumor immune microenvironment through imaging, and to monitor the therapeutic response beyond the standard radiological criteria. The aims of this narrative review are to provide a simplified guide for clinicians to these concepts, and to summarize the existing evidence on radiomics and \"radi\u2026-omics\" in cancer immunotherapy.", "The underpinnings of poor decision-making in schizophrenia could reflect excessively risky or inhibited behaviors. This study employed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) to compare decision-making in schizophrenia cases to that of healthy controls. Individuals with schizophrenia performed significantly differently across three trials, failing to improve their performance as shown by the control group. In the control group, cognitive ability, measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) showed that Perceptual Organization scores predicted Average Inflations per Trial, Total Balloon Pops, and Total Earnings. Although the schizophrenia cases failed to learn, group performance on the BART was not associated with cognitive ability, but regression analyses showed 41.4% of average inflations per trial were explained by Excitement, Delusions, Emotional Withdrawal, and Poor Rapport; total balloon pops were only explained by emotional withdrawal and Total Earnings were reduced by Delusions, Excitement and Poor Rapport. Only healthy participants demonstrated a relation between cognitive ability performance improvement across trials. Schizophrenia cases showed less risk-taking, and earned significantly less money overall. Identifying the determinants of poor decision-making could inform interventions and possible treatments to improve their function and perhaps be of relevance to public safety if decisions are overly risky.", "Fentanyl is an anesthetic with a high bioavailability and is the leading cause of drug overdose death in the U.S. Fentanyl and its derivatives have a low lethal dose and street drugs which contain such compounds may lead to death of the user and simultaneously pose hazards for first responders. Rapid identification methods of both known and emerging opioid fentanyl substances is crucial. In this effort, machine learning (ML) is applied in a systematic manner to identify fentanyl-related functional groups in such compounds based on their observed spectral properties. In our study, accurate infrared (IR) spectra of common organic molecules which contain functional groups that are constituents of fentanyl is determined by investigating the structure-property relationship. The average accuracy rate of correctly identifying the functional groups of interest is 92.5% on our testing data. All the IR spectra of 632 organic molecules are from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database as the training set and are assessed. Results from this work will provide Artificial Intelligence (AI) based tools and algorithms increased confidence, which serves as a basis to detect fentanyl and its derivatives.", "Many machine learning models show black box characteristics and, therefore, a lack of transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness. This strongly limits their practical application in clinical contexts. For overcoming these limitations, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has shown promising results. The current study examined the influence of different input representations on a trained model's accuracy, interpretability, as well as clinical relevancy using XAI methods. The gait of 27 healthy subjects and 20 subjects after total hip arthroplasty (THA) was recorded with an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based system. Three different input representations were used for classification. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) was used for model interpretation. The best accuracy was achieved with automatically extracted features (mean accuracy Macc = 100%), followed by features based on simple descriptive statistics (Macc = 97.38%) and waveform data (Macc = 95.88%). Globally seen, sagittal movement of the hip, knee, and pelvis as well as transversal movement of the ankle were especially important for this specific classification task. The current work shows that the type of input representation crucially determines interpretability as well as clinical relevance. A combined approach using different forms of representations seems advantageous. The results might assist physicians and therapists finding and addressing individual pathologic gait patterns.", "Dyslexia is a specific disorder in reading abilities. The aim of this study was to explore whether a short visual attentional training could improve reading capabilities in children with reading disorders by changing their oculomotor characteristics. Two groups (G1 and G2) of 25 children with reading disabilities and who are matched in IQ (intelligence quotient), sex, and age participated in the study. The allocation of a subject to a specific group (G1 = experimental group; G2 = control group) was generated in an unpredictable random sequence. The reading task was recorded twice for G1, i.e., before (T1) and after (T2) 10 min of visual attentional training. Training consisted of oculomotor tasks (saccades and pursuits movements) and searching tasks (three different exercises). For G2, the two reading tasks at T1 and T2 were done at an interval of 10 min instead. We found that at T1, oculomotor performances during reading were statistically similar for both groups of children with reading disabilities (G1 and G2). At T2, the group G1 only improved oculomotor capabilities significantly during reading; in particular, children read faster, and their fixation time was shortest. We conclude that short visual attentional training could improve the cortical mechanisms responsible for attention and reading capabilities. Further studies on a larger number of dyslexic children will be necessary in order to explore the effects of different training types on the visual attentional span given its important role on the orienting and focusing visuospatial attention and on the oculomotor performance in children with dyslexia.", "This report aims to summarize the fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and to provide a non-exhaustive overview of AI applications in dental imaging, comprising diagnostics, forensics, image processing and image reconstruction. AI has arguably become the hottest topic in radiology in recent years owing to the increased computational power available to researchers, the continuing collection of digital data, as well as the development of highly efficient algorithms for machine learning and deep learning. It is now feasible to develop highly robust AI applications that make use of the vast amount of data available to us, and that keep learning and improving over time.", "The nationwide focus on patient safety and the health of residents has increased the demand for educational tools outside the operating room. Simulation is a valuable tool for assessing and developing surgical skills in a controlled and safe environment. The use of simulation as a formal component of training has been increasing in various surgical subspecialties. In general surgery, simulation examinations such as the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery and Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery have become a prerequisite to board certification. Although formal simulation examinations in plastic surgery are not universal, there has been an increase in the use of simulation to increase resident competency in the operating room. For now, we will review the current state of simulation in craniofacial, hand, microvascular, and esthetic surgery and discuss applications for the future. We will also discuss the evolving role of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality in plastic surgery training and testing.", "The COVID-19 pandemic is presenting a disproportionate impact on minorities in terms of infection rate, hospitalizations, and mortality. Many believe artificial intelligence (AI) is a solution to guide clinical decision-making for this novel disease, resulting in the rapid dissemination of underdeveloped and potentially biased models, which may exacerbate the disparities gap. We believe there is an urgent need to enforce the systematic use of reporting standards and develop regulatory frameworks for a shared COVID-19 data source to address the challenges of bias in AI during this pandemic. There is hope that AI can help guide treatment decisions within this crisis; yet given the pervasiveness of biases, a failure to proactively develop comprehensive mitigation strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic risks exacerbating existing health disparities.", "Colposcopy is widely used to detect cervical cancers, but experienced physicians who are needed for an accurate diagnosis are lacking in developing countries. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been recently used in computer-aided diagnosis showing remarkable promise. In this study, we developed and validated deep learning models to automatically classify cervical neoplasms on colposcopic photographs. Pre-trained convolutional neural networks were fine-tuned for two grading systems: the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) system and the lower anogenital squamous terminology (LAST) system. The multi-class classification accuracies of the networks for the CIN system in the test dataset were 48.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3% by Inception-Resnet-v2 and 51.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2% by Resnet-152. The accuracies for the LAST system were 71.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8% and 74.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for discriminating high-risk lesions from low-risk lesions by Resnet-152 was 0.781\u2009\u00b1\u20090.020 for the CIN system and 0.708\u2009\u00b1\u20090.024 for the LAST system. The lesions requiring biopsy were also detected efficiently (AUC, 0.947\u2009\u00b1\u20090.030 by Resnet-152), and presented meaningfully on attention maps. These results may indicate the potential of the application of AI for automated reading of colposcopic photographs.", "Research on sex differences in the association of psychopathy with fluid intelligence is limited, and it remains unknown if fluid intelligence plays a meaningful role in explaining the psychopathy-aggression link for men and women. The present study aimed to test for sex differences in the relation between the four-facet model of psychopathy and intelligence, and to assess whether fluid intelligence moderates the link between psychopathy and aggression. In a community sample of men (n = 356) and women (n = 196), we assessed psychopathy using the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV), fluid intelligence using the Raven's Progressive Matrices, and types of aggression using the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ). Hierarchical regressions showed that the psychopathy lifestyle facet was negatively associated with intelligence and there were no sex differences. Our analyses for types of aggression revealed sex differences and similarities. For both men and women, total AQ scores were predicted by higher antisocial facet scores. Lower intelligence moderated the link between higher antisocial facet scores and aggression in men, but not for women. Physical aggression in women was associated with higher interpersonal, affective, and antisocial facet scores, whereas for men, it was only associated with higher antisocial facet scores. Verbal and indirect aggression were associated with higher intelligence in both men and women. For men only, higher antisocial facet scores were associated with verbal and indirect aggression. Higher intelligence moderated the link between the lifestyle facet and indirect aggression for women, whereas for men, it moderated the link between the affective facet and indirect aggression. This study further highlights sex differences in mechanisms of psychopathy-related aggression, which need to be considered in the development of violence interventions and risk assessment.", "Health City was established in the fall of 2018 as a Canadian not-for-profit corporation that works with numerous stakeholders to develop new pathways of care that can drive better health outcomes and economic development in the health sector. Data, artificial intelligence, and extended reality are technology platforms in healthcare that are highlighted in the context of Health City Initiatives presented here. Health City's future area of focus in addressing challenges in procurement for health innovations is also discussed as a new approach that connects the health industry to healthcare. Health City has been an active stakeholder in health innovation in Edmonton and will continue to focus on developing a global niche and owning that space through meaningful partnerships and impactful projects. This will drive improved health outcomes and economic development for the Edmonton region and Canada that can be scaled globally.", "The study aims to assess the impact of radiomics in the clinical practice of breast ultrasound, to determine which lesions are undetermined by the software, and to discuss the future of the radiologist's role.\nConsecutive analyses of 207 ultrasound masses from January 2018 to April 2019 referred for percutaneous breast biopsy. Breast masses were classified using dedicated ultrasound software (AI). The AI software automatically classified the masses on a scale of 0-100, where 100 is the most suspicious. We adopt the histology results as the gold standard. The cut-off point of malignancy by radiomics was determined, with \u00b110 % of margin error according to the Youden's index. We considered these lesions as undetermined masses. The performance of the AI software and the radiologist classification was compared using the area under roc curves (AUROC). We also discuss the impact of radiologist validation of AI results, especially in undetermined lesions.\nOf the 207 evaluated masses, 143 were benign, and 64 were malignant. The Youden's index was 0.516, including undetermined masses with a varied range of 10 % (0.464-0.567). Twenty-one (14.58 %) benign and twelve (19.05 %) malignant masses were in this range. The best accuracy performance to classify masses was the combination of the reader and AI (0.829). The most common undetermined masses in AI were fibroadenoma, followed by phyllodes tumor, steatonecrosis as benign. Whereas, low-grade, and high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma represents the malignant lesions.\nArtificial Intelligence has a reliable performance in ultrasound breast masses classification. Radiologist validation is critical to determine the final BI-RADS assessment, especially in undetermined masses to obtain the best classification performance.", "Financial literacy is linked to financial well-being and decision making. While financial literacy and numeracy skills are strongly related, the relevance of different aspects of numeracy (mental arithmetic, math achievement, and numerical reasoning) for financial literacy has not yet been examined. Data were collected from 88 cognitively healthy adults, mean age = 50\u2009years (SD = 15); mean education = 15\u2009years (SD = 2); 61% females; with 56% Caucasian, 36% Black, and 90% non-Hispanic. Financial literacy was measured with the widely used Big Three scale, and numeracy was measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, Arithmetic subtest; the Wide Range Achievement Test-IV, Math Computation subtest; and the Weller's Abbreviated Numeracy Scale (WANS). Regressions analyses were conducted with financial literacy as the outcome variable and each numeracy measure along with demographics (age, sex, and education) as the predictors. In all the models, only the numeracy measures were significant as individual predictors, with numerical reasoning holding the strongest association with financial literacy, followed by mental arithmetic and math achievement. The current study supports the existing literature that numeracy is important for financial literacy, and provides empirical evidence for the specific contributions of individual numeracy measures that clinicians may use to garner impressions about financial skills.", "To evaluate sella turcica (ST) bridging, associated anomalies, and morphology, in subjects with four different types of clefts, and compare them with non-cleft (NC) subjects.\nA total of 123 (31 NC and 92 cleft) Saudi subjects who had their lateral cephalogram (Late. Ceph.), orthopantomogram (OPG), and clinical details for ordinary diagnosis were included in the study. Among 92 cleft subjects, 29 had bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP), 41 had unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), nine had unilateral cleft lip and alveolus (UCLA), and 13 with unilateral cleft lip (UCL). ST bridging and seven parameters related to ST morphology and skeletal malocclusion were analyzed using Late. Ceph. Associated dental anomalies in ST bridging subjects were investigated using OPG. The images were investigated using artificial intelligence driven Webceph software. Multiple statistical tests were applied to see the differences between gender and among cleft vs NC subjects.\nST bridging was found to be higher in cleft subjects (22.82%). Most of the cleft subjects had severe skeletal Class III malocclusion associated with multiple types of dental anomalies (impacted canines, congenital missing, and presence of supernumerary teeth). No significant gender disparities in all seven parameters of ST morphology were found between NC and cleft groups. However, there were significant differences when compared among four different types of cleft individuals vs NC subjects.\nST bridging is more prevalent in cleft subjects along with Class III malocclusion and associated dental anomalies. ST morphometry differs significantly between cleft vs NC subjects. BCLP exhibits smaller values of all seven parameters as compared to all other groups.", "The presented paper scientifically discusses the progressive diagnostics of electrical drives in robots with sensor support. The AI (artificial intelligence) model proposed by the authors contains the technical conditions of fuzzy inference rule descriptions for the identification of a robot drive's technical condition and a source for the description of linguistic variables. The parameter of drive diagnostics for a robotized workplace that is proposed here is original and composed of the sum of vibration acceleration amplitudes ranging from a frequency of 6.3 Hz to 1250 Hz of a one-third-octave filter. Models of systems for the diagnostics of mechatronic objects in the robotized workplace are developed based on examples of CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine diagnostics and mechatronic modules based on the fuzzy inference system, concluding with a solved example of the multi-criteria optimization of diagnostic systems. Algorithms for CNC machine diagnostics are implemented and intended only for research into precisely determined procedures for monitoring the lifetime of the mentioned mechatronic systems. Sensors for measuring the diagnostic parameters of CNC machines according to precisely determined measuring chains, together with schemes of hardware diagnostics for mechatronic systems are proposed.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to increase quality and efficiency of breast cancer screening. Recent studies have provided comparative data on AI versus human performance in cancer detection with encouraging results, and commercially available AI systems are used worldwide as a clinical tool for mammography screening. There are, however, a number of methodological concerns in relation to the evaluation of AI systems. This review discusses these aspects as well as the opportunities and challenges of clinical validation and implementation in breast cancer screening practice.", "Significant progress has been achieved in recent years in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for medical decision support. However, many AI-based systems often only provide a final prediction to the doctor without an explanation of its underlying decision-making process. In scenarios concerning deadly diseases, such as breast cancer, a doctor adopting an auxiliary prediction is taking big risks, as a bad decision can have very harmful consequences for the patient. We propose an auxiliary decision support system that combines ensemble learning with case-based reasoning to help doctors improve the accuracy of breast cancer recurrence prediction. The system provides a case-based interpretation of its prediction, which is easier for doctors to understand, helping them assess the reliability of the system's prediction and make their decisions accordingly. Our application and evaluation in a case study focusing on breast cancer recurrence prediction shows that the proposed system not only provides reasonably accurate predictions but is also well-received by oncologists.", "Nurses' job satisfaction has a direct impact on the quality of their performance, especially in the emergency department, which is a showcase of care in hospitals, since, nurses' moral performance is greatly affected by moral intelligence, Adherence to ethics by nurses, underlies the social capital of the organization.\nThe present study was a cross-sectional, descriptive-correlational study. 99 nurses working in the emergency department of medical educational centers in Semnan, Iran, were selected by simple random sampling. Data were collected by questionnaires: demographic information, job satisfaction, moral intelligence and social capital of nurses. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analytical statistics in SPSS software. All P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nThe mean and standard deviation of job satisfaction, moral intelligence, and social capital scores were 51.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.03, 148.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.05, and 43.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.28, respectively. Job satisfaction did not have a significant relationship with moral intelligence and its domains, but it had a significant relationship with social capital and its domains (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002).\nDue to the significant relationship between job satisfaction and social capital, Nurses' satisfaction and attitude toward the job can be improved by creating a context for progress and self-actualization.", "It is challenging to estimate the phenotypic impact of the structural genome changes known as copy-number variations (CNVs), since there are many unique CNVs which are nonrecurrent, and most are too rare to be studied individually. In recent work, we found that CNV-aggregated genomic annotations, that is, specifically the intolerance to mutation as measured by the pLI score (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant), can be strong predictors of intellectual quotient (IQ) loss. However, this aggregation method only estimates the individual CNV effects indirectly. Here, we propose the use of hierarchical Bayesian models to directly estimate individual effects of rare CNVs on measures of intelligence. Annotation information on the impact of major mutations in genomic regions is extracted from genomic databases and used to define prior information for the approach we call HBIQ. We applied HBIQ to the analysis of CNV deletions and duplications from three datasets and identified several genomic regions containing CNVs demonstrating significant deleterious effects on IQ, some of which validate previously known associations. We also show that several CNVs were identified as deleterious by HBIQ even if they have a zero pLI score, and the converse is also true. Furthermore, we show that our new model yields higher out-of-sample concordance (78%) for predicting the consequences of carrying known recurrent CNVs compared with our previous approach.", "The families' data damaged by the earthquake and flood in villages and towns along Fujiang River in Sichuan are collected by using intelligences Internet of, and the process and the degree of ruined the production and life of the farmers in this area are evaluated through the information diffusion technology. The villages and towns had suffered a large loss of integrated risk from floods and earthquakes, with an average annual loss of 5.758 million Yuan. Through the comprehensive suppression and blocking intervention combined with the village watershed management and post-disaster reconstruction, the frequency and the degree of disaster occurrence have gradually decreased in the past decades, and the resilience of infrastructure such as regional rivers and diversion canals to resist integrated disasters have been enhanced and the effect of this design scheme of comprehensive disaster prevention and controlling is remarkable.", "Interview-based schizophrenia (SCZ) diagnostic methods are not completely valid. Moreover, SCZ-the disease entity is very heterogeneous. Supervised-Machine-Learning (sML) application of Artificial-Intelligence holds a tremendous promise in solving these issues.\nTo sML-based discriminating validity of resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) quantitative features in classifying SCZ from healthy and, positive (PS) and negative symptom (NS) subgroups, using a high-density recording.\nData collected at a tertiary care mental-health institute using a cross-sectional study design and analyzed at a premier Engineering Institute.\nData of 38-SCZ patients and 20-healthy controls were retrieved. The positive-negative subgroup classification was done using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale operational-criteria. EEG was recorded using 256-channel high-density equipment. Eight priori regions-of-interest were selected. Six-level wavelet decomposition and Kernel-Support Vector Machine (SVM) method were used for feature extraction and data classification.\nMann-Whitney test was used for comparison of machine learning-features. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operating characteristics-curve were measured as discriminatory indices of classifications.\nAccuracy of classifying SCZ from healthy and PS from NS SCZ, were 78.95% and 89.29%, respectively. While beta and gamma frequency related features most accurately classified SCZ from healthy controls, delta and theta frequency related features most accurately classified positive from negative SCZ. Inferior frontal gyrus features most accurately contributed to both the classificatory instances.\nSVM-based classification and sub-classification of SCZ using EEG data is optimal and might help in improving the \"validity\" and reducing the \"heterogeneity\" in the diagnosis of SCZ. These results might only be generalized to acute and moderately ill male SCZ patients.", "Artificial intelligence in healthcare increasingly relies on relations in knowledge graphs for algorithm development. However, many important relations are not well covered in existing knowledge graphs. We aim to develop a novel long-distance relation extraction algorithm that leverages the article section structure and is trained with bootstrapped noisy data to identify important relations for diagnosis, including may cause, may be caused by, and differential diagnosis.\nKnown relations were extracted from semistructured web pages and a relational database and were paired with sentences containing corresponding medical concepts to form training data. The sentence form was extended to allow one concept to be in the title. An attention mechanism was applied to reduce the effect of noisily labeled sentences. Section structure embedding was added to provide additional context for relation expressions. Graph information was further incorporated into the model to differentiate the target relations whose expressions were often similar and interwoven.\nThe extended sentence form allowed 1.75 times as many relations and 2.17 times as many sentences to be found compared to the conventional form. The various components of the proposed model all added to the accuracy. Overall, the positive sample accuracy of the proposed model was 9 percentage points higher than baseline deep learning models and 13 percentage points higher than na\u00efve Bayes and support vector machines.\nOur bootstrap data preparation method and the extended sentence form could form a large training dataset to enable algorithm development and data mining efforts. Section structure embedding and graph information significantly increased prediction accuracy.", "Training the modern ophthalmic surgeon is a challenging process. Microsurgical education can benefit from innovative methods to practice surgery in low-risk simulations, assess and refine skills in the operating room through video content analytics, and learn at a distance from experienced surgeons. Developments in emerging technologies may allow us to pursue novel forms of instruction and build on current educational models. Artificial intelligence, which has already seen numerous applications in ophthalmology, may be used to facilitate surgical tracking and evaluation. Within immersive technology, growth in the space of virtual reality head-mounted displays has created intriguing possibilities for operating room simulation and observation. Here, we explore the applications of these technologies and comment on their future in ophthalmic surgical education.", "Deep learning is an important branch of artificial intelligence that has been successfully applied into medicine and two-dimensional ligand design. The three-dimensional (3D) ligand generation in the 3D pocket of protein target is an interesting and challenging issue for drug design by deep learning. Here, the MolAICal software is introduced to supply a way for generating 3D drugs in the 3D pocket of protein targets by combining with merits of deep learning model and classical algorithm. The MolAICal software mainly contains two modules for 3D drug design. In the first module of MolAICal, it employs the genetic algorithm, deep learning model trained by FDA-approved drug fragments and Vinardo score fitting on the basis of PDBbind database for drug design. In the second module, it uses deep learning generative model trained by drug-like molecules of ZINC database and molecular docking invoked by Autodock Vina automatically. Besides, the Lipinski's rule of five, Pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS), synthetic accessibility (SA) and other user-defined rules are introduced for filtering out unwanted ligands in MolAICal. To show the drug design modules of MolAICal, the membrane protein glucagon receptor and non-membrane protein SARS-CoV-2 main protease are chosen as the investigative drug targets. The results show MolAICal can generate the various and novel ligands with good binding scores and appropriate XLOGP values. We believe that MolAICal can use the advantages of deep learning model and classical programming for designing 3D drugs in protein pocket. MolAICal is freely for any nonprofit purpose and accessible at https://molaical.github.io.", "Medulloblastoma has recently been characterized as a heterogeneous disease with 4 distinct molecular subgroups: wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), group 3, and group 4, with a new definition of risk stratification. We report progression-free survival, overall survival, and long-term cognitive effects in children with standard-risk medulloblastoma exclusively treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HFRT), reduced boost volume, and online quality control, and we explore the prognostic value of biological characteristics in this chemotherapy-na\u00efve population.\nPatients with standard-risk medulloblastoma were enrolled in 2 successive prospective multicentric studies, MSFOP 98 and MSFOP 2007, and received exclusive HFRT (36 Gy, 1 Gy/fraction twice daily) to the craniospinal axis followed by a boost at 68 Gy restricted to the tumor bed (1.5 cm margin), with online quality assurance before treatment. Patients with MYC or MYCN amplification were not excluded at the time of the study. We report progression-free survival and overall survival in the global population, and according to molecular subgroups as per World Health Organization 2016 molecular classification, and we present cognitive evaluations based on the Wechsler scale.\nData from 114 patients included in the MSFOP 98 trial from December 1998 to October 2001 (n = 48) and in the MSFOP 2007 from October 2008 to July 2013 (n = 66) were analyzed. With a median follow-up of 16.2 (range, 6.4-19.6) years for the MSFOP 98 cohort and 6.5 (1.6-9.6) years for the MSFOP 2007 cohort, 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival in the global population were 84% (74%-89%) and 74% (65%-81%), respectively. Molecular classification was determined for 91 patients (WNT [n = 19], SHH [n = 12], and non-WNT/non-SHH [n = 60]-including group 3 [n = 9], group 4 [n = 29], and not specified [n = 22]). Our results showed more favorable outcome for the WNT-activated subgroup and a worse prognosis for SHH-activated patients. Three patients had isolated extra-central nervous system relapse. The slope of neurocognitive decline in the global population was shallower than that observed in patients with a normofractionated regimen combined with chemotherapy.\nHFRT led to a 5-year survival rate similar to other treatments combined with chemotherapy, with a reduced treatment duration of only 6 weeks. We confirm the MSFOP 98 results and the prognostic value of molecular status in patients with medulloblastoma, even in the absence of chemotherapy. Intelligence quotient was more preserved in children with medulloblastoma who received exclusive HFRT and reduced local boost, and intelligence quotient decline was delayed compared with patients receiving standard regimen. HFRT may be appropriate for patients who do not consent to or are not eligible for prospective clinical trials; for patients from developing countries for whom aplasia or ileus may be difficult to manage in a context of high cost/effectiveness constraints; and for whom shortened duration of RT may be easier to implement.", "Organophosphate pesticides are widely used in agriculture and for other purposes, leading to ubiquitous exposure in human populations. Some studies reported cognitive deficits in children exposed prenatally to organophosphate pesticides, but findings from recent studies were inconsistent. Furthermore, recent biomonitoring studies suggest exposure levels have decreased. Hence, the risks from current prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides for child neurodevelopment are uncertain. Furthermore, sex-differences also remain to be better documented in relation to potential neurodevelopmental effects.\nTo examine the association between prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides and IQ scores among boys and girls living in several major Canadian cities.\nWe used data from the MIREC cohort (Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals). Women were recruited in 2008-2011 from 10 Canadian cities during their first trimester of pregnancy, and urine spot samples were collected for measurement of three dimethyl alkyl phosphate (DMAP) and three diethyl alkyl phosphate (DEAP) metabolites. When children were 3-4 years of age, we used the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-III (WPPSI-III) to assess cognitive ability of children from 6 out of the 10 cities (Halifax, Hamilton, Kingston, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver). We analysed the association between maternal exposure to organophosphate pesticides (DMAP and DEAP urinary metabolites) and children's IQ scores with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to take into account the clustered-data resulting from the six study sites. All analyses were sex-stratified (n\u00a0=\u00a0296 boys and 311 girls).\nThe participants were predominantly well-educated, white women, with a relatively high household income. Children had a mean age of 3.4 years at the moment of IQ assessment (range, 3.0-4.1 years). In girls, there was no association between IQ scores and DEAPs or DMAPs. Higher concentrations of DEAPs were significantly associated with poorer Verbal IQ scores (for a 10-fold increase in concentrations, -6.28; 95% CIs, -12.13, -0.43) in boys. The association for Performance IQ in boys also indicated poorer scores with higher DEAP concentrations, but the confidence intervals included the null value (-4.05; 95% CIs, -10.19, 2.10). The relation between DMAPs and IQ scores in boys was also negative, but association estimates were small and not significant.\nUrinary metabolites of organophosphate pesticides were not associated with IQ in girls, but we observed that higher maternal urinary DEAPs were associated with poorer Verbal IQ in boys. However, exposure misclassification may be an issue as only one urine sample per woman was analysed. The present study contributes to the accumulating evidence linking exposure to organophosphate pesticides during fetal development with poorer cognitive function in children, bringing data on the risks in a context of low exposure levels encountered in primarily urban populations from Canada.", "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children is associated with cognitive dysfunction that affects school performance and quality of life. The relationship between CKD-mineral and bone disorder and cognitive function in children is unknown.\nObservational study.\n702 children enrolled in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) Study.\nPlasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus, 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D).\nNeurocognitive tests of intelligence, academic achievement, and executive functions.\nLinear regression models to analyze the cross-sectional associations between log2FGF-23, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, PTH, calcium, and phosphorus z scores and the cognitive test scores of interest after adjustment for demographics, blood pressure, proteinuria, and kidney function.\nAt baseline, median age was 12 (95% CI, 8.3, 15.2) years and estimated glomerular filtration rate was 54 (40.5, 67.8) mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2. In fully adjusted analyses, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, PTH, calcium, and phosphorus z scores did not associate with cognitive test scores. In fully adjusted analyses, log2FGF-23 was associated with abnormal test scores for attention regulation (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); specifically, Conners' Continuous Performance Test II Errors of Omission (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a02.3\u00a0[1.0, 3.6]), Variability (\u03b2=1.4 [0.4,\u00a0-2.4]), and Hit Reaction Time (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.3\u00a0[0.2, 2.4]). Children in the highest FGF-23 tertile group had 7% and 9% greater cognitive risk for\u00a0Hit Reaction Time and Errors of Omission compared with those in the lowest tertile, respectively. In fully adjusted analyses, higher FGF-23 tertile was associated with increased cognitive risk (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) for Errors of Omission (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.4\u00a0[0.1,\u00a00.7]) and Hit Reaction Time (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.4\u00a0[0.1, 0.7]).\nThe study does not assess the cumulative\u00a0effects of FGF-23 excess on cognitive function over time. Within-population stratified analyses were not performed due to limited sample size.\nIn children with CKD, higher plasma FGF-23 level is associated with lower performance in targeted tests of executive function, specifically attention regulation, independent of glomerular filtration rate.", "Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) is one of the receptors of innate immunity. It is activated by Pathogen- and Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) and triggers pro-inflammatory responses that belong to the repertoire of innate immune responses, consequently protecting against infectious challenges and boosting adaptive immunity. Mild TLR4 stimulation by non-toxic molecules resembling its natural agonist (lipid A) provided efficient vaccine adjuvants. The non-toxic TLR4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) has been approved for clinical use. This suggests the development of other TLR4 agonists as adjuvants or drugs for cancer immunotherapy. TLR4 excessive activation by a Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to sepsis, while TLR4 stimulation by DAMPs is a common mechanism in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. TLR4 inhibition by small molecules and antibodies could therefore provide access to innovative therapeutics targeting sepsis as well as acute and chronic inflammations. The potential use of TLR4 antagonists as anti-inflammatory drugs with unique selectivity and a new mechanism of action compared to corticosteroids or other non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs fueled the search for compounds of natural or synthetic origin able to block or inhibit TLR4 activation and signaling. The wide spectrum of clinical settings to which TLR4 inhibitors can be applied include autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases), vascular inflammation, neuroinflammations, and neurodegenerative diseases. The last advances (from 2017) in TLR4 activation or inhibition by small molecules (molecular weight <2 kDa) are reviewed here. Studies on pre-clinical validation of new chemical entities (drug hits) on cellular or animal models as well as new clinical studies on previously developed TLR4 modulators are reported. Innovative TLR4 modulators discovered by computer-assisted drug design and an artificial intelligence approach are described. Some \"old\" TLR4 agonists or antagonists such as MPLA or Eritoran are under study for repositioning in different pharmacological contexts. The mechanism of action of the molecules and the level of TLR4 involvement in their biological activity are critically discussed.", "Emotional communications play an important role in having a satisfying relationship and a more successful marriage. If marriage does not provide suitable conditions to satisfy couple's needs, not only it does not help to mental health but also results in negative and irreversible effects.\nThis research was performed with the aim of determining the impact of emotional intelligence training on marital satisfaction, sexual quality of life, and psychological well-being of women.\nThe present research is an experimental study conducted on 70 women referring to community health centers of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in 2019.\nThe sampling was performed using multistage cluster sampling. Before implementing the training intervention, the research instruments (general questionnaire, Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale, Iranian version of Sexual Quality of Life-Female questionnaire, and World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index) were provided to the participants in order to complete them. All participants recompleted the instruments immediately and 1 month after the training intervention.\nThe significance level was considered as P < 0.05.\nThe mean scores of marital satisfaction in the control group had no significant difference before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention (P = 0.895). However, in the intervention group, over time, the mean scores of marital satisfaction increased (P = 0.001), and the difference between the two groups was significant (P < 0.001). The mean scores of sexual quality of life and psychological well-being had no significant differences before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention in the control group. However, in the intervention group, over time, the mean scores of sexual quality of life and psychological well-being firstly increased and then decreased (P < 0.001), and the difference between the two groups was significant (P < 0.001).\nTraining the components of emotional intelligence can be effective on enhancing marital satisfaction, sexual quality of life, and psychological well-being of women.", "Health care providers and educators play critical roles in supporting healthy sexuality development for youth with autism spectrum disorder. There is limited information about the sexual behavior of these youth, especially girls, and about their access to sexuality education or health care services.\nThis study addressed these gaps by surveying parents of youth with autism aged 12-18 years (N = 298, 52.7% boys) with a range of intellectual functioning.\nAccording to parent report, most youth experienced sexual attraction and were interested in relationships, including same-sex attraction or relationships (13.2%). Girls were more likely than boys to have had a romantic relationship and less likely to have experienced school or legal consequences for sexual behavior. Around one-fifth of youth had engaged in a socially inappropriate sexual behavior, whereas 6.4% had a known sexual abuse history and 14.5% were bullied by peers for lack of sexual knowledge. Almost 40% received no sex education in school or in the community, including 60.9% of youth with parent-reported intelligence quotient under 70. Some parents consulted with school personnel (36.4%) or health care providers (55.9%) about sexuality issues, whereas 19.5% reported taking no action aside from talking to their child about sexuality. Utilization models including predisposing, enabling, and needs-related factors were applied to parent consultation with providers and use of school-based sexuality education programming.\nThe results suggest unmet needs for sexual and reproductive health services, particularly among youth who are younger, those who have co-occurring intellectual disability, or those who are homeschooled or who attend private, charter, or therapeutic versus public schools.", "While character strengths have been found to predict educational outcomes beyond broad personality traits and cognitive ability, little is known about their differential contribution to success and positive learning experiences in different school settings. In this study, we use trait activation theory to investigate the relationships of students' character strengths with achievement, flow experiences, and enjoyment in different learning situations (i.e., teacher-centered learning, individual tasks, and group work). In studying these relationships, we controlled for psychometric intelligence. Secondary school students (N = 255; 46.3% male; mean age = 14.5 years) completed a self-report measure of character strengths, the VIA-Youth (Park and Peterson, 2006b). Cognitive ability was assessed using a standardized intelligence test (PSB-R; Horn et al., 2003) at baseline. Three months later, students completed the Flow Short Scale (Rheinberg et al., 2003) adapted to the three learning situations and indicated their typical enjoyment of these situations. Both the students and their teachers (N = 18; 50% male; mean age = 44.8 years) provided ratings on school achievement in each of the three learning situations. Results indicate that, as expected, (a) certain character strengths (love of learning and perseverance) show consistent relationships with achievement and positive learning experiences (flow and enjoyment) above and beyond cognitive ability across all learning situations, whereas (b) other character strengths show differential trait-outcome relationships (e.g., the character strength of teamwork was predictive of achievement and positive learning experiences in group work). Taken together, these results suggest that different character strengths play a role in different school situations and that their contribution to explaining variance in educational outcomes is incremental to the contribution of cognitive ability.", "Cooperation in human groups is challenging, and various mechanisms are required to sustain it, although it nevertheless usually decays over time. Here, we perform theoretically informed experiments involving networks of humans (1,024 subjects in 64 networks) playing a public-goods game to which we sometimes added autonomous agents (bots) programmed to use only local knowledge. We show that cooperation can not only be stabilized, but even promoted, when the bots intervene in the partner selections made by the humans, re-shaping social connections locally within a larger group. Cooperation rates increased from 60.4% at baseline to 79.4% at the end. This network-intervention strategy outperformed other strategies, such as adding bots playing tit-for-tat. We also confirm that even a single bot can foster cooperation in human groups by using a mixed strategy designed to support the development of cooperative clusters. Simple artificial intelligence can increase the cooperation of groups.", "As a third of people with diabetes mellitus (DM) will suffer the microvascular complications of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and therapeutic options can effectively prevent visual impairment, systematic screening has substantially reduced disease burden in developed countries. In an effort to tackle the rising incidence of DM, screening programmes have modernized in synchrony with technical and infrastructural advancements. Patient evaluation has shifted from face-to-face ophthalmologist-based review delivered through community grassroots to asynchronous store-and-forward modern telemedicine platforms commissioned on a nationwide scale. First pioneered with primitive 35-mm slide film retinal photography, the last decade has seen an emergence of high resolution and widefield imaging devices, which may reveal extents of DR indiscernible to the clinician but with implications of potential earlier identification. Similar progress has been seen in image analysis approaches - automated image analysis of retinal photographs of DR has evolved from qualitative feature detection to rules-based algorithms to autonomous artificial intelligence-powered classification. Such models have, relatively rapidly, been validated and are now receiving approval from health regulation authorities with deployment into the clinical sphere. In this review, we chart the evolution of global DR screening programmes since their inception highlighting major milestones in healthcare infrastructure, telemedicine approaches and imaging devices that have shaped the robust and effective frameworks recognised today. We also provide an outlook for the future of DR screening in the context of recent technological advancements with respect to their limitations in current times.", "Although deep learning has been explored extensively for computer-aided medical imaging diagnosis in human medicine, very little has been done in veterinary medicine. The goal of this retrospective, pilot project was to apply the deep learning artificial intelligence technique using thoracic radiographs for detection of canine left atrial enlargement and compare results with those of veterinary radiologist interpretations. Seven hundred ninety-two right lateral radiographs from canine patients with thoracic radiographs and contemporaneous echocardiograms were used to train, validate, and test a convolutional neural network algorithm. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for determination of left atrial enlargement were then compared with those of board-certified veterinary radiologists as recorded on radiology reports. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 82.71%, 68.42%, and 87.09%, respectively, using an accuracy driven variant of the convolutional neural network algorithm and 79.01%, 73.68%, and 80.64%, respectively, using a sensitivity driven variant. By comparison, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity achieved by board-certified veterinary radiologists was 82.71%, 68.42%, and 87.09%, respectively. Although overall accuracy of the accuracy driven convolutional neural network algorithm and veterinary radiologists was identical, concordance between the two approaches was 85.19%. This study documents proof-of-concept for application of deep learning techniques for computer-aided diagnosis in veterinary medicine.", "Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) has evolved since its first introduction in the 1970s as an imaging technique to detect and survey disease across multiple sites and organ systems in the body. The development of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has added a new dimension to the implementation of WB-MRI on modern scanners, offering excellent lesion-to-background contrast, while achieving acceptable spatial resolution to detect focal lesions 5 to 10\u2009mm in size. MRI hardware and software advances have reduced acquisition times, with studies taking 40-50\u2009min to complete.The rising awareness of medical radiation exposure coupled with the advantages of MRI has resulted in increased utilization of WB-MRI in oncology, paediatrics, rheumatological and musculoskeletal conditions and more recently in population screening. There is recognition that WB-MRI can be used to track disease evolution and monitor response heterogeneity in patients with cancer. There are also opportunities to combine WB-MRI with molecular imaging on PET-MRI systems to harness the strengths of hybrid imaging. The advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning will shorten image acquisition times and image analyses, making the technique more competitive against other imaging technologies.", "In the past 10 years, the methods of artificial intelligence (AI) have experienced breakthroughs that have opened up a multitude of new fields of application for information technology. AI is particularly strong in those areas where patterns have to be recognized and conclusions and forecasts based on large, multiparametric data sets have to be drawn. Computers are superior to us in terms of precision and speed in these problems. These advances in information technology reach us at a time when innovations in diagnostics and sensor technology enable more precise patient stratification and confront medical personnel with an increasing quantity and quality of patient data. Urology is symbolic of this new complexity of medicine, in which multi-layered diagnostic cascades require a high degree of interdisciplinarity and, especially in uro-oncology, therapeutic strategies are becoming more differentiated and require the interpretation of multiple clinical and diagnostic data. Here, methods of Artificial Intelligence will in future support medical personnel in diagnostics and therapy decisions and thus come closer to the goal of precision medicine. A prerequisite for the success of AI-based support tools will be the transparent development and validation of the software, as well as the population-based visualization of decision parameters.\nIn den vergangenen 10\u00a0Jahren haben die Methoden der K\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz (KI) Durchbr\u00fcche erfahren, die der Informationstechnologie eine Vielzahl neuer Einsatzfelder er\u00f6ffnete. Dabei spielt die KI besonders dort ihre St\u00e4rken aus, wo in gro\u00dfen, multiparametrischen Datenmengen Muster erkannt und R\u00fcckschl\u00fcsse, sowie Prognosen auf deren Basis gezogen werden m\u00fcssen. Bei diesen Problemstellungen sind uns Computer in Sachen Pr\u00e4zision und Geschwindigkeit \u00fcberlegen. Diese informationstechnologischen Fortschritte erreichen uns in einer Zeit, in der Innovationen in Diagnostik und Sensorik eine pr\u00e4zisere Patientenstratifikation erm\u00f6glichen und das medizinische Personal mit einer wachsenden Quantit\u00e4t und Qualit\u00e4t an Patientendaten konfrontieren. Die Urologie steht sinnbildlich f\u00fcr diese neue Komplexit\u00e4t der Medizin, in der vielschichtige Diagnostikkaskaden ein hohes Ma\u00df an Interdisziplinarit\u00e4t erfordern und, insbesondere in der Uroonkologie, die Therapiestrategien ausdifferenzierter werden und die Interpretation multipler klinischer und diagnostischer Daten erfordern. Hier werden Methoden der KI in Zukunft das medizinische Personal bei Diagnostik und Therapieentscheidung unterst\u00fctzen und damit dem Ziel der Pr\u00e4zisionsmedizin n\u00e4herkommen. Voraussetzung f\u00fcr den Erfolg KI-basierter Unterst\u00fctzungstools wird die transparente Entwicklung und Validierung der Software, sowie die populationsbasierte Visualisierung von Entscheidungsparametern.", "As a subset of artificial intelligence, machine learning techniques (MLTs) may evaluate very large and raw datasets. In this study, the aim is to establish a model by MLT for the prediction of enuresis in children.\nThe study included 8,071 elementary school students. A total of 704 children had enuresis. For analysis of data with MLT, another group including 704 nonenuretic children was structured with stratified sampling. Out of 34 independent variables, 14 with high feature values significantly affecting enuresis were selected. A model of estimation was created by training the data.\nFourteen independent variables in order of feature importance value were starting age of toilet training, having urinary urgency, holding maneuvers to prevent voiding, frequency of defecation, history of enuresis in mother and father, having child's own room, parent's education level, history of enuresis in siblings, consanguineous marriage, incomplete bladder emptying, frequent voiding, gender, history of urinary tract infection, and surgery in the past. The best MLT algorithm for the prediction of enuresis was determined as logistic regression algorithm. The total accuracy rate of the model in prediction was 81.3%.\nMLT might provide a faster and easier evaluation process for studies on enuresis with a large dataset. The model in this study may suggest that selected variables with high feature values could be preferred with priority in any screening studies for enuresis. MLT may prevent clinical errors due to human cognitive biases and may help the physicians to be proactive in diagnosis and treatment of enuresis.", "Multi-parameters patient monitors are widely used in hospitals as medical device products, which have important clinical value. It expounds the core technologies of a miniature wearable multi-parameters patient monitor, and looks forward to its application prospects. In addition to traditional applications, when combined with a networked health service platforms, its applications will be greatly expanded in the context of big data and artificial intelligence technologies. The laboratory prototype of this product has been completed and has achieved the anticipative design goal.", "To review and systematize literature data on the incidence of cysts of septum pellucidum, cavum vergae and cavum veli interpositi, their clinical manifestations, indications for surgical treatment and optimal surgical approach.\nAn analysis included 72 manuscripts devoted to epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical symptoms and results of surgical treatment of brain cysts. Case reports, series of cases, reviews and original studies were analyzed.\nSeptum pellucidum cavity is always formed throughout an embryogenesis and persists in 20.34% of adults. Cavum vergae is observed in 2.32% of adults. Cyst of septum pellucidum is detected in 0.04% of adults. Analysis of 368 cases of cysts of septum pellucidum, cavum vergae and cavum veli interpositi has shown that clinical picture consists of headache (50% of cases), convulsive syndrome (23.6%), reduced intelligence (20.1%), behavioural disorders (15.8%), dizziness, nausea and vomiting (10.9%). Hydrocephalus occurs in 16.6% of cases. Endoscopic wall fenestration is preferred for cyst management.\nBrain cysts are rare and characterized by non-specific clinical manifestations. Symptomatic cyst is an indication for surgical treatment. Surgical treatment usually ensures regression of symptoms and low risk of complications.\n\u041e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u0438

growth of ectopic endometrium outside the uterus. Given its still unknown etiology, treatments usually aim at diminishing pain and/or achieving pregnancy. Despite some progress in defining mode-of-action for drug development, the lack of reliable animal models indicates that novel approaches are required. The difficulties inherent to modeling endometriosis are related to its multifactorial nature, a condition that hinders the recreation of its pathology and the identification of clinically relevant metrics to assess drug efficacy. In this review, we report and comment endometriosis models and how they have led to new therapies. We envision a roadmap for endometriosis research, integrating Artificial Intelligence, three-dimensional cultures and organ-on-chip models as ways to achieve better understanding of physiopathological features and better tailored effective treatments.", "Various traditions have investigated the relationship between emotion and language. For the basic emotions view, emotional prototypes are lexically sedimented in language, evidenced in cultural convergence in emotional recognition and expression tasks. For constructionist theories, conceptual knowledge supported by language is at the core of emotions. Understanding emotion words is embedded in various interrelated constructs such as emotional intelligence, emotion knowledge or emotion differentiation, and is related to, but different from, general vocabulary. A clear advantage of Emotion Vocabulary over most emotion-related constructs is that it can be measured objectively. In two successive corpus-based studies, we tested the predictions of concordance and absolute agreement on the frequency of use of a total of 100 Spanish emotion labels in the eight main Spanish-speaking areas: Spain, Mexico-Central America, River Plate, Continental Caribbean, Andean, Antilles, Chilean, and the United States. In both studies, the intraclass correlation coefficient was statistically different from the null and very large, over .95, as was the Kendall's concordance coefficient, indicating broad consensus among the Spanish linguistic areas. From an applied perspective, our results provide supporting evidence for the similarity in frequency, and therefore cross-cultural generalizability regarding familiarity of the 100 emotion labels as item stems or as experimental stimuli without going through a process of additional adaptation. On a broader scope, these results add evidence on the role of language for emotion theories. In this regard, countries and regions compared here share the same Spanish language, but differ in several aspects in history, culture, and socio-economic structure.", "Radiomics is a quantitative approach to medical imaging, which aims at enhancing the existing data available to clinicians by means of advanced mathematical analysis. Through mathematical extraction of the spatial distribution of signal intensities and pixel interrelationships, radiomics quantifies textural information by using analysis methods from the field of artificial intelligence. Various studies from different fields in imaging have been published so far, highlighting the potential of radiomics to enhance clinical decision-making. However, the field faces several important challenges, which are mainly caused by the various technical factors influencing the extracted radiomic features.The aim of the present review is twofold: first, we present the typical workflow of a radiomics analysis and deliver a practical \"how-to\" guide for a typical radiomics analysis. Second, we discuss the current limitations of radiomics, suggest potential improvements, and summarize relevant literature on the subject.", "It has been shown that the capacity of visual working memory (VWM) is a strong predictor of individual intelligence, and researchers have developed various training protocols to improve VWM capacity. However, it seems that whether the fidelity of internal representation in VWM can also be improved by training is largely overlooked in the past literature. Here, we introduced a new training approach that involved increasing the perceptual difficulty of training materials to enhance VWM, and both memory capacity and the fidelity of representation were examined to assess the training efficacy. Participants with normal vision and cognitive abilities received 3-week training on VWM using a change detection task, and the results showed that both the capacity and the fidelity of memory representations were improved for training with perceptually difficult stimuli, while only the fidelity was improved for training with perceptually normal stimuli. In addition, we found that the training effects on memory precision may be subject to capacity constraints. We suggest that long-term adaptive training with perceptually difficult stimuli may facilitate encoding efficiency through familiarizing trainees with an increased baseline of cognitive workload during the encoding process. The present study offers clear evidence that training with high perceptual difficulty is more effective and the improvements in VWM are more stable than training with perceptually normal materials, and the simple manipulation on training stimuli indicates that the method can be generalized to a wider range of training situations and populations.", "Objectives. This study aimed to assess cognitive and skill performance at sitting and standing workstations among students from Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Methods. Forty students (20 females and 20 males) participated in this quasi-experimental study. Tests were performed among randomly selected participants over two consecutive days: day 1, the Beck depression inventory and Beck anxiety inventory were used to assess the severity of depression and anxiety in the study participants, respectively, and Raven's general intelligence test was used to measure intelligence quotient; day 2, five performance assessment tests (cognitive performance assessment tests 'n-back', 'Stroop' and 'advanced reaction time'; skill performance assessment tests 'two-arm coordination' and 'Purdue pegboard') were randomly selected and presented to individuals at each workstation (sitting and standing workstations). At the end of each sitting and standing position, the comfort of the workstation was measured using a visual analog scale. Results. No statistically significant difference was shown between sitting and standing positions in terms of 'n-back', 'Stroop', 'advanced reaction time', 'two-arm coordination' and 'Purdue pegboard'. Participants were more comfortable in sitting positions and more easily distracted in standing positions. Conclusions. Sitting and standing positions had no significant effects on participants' cognitive and skill performance.", "Mind-body training (MBT) programs are effective interventions for relieving stress and improving psychological capabilities. To expand our previous study which demonstrated the short-term effects of an 8-week online MBT program, the present study investigated whether those short-term effects persist up to a month after the end of the intervention.Among previous participants, 56 (64%) participated in this follow-up study, 25 in the MBT group and 31 in the control group. Outcome measures included the stress response, emotional intelligence, resilience, coping strategies, positive and negative affect, and anger expression of both groups at baseline, at 8 weeks (right after the training or waiting period), and at 12 weeks (a month after the training or waiting period).The MBT group showed a greater decrease in stress response at 8 weeks, and this reduction remained a month after the end of the intervention. The effect of MBT on resilience and effective coping strategies was also significant at 8 weeks and remained constant a month later. However, the improvement to emotional intelligence and negative affect did not persist a month after training.These findings suggest that the beneficial short-term effects of MBT may last beyond the training period even without continuous practice, but the retention of these benefits seems to depend on the outcome variables. Through a convenient, affordable, and easily accessible online format, MBT may provide cost-effective solutions for employees at worksites.", "In recent decades, the advancement of computational algorithms and the availability of big data have enabled artificial intelligence (AI) to dramatically improve predictive performance in nearly all research areas. Specifically, machine learning (ML) techniques, a major branch of AI, have been widely used in many tasks of drug discovery and development, including predicting treatment effects, identifying target genes and functional pathways, as well as selecting potential biomarkers. However, in practice, blindly applying ML methods may lead to common pitfalls, including overfitting and lack of generalizability. Therefore, how to improve the robustness and prediction accuracy of ML methods has become a crucial problem for researchers. In this review, we summarize the application of ML models to drug discovery by introducing the top-performing methods developed from large-scale drug-related data challenges in recent years.", "The purpose of this study was to test if different intensities of aerobic exercise could influence abdominal fat, isoforms of BDNF and executive function. Twenty obese men (30.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.4\u00a0years old; 34.4\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5\u00a0kg/m2) were randomized to moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT, n\u2009=\u200910) and high-intensity intermittent training (HIIT, n\u2009=\u200910) three times a week for 6\u00a0weeks, with isoenergetic energetic expenditure for each exercise session (~\u2009300\u00a0kcal) between conditions. Abdominal fat was assessed pre- and post-intervention; executive function (Coding subtest from BETA-III non-verbal intelligence test and Stroop Color and Word Test), concentrations of mBDNF and proBDNF were assessed in response to acute exercise pre- and post-intervention. Abdominal fat did not change in either group. There was a significant increase in mBDNF immediately after acute exercise in both groups before and after intervention. proBDNF did not present changes acutely nor after 6 weeks. Executive function presented a main effect of time at pre- and post-intervention time-points Stroop Word and Stroop Color and Coding subtest presented improved performance from pre- to post-acute exercise session, in both groups. In conclusion, executive function improvements and acute exercise session-induced increases in mBDNF concentration were found from pre- to post-exercise intervention similarly between MICT and HIIT in obese men.", "Biomineralization research examines structure-function relations in all types of exo- and endo-skeletons and other hard tissues of living organisms, and it relies heavily on 3D imaging. Segmentation of 3D renderings of biomineralized structures has long been a bottleneck because of human limitations such as our available time, attention span, eye-hand coordination, cognitive biases, and attainable precision, amongst other limitations. Since recently, some of these routine limitations appear to be surmountable thanks to the development of deep-learning algorithms for biological imagery in general, and for 3D image segmentation in particular. Many components of deep learning often appear too abstract for a life scientist. Despite this, the basic principles underlying deep learning have many easy-to-grasp commonalities with human learning and universal logic. This primer presents these basic principles in what we feel is an intuitive manner, without relying on prerequisite knowledge of informatics and computer science, and with the aim of improving the reader's general literacy in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Here, biomineralization case studies are presented to illustrate the application of deep learning for solving segmentation and analysis problems of 3D images ridden by various artifacts, and/or which are plainly difficult to interpret. The presented portfolio of case studies includes three examples of imaging using micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT), and three examples using focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), all on mineralized tissues. We believe this primer will expand the circle of users of deep learning amongst biomineralization researchers and other life scientists involved with 3D imaging, and will encourage incorporation of this powerful tool into their professional skillsets and to explore it further.", "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate in a multicenter dataset the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) detection system with attention mapping compared with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) interpretation in the detection of prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS. MRI examinations from five institutions were included in this study and were evaluated by nine readers. In the first round, readers evaluated mpMRI studies using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2. After 4 weeks, images were again presented to readers along with the AI-based detection system output. Readers accepted or rejected lesions within four AI-generated attention map boxes. Additional lesions outside of boxes were excluded from detection and categorization. The performances of readers using the mpMRI-only and AI-assisted approaches were compared. RESULTS. The study population included 152 case patients and 84 control patients with 274 pathologically proven cancer lesions. The lesion-based AUC was 74.9% for MRI and 77.5% for AI with no significant difference (p = 0.095). The sensitivity for overall detection of cancer lesions was higher for AI than for mpMRI but did not reach statistical significance (57.4% vs 53.6%, p = 0.073). However, for transition zone lesions, sensitivity was higher for AI than for MRI (61.8% vs 50.8%, p = 0.001). Reading time was longer for AI than for MRI (4.66 vs 4.03 minutes, p < 0.001). There was moderate interreader agreement for AI and MRI with no significant difference (58.7% vs 58.5%, p = 0.966). CONCLUSION. Overall sensitivity was only minimally improved by use of the AI system. Significant improvement was achieved, however, in the detection of transition zone lesions with use of the AI system at the cost of a mean of 40 seconds of additional reading time.", "COVID-19 pneumonia is a newly recognized lung infection. Initially, CT imaging was demonstrated to be one of the most sensitive tests for the detection of infection. Currently, with broader availability of polymerase chain reaction for disease diagnosis, CT is mainly used for the identification of complications and other defined clinical indications in hospitalized patients. Nonetheless, radiologists are interpreting lung imaging in unsuspected patients as well as in suspected patients with imaging obtained to rule out other relevant clinical indications. The knowledge of pathological findings is also crucial for imagers to better interpret various imaging findings. Identification of the imaging findings that are commonly seen with the disease is important to diagnose and suggest confirmatory testing in unsuspected cases. Proper precautionary measures will be important in such unsuspected patients to prevent further spread. In addition to understanding the imaging findings for the diagnosis of the disease, it is important to understand the growing set of tools provided by artificial intelligence. The goal of this review is to highlight common imaging findings using illustrative examples, describe the evolution of disease over time, discuss differences in imaging appearance of adult and pediatric patients and review the available literature on quantitative CT for COVID-19. We briefly address the known pathological findings of the COVID-19 lung disease that may help better understand the imaging appearance, and we provide a demonstration of novel display methodologies and artificial intelligence applications serving to support clinical observations.", "Nowadays, artificial intelligence plays an integral role in medical and healthcare informatics. Developing an automatic question classification and answering system is essential for coping with constant advancements in science and technology. However, efficient online medical services are required to promote offline medical services. This article proposes a system that automatically classifies medical questions of patients into medical specialities and supports the Arabic language in the MENA region. Text classification is not trivial, especially when dealing with a highly morphologically complex language, the dialectical form of which is the dominant form on the Internet. This work utilizes 15,000 medical questions asked by the clients of Altibbi telemedicine company. The questions are classified into 15 medical specialities. As the number of medical questions received daily by the company has increased, a need has arisen for an automatic classification system that can save the medical personnel much time and effort. Therefore, this article presents an efficient medical speciality classification system based on swarm intelligence (SI) and an ensemble of support vector machines (SVMs). Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an SI-based and stochastic metaheuristic algorithm that is adopted to search for the optimal number of features and tune the hyperparameters of the SVM classifiers, which are deployed as one-versus-rest for multi-class classification. In addition, PSO is integrated with various binarization techniques to boost its performance. The experimental results show that the proposed approach accomplished remarkable performance as it achieved an accuracy of 85% and a features reduction rate of 95.9%.", "This study was designed to investigate Artificial Intelligence in Dental Radiology (AIDR) videos on YouTube in terms of popularity, content, reliability, and educational quality.\nTwo researchers systematically searched about AIDR on YouTube on January 27, 2020, by using the terms \"artificial intelligence in dental radiology,\" \"machine learning in dental radiology,\" and \"deep learning in dental radiology.\" The search was performed in English, and 60 videos for each keyword were assessed. Video source, content type, time since upload, duration, and number of views, likes, and dislikes were recorded. Video popularity was reported using Video Power Index (VPI). The accuracy and reliability of the source of information were measured using the adapted DISCERN score. The quality of the videos was measured using JAMAS and modified Global Quality Score (mGQS) and content via Total Concent Evaluation (TCE).\nThere was high interobserver agreement for DISCERN (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.975; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.957-0.985; P: 0.000; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and mGQS (ICC: 0.904; 95% CI: 0.841-0.943; P: 0.000; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Academic source videos had higher DISCERN, GQS, and TCE, revealing both reliability and quality. Also, positive relationship of VPI with mGQS (30.1%) (P: 0.035) and DISCERN (38.1%) (P: 0.007) is detected. The scores revealed 51.9% relationship between mGQS and DISCERN (P: 0.001); and educational quality predictor scores revealed 62.5% relationship between TCE and GQS (P: 0.000).\nDespite the limited number of relevant videos, YouTube involves reliable and quality videos that can be used by dentists about learning AIDR.", "For all patients with cardiovascular disease requiring an intervention, this is a\u00a0major life event. The heart team concept is one of the most exciting and effective team modalities to ensure cost-effective application of invasive cardiovascular care. It optimises patient selection in a\u00a0complex decision-making process and identifies risk/benefit ratios of different interventions. Informed consent and patient safety should be at the centre of these decisions. To deal with increased load of medical data in the future, artificial intelligence could enable objective and effective interpretation of medical imaging and decision support. This technical support is indispensable to meet current patient and societal demands for informed consent, shared decision-making, outcome improvement and safety. The heart team should be restructured with clear leadership, accountability, and process and outcome measurement of interventions. In this way, the heart team concept in the Netherlands will be ready for the future.", "Previous studies have shown that an intellectually stimulating lifestyle is associated with a lower risk for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). It is unclear so far whether higher intelligence may protect against this. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the association between intelligence and cognitive decline and ADRD risk.\nWe searched the PubMed, web of science, and Scopus databases following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) criteria. Quality of evidence was assessed using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklists.\nFrom an initial n=8,371 search hits, n= 14 studies met the inclusion criteria and had sufficient quality. Evidence indicates that cognitive decline in old age is not significantly associated with childhood intelligence (n=9). Evidence with regard to ADRD risk is inconclusive (n=5) with some studies showing no effects and other studies with significant effects having limitations in their design.\nEven though the majority of the studies show no significant association, we cannot exclude a possible effect that might be moderated by other, so far unknown factors. Further studies are necessary to systematically assess the influence of intelligence on ADRD risk and what factors moderate this association.", "General cognitive ability, often referred to as 'general intelligence', comprises a variety of correlated abilities. Childhood general cognitive ability is a well-studied area of research and can be used to predict social outcomes and perceived success. Early life stage (e.g., prenatal, postnatal, toddler) exposures to stressors (i.e., chemical and non-chemical stressors from the total (built, natural, social) environment) can impact the development of childhood cognitive ability. Building from our systematic scoping review (Ruiz et al., 2016), we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate more than 100 stressors related to cognitive development. Our meta-analysis identified 23 stressors with a significant increase in their likelihood to influence childhood cognitive ability by 10% or more, and 80 stressors were observed to have a statistically significant effect on cognitive ability. Stressors most impactful to cognition during the prenatal period were related to maternal health and the mother's ability to access information relevant to a healthy pregnancy (e.g., diet, lifestyle). Stressors most impactful to cognition during the early childhood period were dietary nutrients (infancy), quality of social interaction (toddler), and exposure to toxic substances (throughout early childhood). In conducting this analysis, we examined the relative impact of real-world exposures on cognitive development to attempt to understand the inter-relationships between exposures to both chemical and non-chemical stressors and early developmental life stages. Our findings suggest that the stressors observed to be the most influential to childhood cognitive ability are not permanent and can be broadly categorized as activities/behaviors which can be modified to improve childhood cognition. This meta-analysis supports the idea that there are complex relationships between a child's total environment and early cognitive development.", "Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, and it may arise from a cutaneous pigmented lesion. As artificial intelligence (AI)-based teledermatology services hold promise in redefining the melanoma screening paradigm, a study that evaluates user satisfaction with a smartphone-compatible, AI-based cutaneous pigmented lesion evaluator is lacking.\nData was collected between April and May 2019 in Taiwan. To assess user satisfaction with MoleMe, an AI-based cutaneous pigmented lesion evaluator on a smartphone, users were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to evaluate four aspects, including interaction, impact on daily life, usability, and overall performance, after completing a MoleMe evaluation session. For each question, users could rank their satisfaction level from 1 to 5, with five showing strongly satisfied and one showing strongly unsatisfied. The Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare user satisfaction among different age groups, genders, and risk predictions received.\nA total of 1231 questionnaires were collected for analysis. Over 90% of the participants were satisfied (score\u00a0=\u00a04 or 5) and over 75% of the participants were strongly satisfied (score 5) with MoleMe, in terms of usability, interaction, and impact on daily life. The user satisfaction did not show a significant difference between genders, age groups, and risk predictions received. (all P > 0.05) CONCLUSION: With high user satisfaction regardless of age group, gender, and risk prediction received, AI-based teledermatology services on a smartphone such as MoleMe may potentially achieve widespread usage and be beneficial to both patients and physicians.", "In this paper, folic acid-coated graphene oxide nanocomposite (FA-GO) is used as an adsorbent for the treatment of heavy metals including cadmium (Cd2+) and copper (Cu2+) ions. As such, graphene oxide (GO) is modified by folic acid (FA) to synthesize FA-GO nanocomposite and characterized by the atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and C/H/N elemental analyses. Also, computational intelligence tests are used to study the mechanism of the interaction of FA molecules with GO. Based on the results, FA molecules formed a strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, chemical, and hydrogen bond interactions with functional groups of GO. Main parameters including pH of the sample solution, amounts of adsorbent, and contact time are studied and optimized by the Response Surface Methodology Based on Central Composite Design (RSM-CCD). In this study, the equilibrium of adsorption is appraised by two (Langmuir and Freundlich and Temkin and D-R models) and three parameter (Sips, Toth, and Khan models) isotherms. Based on the two parameter evaluations, Langmuir and Freundlich models have high accuracy according to the R2 coefficient (more than 0.9) in experimental curve fittings of each pollutant adsorption. But, multilayer adsorption of each contaminant onto the FA-GO adsorbent (Freundlich equation) is demonstrated by three parameter isotherm analysis. Also, isotherm calculations express maximum computational adsorption capacities of 103.1 and 116.3 mg g-1 for Cd2+ and Cu2+ ions, correspondingly. Kinetic models are scrutinized and the outcomes depict the adsorption of both Cd2+ and Cu2+ followed by the pseudo-second-order equation. Meanwhile, the results of the geometric model illustrate that the variation of adsorption and desorption rates do not have any interfering during the adsorption process. Finally, thermodynamic studies show that the adsorption of Cu2+ and Cd2+ onto the FA-GO nanocomposite is an endothermic and spontaneous process.", "The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak poses a serious public health risk. To date, the disease has affected almost all countries in the world. The enormous scale of the outbreak and the relative lack of knowledge and information regarding a new virus, as well as the unpredictability of events, make it challenging for leadership teams to respond. This paper shares how we have reconfigured our radiology leadership team into a smaller disease outbreak task force (DOTF) to respond and coordinate all related efforts during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The DOTF format is modelled after the military with domain groups looking at manpower, intelligence, operations, and logistics matters on a daily basis so that timely decisions can be made and action plans executed promptly. In managing the DOTF, discipline, flexibility, and teamwork are key principles, and these are built upon a strong foundation of focus on infection prevention and control, and patient and staff safety as well as staff well-being. The DOTF has positioned us well to confront the many challenges to date. We believe it will also help us navigate the complex issues that will arise with future surges in cases and in formulating strategies to manage exit from the present and future lockdowns. KEY POINTS: \u2022 In a pandemic, regular and directed meetings by a smaller leadership core group are required, for prompt decision making and execution of action plans. \u2022 The military format, with domain groups to look at manpower, intelligence, operations, and logistics matters, is useful in managing a pandemic. \u2022 Discipline, flexibility, and teamwork with strong focus on infection prevention and control, and patient and staff safety as well as staff well-being are key principles for leadership teams managing a pandemic.", "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune-mediated, inflammatory and demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. There have been a few studies in recent years on the fact that these cases have neurocognitive impairment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the neurocognitive outcome and quality of life in cases with ADEM.\nEleven cases who were on follow-up between 2008 and 2017 were included in the study, systemic, neurological and psychiatric examinations were done. All magnetic resonance images were re-evaluated. The neuropsychiatric evaluation was performed by clinical examination and psychometric scales; (1) The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0, (2) Child Behavior Checklist, (3) Children`s Depression Inventory, (4) The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised and (5) Continuous Performance Test. The cases in our study underwent neuropsychiatric evaluation 3-42 months after the diagnosis of ADEM had been established.\nNine cases (81.8%) fully recovered without neurologic deficit. One case (9.1%) had a psychiatric disorder. During follow-up, cognitive and psychiatric problems were encountered in half of the cases (54.5%). Most of the cases with basal ganglia involvement (80%) displayed attention deficit and cognitive problems.\nIn particular, cases with basal ganglia involvement should be followed carefully in terms of attention and cognitive problems.", "The number of older people with unmet care and support needs is increasing substantially due to the challenges facing the formal and informal care systems. Emerging technological developments have the potential to address some of the care and support challenges of older people. However, limited work has been done to identify emerging technological developments with the potential to meet the care and support needs of the aging population.\nThis review aimed to gain an overview of emerging technologies with potential care and support applications for older people, particularly for those living at home.\nA scoping gray literature review was carried out by using the databases of 13 key organizations, hand searching reference lists of included documents, using funding data, and consulting technology experts. A narrative synthesis approach was used to analyze and summarize the findings of the literature review.\nA total of 39 documents were included in the final analysis. From the analysis, 8 emerging technologies were identified that could potentially be used to meet older people's needs in various care and support domains. These emerging technologies were (1) assistive autonomous robots; (2) self-driving vehicles; (3) artificial intelligence-enabled health smart apps and wearables; (4) new drug release mechanisms; (5) portable diagnostics; (6) voice-activated devices; (7) virtual, augmented, and mixed reality; and (8) intelligent homes. These emerging technologies were at different levels of development, with some being trialed for care applications, whereas others being in the early phases of development. However, only a few documents mentioned including older people during the process of designing and developing these technologies.\nThis review has identified key emerging technologies with the potential to contribute to the support and care needs of older people. However, to increase the adoption of these technologies by older people, there is a need to involve them and other stakeholders, such as formal and informal carers, in the process of designing and developing these technologies.", "Lead (Pb) is a primary toxic heavy metal (HM) which present throughout the entire ecosystem. Some commonly observed challenges in HM (Pb) prediction using artificial intelligence (AI) models include overfitting, normalization, validation against classical AI models, and lack in learning/technology transfer. This study explores the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model as a superior SuperLearning (SL) algorithms for Pb prediction. The proposed model was examined using historical data at the Bramble and Deception Bay (BB and DB) stations, Australia. The model was trained at one of the stations and transferred to a cross-station and vice versa. XGBoost showed higher reliability with less declination in (R2: coefficient of determination), i.e., 0.97 % over the testing phase, among others models at BB. At the cross-station (DB), the performance of the XGBoost model was decreased by 2.74 % (R2) against random forests (RF). The mean absolute error (MAE) observed 40 % (XGBoost) and 47 % (RF) less than artificial neural network (ANN). The XGBoost model performance declined by 3.44 % (R2) over testing (DB), which is minor among validated models. At the cross-station (BB), the XGBoost model showed the least decrement in terms of R2, i.e., 7.99 % against the ANN (8.31 %), RF (10.26 %), and support vector machine (SVM, 36.19 %).", "Researchers expect a high quality of biospecimens/data and value-added services from biobanks. Therefore, the concept of \"biobank 3.0\" was introduced so that biobanks could better meet the needs of stakeholders and maintain sustainable operations. Theoretically, the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) has already gone through the concepts of biobank 1.0 and 2.0. However, three challenges still need to be addressed before it can be transformed into a new generation of the TWB (namely, the TWB 3.0): (1) the difficulty of integrating other biobanks' resources, (2) the efficiency and effectiveness of the release and use of biospecimens/data, and (3) the development of\u00a0income\u00a0and\u00a0revenue\u00a0models of sustainability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework for the TWB 3.0 transformation based on a dual-pillar approach composed of a \"physically\" vertical integration driven by the TWB and a \"virtually\" horizontal network led by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) of Taiwan. Using prominent biobanks such as the Biobanking and BioMolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC), the UK Biobank, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s All of Us Research Program as models, the TWB can strengthen its on-going TWB 2.0 operations in regional and/or international collaboration, increase the value of data collected and develop closer relationships with biobank participants and users. To these ends, the authors highlight key issues that include, but are not limited to, the harmonization of relevant ELSI standards for various biobanks' integrations; the value-added services and the efficiency of Big Data\u00a0Era related research and/or precision medicine development, and financial concerns related to biobank sustainability. This paper concludes by discussing how greater participant engagement and the uptake of Information Technology (IT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications can be used in partnership with vertical and horizontal integration as part of a four-pronged approach to promote biobank sustainability, and facilitate the\u00a0TWB 3.0 transformation.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted polyp detection systems for colonoscopic use are currently attracting attention because they may reduce the possibility of missed adenomas. However, few systems have the necessary regulatory approval for use in clinical practice. We aimed to develop an AI-assisted polyp detection system and to validate its performance using a large colonoscopy video database designed to be publicly accessible.\nTo develop the deep learning-based AI system, 56,668 independent colonoscopy images were obtained from 5 centers for use as training images. To validate the trained AI system, consecutive colonoscopy videos taken at a university hospital between October 2018 and January 2019 were searched to construct a database containing polyps with unbiased variance. All images were annotated by endoscopists according to the presence or absence of polyps and the polyps' locations with bounding boxes.\nA total of 1405 videos acquired during the study period were identified for the validation database, 797 of which contained at least 1 polyp. Of these, 100 videos containing 100 independent polyps and 13 videos negative for polyps were randomly extracted, resulting in 152,560 frames (49,799 positive frames and 102,761 negative frames) for the database. The AI showed 90.5% sensitivity and 93.7% specificity for frame-based analysis. The per-polyp sensitivities for all, diminutive, protruded, and flat polyps were 98.0%, 98.3%, 98.5%, and 97.0%, respectively.\nOur trained AI system was validated with a new large publicly accessible colonoscopy database and could identify colorectal lesions with high sensitivity and specificity. (Clinical trial registration number: UMIN 000037064.).", "Complement is usually seen to largely originate from the liver to accomplish its tasks systemically - its return to the production site has long been underestimated. Recent progress in genomics, therapeutic effects on complement, standardised possibilities in medical laboratory tests and involvement of complosome brings the complement system with its three major functions of opsonization, cytolysis and phagocytosis back to liver biology and pathology. The LOINC\u2122 system features 20 entries for the C3 component of complement to anticipate the application of artificial intelligence data banks algorythms of which are fed with patient-specific data connected to standard lab assays for liver function. These advancements now lead to increased vigilance by clinicians. This reassessment article will further elucidate the distribution of synthesis sites to the three germ layer-derived cell systems and the role complement now known to play in embryogenesis, senescence, allotransplantation and autoimmune disease. This establishes the liver as part of the gastro-intestinal system in connection with nosological entities never thought of, such as the microbiota-liver-brain axis. In neurological disease etiology infectious and autoimmune hepatitis play an important role in the context of causative viz reactive complement activation. The mosaic of autoimmunity, i.e. multiple combinations of the many factors producing varying clinical pictures, leads to the manifold facets of liver autoimmunity.", "Previous studies demonstrated distinct neural correlates underpinning impaired self-regulation (dysregulation) between individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing controls (TDC). However, the impacts of dysregulation on white matter (WM) microstructural property in ASD and TDC remain unclear. Diffusion spectrum imaging was acquired in 59 ASD and 62 TDC boys. We investigated the relationship between participants' dysregulation levels and microstructural property of 76 WM tracts in a multivariate analysis (canonical correlation analysis), across diagnostic groups. A single mode of brain-behavior co-variation was identified: participants were spread along a single axis linking diagnosis, dysregulation, diagnosis-by-dysregulation interaction, and intelligence to a specific WM property pattern. This mode corresponds to diagnosis-distinct correlates underpinning dysregulation, which showed higher generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) associated with less dysregulation in ASD but greater dysregulation in TDC, in the tracts connecting limbic and emotion regulation systems. Moreover, higher GFA of the tracts implicated in memory, attention, sensorimotor processing, and perception associated with less dysregulation in TDC but worse dysregulation in ASD. No shared WM correlates of dysregulation between ASD and TDC were identified. Corresponding to previous studies, we demonstrated that ASD and TDC have broad distinct white matter microstructural property underpinning self-regulation.", "The last decennary has marked as the breakthrough in the advancement of technology with evolution of artificial intelligence, which is rapidly gaining the attention of researchers across the globe. Every field opted artificial intelligence with huge enthusiasm and so the field of dental science is no exception. With huge increases in patient documented information and data this is the need of the hour to use intelligent software to compile and save this data. From the basic step of taking a patient's history to data processing and then to extract the information from the data for diagnosis, artificial intelligence has many applications in dental and medical science. While in no case artificial intelligence can replace the role of a dental surgeon but it is important to be acquainted with the scope to amalgamate this advancement of technology in future for betterment of dental practice.", "The scope and potential of personalised health care are underappreciated and underrealised, often because of resistance to change. The consequence is that many inadequacies of health care in Europe persist unnecessarily, and many opportunities for improvement are neglected. This article identifies the principal challenges, outlines possible approaches to resolving them, and highlights the benefits that could result from greater adoption of personalised health care. It locates the discussion in the context of European policy, focusing particularly on the most recent and authoritative reviews of health care in the EU Member States, and on the newly acquired spirit of readiness and pragmatism among European officials to embrace change and innovative technologies in a new decade. It highlights the attention now being given by policymakers to incentives, innovation, and investment as levers to improve European citizens' prospects in a rapidly evolving world, and how these distinct and disruptive themes contribute to a renaissance in thinking about delivering optimal health care in Europe. It explores the chances offered to patients by specific initiatives in health domains such as cancer and antimicrobial resistance, and by innovative science, novel therapies, earlier diagnosis tools, and deeper understanding of health promotion and prevention. And it reflects on how health care providers could benefit from a shift towards better primary care and towards deploying health data more effectively, including the use of artificial intelligence, coupled with a move to a smoother organisational/regulatory structure and realigned professional responsibilities. The conclusion is that preparing Europe's health care systems for the inevitable strains of the coming years is both possible and necessary. A more courageous approach to embracing personalised health care could guarantee the sustainability of Europe's health care systems before rising demands and exponential costs overwhelm them - an exercise in future-proofing, in ensuring that they are equipped to withstand whatever lies ahead. A focus on the potential and implementation of personalised care would permit more efficient use of resources and deliver better quality health-preserving care.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in medical practice. Especially in the image-based diagnosis of skin cancer, AI shows great potential. However, there is a\u00a0significant discrepancy between expectations and true relevance of AI in current dermatological practice.\nThis article summarizes promising study results of skin cancer diagnosis by computer-based diagnostic systems and discusses their significance for daily practice. We hereby focus on the analysis of dermoscopic images of pigmented and unpigmented skin lesions.\nA\u00a0selective literature search for recent relevant trials was conducted. The included studies used machine learning, and in particular \"convolutional neural networks\", which have been shown to be particularly effective for the classification of image data.\nIn numerous studies, computer algorithms were able to detect pigmented and nonpigmented neoplasms of the skin with high precision, comparable to that of dermatologists. The combination of the physician's assessment and AI showed the best results. Computer-based diagnostic systems are widely accepted among patients and physicians. However, they are still not applicable in daily practice, since computer-based diagnostic systems have only been tested in an experimental environment. In addition, many digital diagnostic criteria that help AI to classify skin lesions remain unclear. This lack of transparency still needs to be addressed. Moreover, clinical studies on the use of AI-based assistance systems are needed in order to prove its applicability in daily dermatologic practice.", "With the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, researchers are striving towards employing these techniques for advancing clinical practice. One of the key objectives in healthcare is the early detection and prediction of disease to timely provide preventive interventions. This is especially the case for epilepsy, which is characterized by recurrent and unpredictable seizures. Patients can be relieved from the adverse consequences of epileptic seizures if it could somehow be predicted in advance. Despite decades of research, seizure prediction remains an unsolved problem. This is likely to remain at least partly because of the inadequate amount of data to resolve the problem. There have been exciting new developments in ML-based algorithms that have the potential to deliver a paradigm shift in the early and accurate prediction of epileptic seizures. Here we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art ML techniques in early prediction of seizures using EEG signals. We will identify the gaps, challenges, and pitfalls in the current research and recommend future directions.", "Technology has always driven advances in radiotherapy treatment. In this review, we describe the main technological advances in radiotherapy over the past decades for the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and highlight some of the pressing issues and challenges that remain. We aim to identify emerging trends in radiation medicine. These include advances in personalized medicine and advanced imaging modalities, standardization of planning and delineation, assessment of treatment response and adaptive re-planning, impact of particle therapy, and role of artificial intelligence or automation in clinical care. In conclusion, we expect significant improvement in the therapeutic ratio of radiotherapy treatment for NPC over the next decade.", "Perspective taking is the ability to take into account what the other agent knows. This skill is not unique to humans as it is also displayed by other animals like chimpanzees. It is an essential ability for social interactions, including efficient cooperation, competition, and communication. Here we present our progress toward building artificial agents with such abilities. We implemented a perspective taking task inspired by experiments done with chimpanzees. We show that agents controlled by artificial neural networks can learn via reinforcement learning to pass simple tests that require some aspects of perspective taking capabilities. We studied whether this ability is more readily learned by agents with information encoded in allocentric or egocentric form for both their visual perception and motor actions. We believe that, in the long run, building artificial agents with perspective taking ability can help us develop artificial intelligence that is more human-like and easier to communicate with.", "When children start formal education, they are expected to be able to express complex thoughts. However, in order to do so, they need to be able to use both complex grammatical structures and a variety of words. One group that is at risk of having a delay in terms of their expressive language ability is children with cochlear implants (CI). In this study, we evaluated whether children with CI perform comparably to children with typical hearing (TH) on a standard expressive spoken grammar and a standard expressive spoken vocabulary task when the groups were matched on non-verbal intelligence and working memory capacity. It was found that the children with CI in this study performed more poorly on a standard expressive spoken vocabulary task but not on a standard expressive spoken grammar task when compared to the children with TH. Differences in terms of expressive spoken vocabulary do not seem to be explained by differences in cognitive ability. In addition, the variation in terms of expressive spoken language ability was larger in the children with CI compared to the children with TH. This might be explained by additional confounding factors, like the time of language deprivation or by a greater influence of cognitive differences for the acquisition of spoken language for children with CI.", "Increasingly, data-driven methods have been implemented to understand psychopathology. Language is the main source of information in psychiatry and represents \"big data\" at the level of the individual. Language and behavior are amenable to computational natural language processing (NLP) analytics, which may help operationalize the mental status examination. In this review, we highlight the application of NLP to schizophrenia and its risk states as an exemplar of its use, operationalizing tangential and concrete speech as reductions in semantic coherence and syntactic complexity, respectively. Other clinical applications are reviewed, including forecasting suicide risk and detecting intoxication. Challenges and future directions are discussed, including biomarker development, harmonization, and application of NLP more broadly to behavior, including intonation/prosody, facial expression and gesture, and the integration of these in dyads and during discourse. Similar NLP analytics can also be applied beyond humans to behavioral motifs across species, important for modeling psychopathology in animal models. Finally, clinical neuroscience can inform the development of artificial intelligence.", "To investigate the utility of the Insight Inventory (a structured clinical inventory completed by caregivers) for assessment of children with cerebral visual impairment; and to investigate effectiveness of tailored habilitational strategies derived from the responses to the Insight Inventory.\nFifty-one eligible children (26 males, 25 females; mean age 9y 5mo, SD 3y, range 5-16y) were recruited from Great Ormond Street Hospital, London. They underwent baseline assessment including neuro-ophthalmological and neuropsychological evaluations, and parent- and child-reported ratings on a questionnaire-based measure of quality of life. Parents also completed the Insight Inventory. On the basis of responses to the Inventory, families received individualized habilitational strategies. Follow-up assessments 6 months later included repeating the Insight Inventory and quality of life questionnaires.\nCorrelations were found between the Insight Inventory and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition, the Beery-Buktenica Test of Visual-Motor Integration, and the Benton Facial Recognition Test, suggesting that the Insight Inventory is an effective tool to estimate visual-perceptual difficulties. At 6 months follow-up, caregiver reports indicated significant improvements in the quality of life of children below the age of 12 years.\nThe Insight Inventory is a simple questionnaire which covers practical aspects of cognitive visual function in everyday life. It provides in-depth information about the aspects that children struggle with. It can also guide programmes of individualized habilitation strategies, which may enhance the quality of life of younger children.\nQuestionnaire scores demonstrate biologically plausible correlations with formal neuropsychological tests of visual function. After administration of matched practical habilitational strategies, younger children showed improvement in quality of life and functional vision scores.", "To understand the varying levels of daily cochlear implant (CI) use in children, previous studies have investigated factors that may be of influence. The objective of this study was to investigate the degree with which new child-related and environment-related characteristics were associated with consistent CI use.\nThe design of this study was retrospective. Data were reviewed of 81 children (51% females, mean age 6.4 years with a range of 1.3 to 17.7 years) who received a CI between 2012 and 2019. Developmental status, quantified burden of comorbidity, hearing experience, and hearing environment were investigated for correlation with consistency in daily CI use. The CIs datalog was used to objectively record the wearing times. Associations were examined using univariate correlation analyses and a linear regression analysis.\nOn average, the CI was worn 8.6\u2009hr per day and 59% of the children wore it more than 8\u2009hr daily. The latter children's hearing performance was significantly higher than that of the others. Consistency in CI use correlated significantly with the child-related characteristics chronological age, nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class, pre CI acoustic experience, CI experience, and one of the environment related characteristics \"parental communication mode.\" In a multivariate linear regression model, consistency in CI use was significantly dependent on nonverbal IQ and parental communication mode. These together accounted for 47% of the variation in daily CI use.\nThe findings indicate that children with lower nonverbal IQ scores and low exposure to oral communication by their parents are at risk of inconsistent CI use.", "The miss rate of flat advanced colorectal neoplasia is still unacceptably high, especially in the Western setting, notwithstanding the widespread implementation of quality improvement programs and training. It is well known that flat morphology is associated with miss rate of colorectal neoplasia, and that this subset of lesions often shows a more aggressive biological behaviour. Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to the detection of colorectal neoplasia has been shown to increase adenoma detection rate, consistently across all lesion sizes and locations in the colon. However, there is still uncertainty whether AI can reduce the miss rate of flat advanced neoplasia, mainly because all published trials report a low number of flat colorectal lesions in their training sets, and this could reduce AI accuracy for this subset of lesions. In addition, flat lesions have different morphologies with variable prevalence and potentially different accuracy in their detection. For example, the subtle appearance and rarer frequency of a non-granular laterally spreading tumor (LST) could be much harder to identify than a granular mixed LST. In this review, we present a summary of the evidence on the role of AI in the identification of colorectal flat neoplasia, with a focus on data regarding presence of LSTs in the training/validation sets of the AI systems currently available on the market.", "Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent advances in lung cancer screening, radiotherapy, surgical techniques, and systemic therapy have led to increasing complexity in diagnosis, treatment decision-making, and assessment of recurrence. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models are being developed to address these issues and may have a future role in screening, diagnosis, treatment selection, and decision-making around salvage therapy. Imaging plays an essential role in all components of lung cancer management and has the potential to play a key role in AI applications. Artificial intelligence has demonstrated value in prognostic biomarker discovery in lung cancer diagnosis, treatment, and response assessment, putting it at the forefront of the next phase of personalized medicine. However, although exploratory studies demonstrate potential utility, there is a need for rigorous validation and standardization before AI can be utilized in clinical decision-making. In this review, we will provide a summary of the current literature implementing AI for outcome prediction in lung cancer. We will describe the anticipated impact of AI on the management of patients with lung cancer and discuss the challenges of clinical implementation of these techniques.", "The objective of this technical study was to evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system for clinical trials matching for a cohort of lung cancer patients in an Australian cancer hospital.\nA lung cancer cohort was derived from clinical data from patients attending an Australian cancer hospital. Ten phases I-III clinical trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov and open to lung cancer patients at this institution were utilized for assessments. The trial matching system performance was compared to a gold standard established by clinician consensus for trial eligibility.\nThe study included 102 lung cancer patients. The trial matching system evaluated 7252 patient attributes (per patient median 74, range 53-100) against 11\u2009467 individual trial eligibility criteria (per trial median 597, range 243-4132). Median time for the system to run a query and return results was 15.5\u2009s (range 7.2-37.8). In establishing the gold standard, clinician interrater agreement was high (Cohen's kappa 0.70-1.00). On a per-patient basis, the performance of the trial matching system for eligibility was as follows: accuracy, 91.6%; recall (sensitivity), 83.3%; precision (positive predictive value), 76.5%; negative predictive value, 95.7%; and specificity, 93.8%.\nThe AI-based clinical trial matching system allows efficient and reliable screening of cancer patients for clinical trials with 95.7% accuracy for exclusion and 91.6% accuracy for overall eligibility assessment; however, clinician input and oversight are still required. The automated system demonstrates promise as a clinical decision support tool to prescreen a large patient cohort to identify subjects suitable for further assessment.", "Despite decades of speculation, many causal aspects that contribute to the heterogeneity of alexithymia still must be clarified. This study examined the extent of the alexithymia phenotype and its contribution to social function in the general population. In total, 200 participants (females = 111) completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), multiple self-reporting questionnaires measuring emotion intelligence, empathy, hostility and impulsivity, and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). In the multivariate analysis, highly alexithymic individuals appeared to report subjective deficits in emotion recognition and regulation as well as increased impulsivity; however, their empathy skills were intact, and even the proneness to experiencing empathic distress with others' suffering was increased among alexithymic individuals. We also compared the clinical and behavioral manifestations of highly alexithymic male and female subjects to those of each gender control group. As a result, in contrast to their subjective self-reports of emotion processing impairment, the RMET performance appeared to be preserved in alexithymic females; however, highly alexithymic males showed actual deficits in the emotion identification task. Future research needs to further refine the constructs of alexithymia to incorporate the phenotypic changes in affected individuals in relation to measuring instruments, the extent of empathic distress, and gender.", "Increasing evidence has shown that intelligence quotient (IQ) depends not only on the aspect of phenomenology such as the size of brain and sexuality but also on the topology of the brain network. We here try to get a deeper understanding by asking how the running mode of the brain network influences IQ. We introduce a parameter \u03b1 to represent the trade-off between wiring cost and processing efficiency and figure out the optimal value of \u03b1 by the approach of network reconstruction. A negative correlation between optimal index \u03b1 and IQ is revealed. To further find out the mechanism for the functional difference between males and females, we move to the local level of brain regions and study the relationship between regional optimal \u03b1 and IQ. We find that the Pearson coefficients of males are significantly different from that of females, including both global and regional levels. These findings show that the functional differences between individuals, including the differences between males and females, are closely related to the different running modes of their brain networks.", "A vast quantity of real-world data (RWD) are available to healthcare researchers. Such data come from diverse sources such as electronic health records, insurance claims and billing activity, product and disease registries, medical devices used in the home, and applications on mobile devices. The analysis of RWD produces real-world evidence (RWE), which is clinical evidence that provides information about usage and potential benefits or risks of a drug. This review defines and explains RWD, and it also details how regulatory authorities are using RWD and RWE. The main challenges in harnessing RWD include collating and analyzing numerous disparate types or categories of available information including both structured (eg, field entries) and unstructured (eg, doctor notes, discharge summaries, social media posts) data. Although the use of artificial intelligence to capture, amalgamate, standardize, and analyze RWD is still evolving, it has the potential to support the increased use of RWE to improve global health and healthcare.", "This article aims to discusses machine learning modelling using a dataset provided by the LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory) earthquake prediction competition hosted by Kaggle. The data were obtained from a laboratory stick-slip friction experiment that mimics real earthquakes. Digitized acoustic signals were recorded against time to failure of a granular layer compressed between steel plates. In this work, machine learning was employed to develop models that could predict earthquakes. The aim is to highlight the importance and potential applicability of machine learning in seismology The XGBoost algorithm was used for modelling combined with 6-fold cross-validation and the mean absolute error (MAE) metric for model quality estimation. The backward feature elimination technique was used followed by the forward feature construction approach to find the best combination of features. The advantage of this feature engineering method is that it enables the best subset to be found from a relatively large set of features in a relatively short time. It was confirmed that the proper combination of statistical characteristics describing acoustic data can be used for effective prediction of time to failure. Additionally, statistical features based on the autocorrelation of acoustic data can also be used for further improvement of model quality. A total of 48 statistical features were considered. The best subset was determined as having 10 features. Its corresponding MAE was 1.913 s, which was stable to the third decimal point. The presented results can be used to develop artificial intelligence algorithms devoted to earthquake prediction.", "With the development of healthcare 4.0, there has been an explosion in the amount of data such as image, medical text, physiological signals, lab tests, etc. Among them, medical records provide a complete picture of the associated clinical events. However, the processing of medical texts is difficult because they are structurally free, diverse in style, and have subjective factors. Assigning metadata codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) presents a standardized way of indicating diagnoses and procedures, so it becomes a mandatory process for understanding medical records to make better clinical and financial decisions. Such a manual encoding task is time-consuming, error-prone and expensive. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning approach and a medical topic mining method to automatically predict ICD codes from text-free medical records. The result of the F1 score on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset increases by 5% over the state of art. It also suitable for multiple ICD versions and languages. For the specific disease, atrial fibrillation, the F1 score is up to 96% and 93.3% using in-house ICD-10 datasets and MIMIC-III datasets, respectively. We developed an Artificial Intelligence based coding system, which can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of human coders, and meanwhile accelerate the secondary use for clinical informatics.", "The data-driven approach to sustainable urban development is becoming increasingly popular among the cities across the world. This is due to cities' attention in supporting smart and sustainable urbanism practices. In an era of digitalization of urban services and processes, which is upon us, platform urbanism is becoming a fundamental tool to support smart urban governance, and helping in the formation of a new version of cities-i.e., City 4.0. This new version utilizes urban dashboards and platforms in its operations and management tasks of its complex urban metabolism. These intelligent systems help in maintaining the robustness of our cities, integrating various sensors (e.g., internet-of-things) and big data analysis technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence) with the aim of optimizing urban infrastructures and services (e.g., water, waste, energy), and turning the urban system into a smart one. The study generates insights from the sensor city best practices by placing some of renowned projects, implemented by Huawei, Cisco, Google, Ericsson, Microsoft, and Alibaba, under the microscope. The investigation findings reveal that the sensor city approach: (a) Has the potential to increase the smartness and sustainability level of cities; (b) Manages to engage citizens and companies in the process of planning, monitoring and analyzing urban processes; (c) Raises awareness on the local environmental, social and economic issues, and; (d) Provides a novel city blueprint for urban administrators, managers and planners. Nonetheless, the use of advanced technologies-e.g., real-time monitoring stations, cloud computing, surveillance cameras-poses a multitude of challenges related to: (a) Quality of the data used; (b) Level of protection of traditional and cybernetic urban security; (c) Necessary integration between the various urban infrastructure, and; (d) Ability to transform feedback from stakeholders into innovative urban policies.", "The number of measles cases declined in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom in 2020. Reported cases to The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control decreased from 710 to 54 between January and May. Epidemic intelligence screening observed a similar trend. Under-diagnoses and under-reporting during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic should be ruled out before concluding reduced measles circulation is because of social distancing and any community control measures taken to control COVID-19.", "Guidelines suggest computed tomography colonography (CTC) following incomplete optical colonoscopy (OC). Colon capsule endoscopies (CCE) have been suggested as an alternative, although completion rates have been unsatisfactory. Introduction of artificial intelligence (AI)-based localization algorithms of the camera capsules may enable identification of incomplete CCE investigations overlapping with incomplete OCs.\nThe study aims to investigate relative sensitivity of CCE compared with CTC following incomplete OC, investigate the completion rate when combining results from the incomplete OC and CCE, and develop a forward-tracking algorithm ensuring a safe completeness of combined investigations.\nIn this prospective paired study, patients with indication for CTC following incomplete OC were included for CCE and CTC. Location of CCE abortion and OC abortion were registered to identify complete combined investigations. AI-based algorithm for localization of capsules were developed reconstructing the passage of the colon.\nIn 237 individuals with CTC indication; 105 were included, of which 97 underwent both a CCE and CTC. CCE was complete in 66 (68%). Including CCEs which reached most oral point of incomplete OC, 73 (75%) had complete colonic investigations; 78 (80%) had conclusive investigations. Relative sensitivity of CCE compared with CTC was 2.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.76;4.04) for polyps >5 mm and 1.91 (95% CI 1.18;3.09) for polyps >9 mm. An AI-based algorithm was developed.\nSensitivity of CCE following incomplete OC was superior to CTC. Introducing and improving algorithm-based localization of capsule abortion may increase identification of overall complete investigation rates following incomplete OC.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02826993.", "Prior research indicates that deficits in emotional abilities are key predictors of the onset and maintenance of eating disorders (ED). As a relatively new emotion-related construct, emotional intelligence (EI) comprises a set of basic emotional abilities. Preliminary research suggests that deficits in EI are linked with disordered eating and other impulsive behaviours. Also, previous research reveals that emotional and socio-cognitive abilities, as well as ED symptomatology, varies across lifespan development. However, while the findings suggest promising results for the development of potential effective treatments for emotional deficits and disordered eating, it is difficult to summarise the relationship between EI and ED due to the diversity of theoretical approaches and variety of EI and ED measures.\nOur study, therefore, aimed to systematically review the current evidence on EI and ED in both the general and clinical populations and across different developmental stages.\nThe databases examined were Medline, PsycInfo and Scopus, and 15 eligible articles were identified. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used.\nAll the studies reviewed indicated negative associations between EI and the dimensions of ED. Additionally, several mechanisms involved, namely adaptability, stress tolerance and emotional regulation were highlighted.\nThe systematic review suggests promising but challenging preliminary evidence of the associations between EI and the dimensions of ED across diverse stages of development. In addition, future research, practical implications and limitations are discussed.\nSystematic review.", "Previous research has shown that bilingual children outperform monolinguals on tasks testing cognitive control. Bilinguals' enhanced cognitive control is thought to be caused by the necessity to exert more language control in bilingual compared to monolingual settings. Surprisingly, between-group research of cognitive effects of bilingualism is hardly ever combined with within-group research that investigates relationships between language control and cognitive control. The present study compared 27 monolingual Dutch and 27 bilingual Turkish-Dutch children matched on age and fluid intelligence on their performance in a nonverbal switching task. Within the group of bilinguals, the relationship between nonverbal switching and language switching was examined. The results revealed no between-group differences on nonverbal switching. Within the bilingual sample, response times in the language switching and nonverbal switching tasks were related, although no relationships were found between accuracy, switching cost and mixing cost on both tasks. The results support the hypothesis that children utilize domain-general cognitive control in language switching, but this relationship does not entail that bilinguals have better cognitive control than monolinguals.", "The purpose of the study was to explore the impact of timing and test specificity of cognitive outcome measures after pediatric epilepsy surgery.\nA consecutive national cohort of 114 children with medically resistant epilepsy having had resective epilepsy surgery were screened for children tested with a complete age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence test at two or three time-points. This provided 43 children for analyses. Composite subscale scores were assessed in comparison to index and intelligence quotient (IQ) scores.\nWe found a main effect of time in seizure-free children for full-scale IQ (FSIQ); F(2, 42)\u202f=\u202f6.49 with higher T2 measures compared with T1 (MDiff\u202f=\u202f5.46, p\u202f=\u202f.006). There was a difference in FSIQ scores between seizure-free and nonseizure-free children at T2; M\u202f=\u202f7.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.05 to 14.57], t(38)\u202f=\u202f2.04, p\u202f=\u202f.049, favoring seizure-free children. A statistical difference between composite scale scores and index scores was found with medium to large effect. The correlation of medical treatment (anti-epileptic drug (AED)) change and score differences in FSIQ outcome was significant (p\u202f=\u202f.041), with less AED correlated with a higher FSIQ. All children with left-temporal surgery had a stable or improved verbal comprehension composite subscale score outcome at T2 regardless of seizure status.\nOur results correspond to some longitudinal studies with outcome measures >2\u202fyears, in contrast to short-term studies \u22642\u202fyears with a stable outcome. Our study supports the fact that the specificity of the used tests and the timing of assessments after pediatric epilepsy surgery are essential factors for the clinical validity of outcome measures. However, there are further needs of extensive longitudinal studies to provide a better understanding of life-long cognitive development and impact after childhood epilepsy surgery.", "Capsule endoscopy (CE) is the first-line diagnostic modality for detecting small bowel lesions. CE is non-invasive and does not require sedation, but its movements cannot be controlled, it requires a long time for interpretation, and it has lower image quality compared to wired endoscopy. With the rapid advancement of technology, several methods to solve these problems have been developed. This article describes the ongoing developments regarding external CE locomotion using magnetic force, artificial intelligence-based interpretation, and image-enhancing technologies with the CE system.", "In recent years, processing of the imaging signal derived from CT, MR or positron emission has proven to be able to predict outcome parameters in cancer patients. The processing techniques of the signal constitute the discipline of radiomics. The quantitative analysis of medical images outperform the information that can be obtained through traditional visual analysis. The recognition of neoplasm molecular and genetic characteristics in a non-invasive way, based on routine radiological examinations, potentially allow complete tumor profiling and subsequent treatment customization at practically zero costs. This process is further boosted with the availability of increased computing power and development of artificial intelligence approaches.", "This paper explores the predictive capability of dynamic functional connectivity extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human brain, in contrast to static connectivity used in past research.\nSeveral state-of-the-art features extracted from static functional connectivity of the brain are employed to predict biological gender and intelligence using publicly available Human Connectome Project (HCP) database. Next, a novel tensor parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition model is proposed to decompose sequence of dynamic connectivity matrices into common connectivity components that are orthonormal to each other, common time-courses, and corresponding distinct subject-wise weights. The subject-wise loading of the components are employed to predict biological gender and intelligence using a random forest classifier (respectively, regressor) using 5-fold cross-validation.\nThe results demonstrate that dynamic functional connectivity can indeed classify biological gender with a high accuracy (0.94, where male identification accuracy was 0.87 and female identification accuracy was 0.97). It can also predict intelligence with less normalized mean square error (0.139 for fluid intelligence and 0.031 for fluid ability metrics) compared with other functional connectivity measures (the nearest mean square error were 0.147 and 0.037 for fluid intelligence and fluid ability metrics, respectively, using static connectivity approaches).\nOur work is an important milestone for the understanding of non-stationary behavior of hemodynamic blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in brain and how they are associated with biological gender and intelligence.\nThe paper demonstrates that dynamic behavior of brain can contribute substantially towards forming a fingerprint of biological gender and intelligence.", "Music training has repeatedly been claimed to positively impact children's cognitive skills and academic achievement (literacy and mathematics). This claim relies on the assumption that engaging in intellectually demanding activities fosters particular domain-general cognitive skills, or even general intelligence. The present meta-analytic review (N = 6,984, k = 254, m = 54) shows that this belief is incorrect. Once the quality of study design is controlled for, the overall effect of music training programs is null ([Formula: see text] \u2248 0) and highly consistent across studies (\u03c42 \u2248 0). Results of Bayesian analyses employing distributional assumptions (informative priors) derived from previous research in cognitive training corroborate these conclusions. Small statistically significant overall effects are obtained only in those studies implementing no random allocation of participants and employing non-active controls ([Formula: see text] \u2248 0.200, p < .001). Interestingly, music training is ineffective regardless of the type of outcome measure (e.g., verbal, non-verbal, speed-related, etc.), participants' age, and duration of training. Furthermore, we note that, beyond meta-analysis of experimental studies, a considerable amount of cross-sectional evidence indicates that engagement in music has no impact on people's non-music cognitive skills or academic achievement. We conclude that researchers' optimism about the benefits of music training is empirically unjustified and stems from misinterpretation of the empirical data and, possibly, confirmation bias.", "Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a severe, heterogeneous disorder of methylmalonate and cobalamin (cbl; vitamin B12) metabolism with a poor prognosis that can cause brain damage. Identifying the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of MMA might help to make accurate diagnoses earlier in the disease course and exploring the relationship between neuropsychological scores and MRI findings, when therapy is more effective and to improve therapeutic efficacy. Cerebral MRI studies from 37 children with MMA were evaluated by a neuroradiologist. Clinical and imaging data were collected from each patient. All tests were performed during routine investigations and in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from the guardians of all patients for inclusion in the study. The most common and significant findings were periventricular white matter changes (78.4%), ventricular dilation (29.7%) and cerebral atrophy (40.5%). According to the developmental quotient, the 37 patients were divided into the normal intelligence subgroup (NI, developmental quotient\u2009\u2265\u200985) and the low intelligence subgroup (LI, developmental quotient\u2009<\u200985). The incidence of corpus callosal thinning, cortical atrophy, subcortical white matter changes, and ventricular dilation (grades 0-3) was significantly higher in the LI subgroup than in the NI subgroup (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The incidence of no-mild and moderate-severe ventricular dilation was significantly higher in the LI subgroup than in the NI subgroup (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Ventricular dilatation, cerebral atrophy, white matter changes, and corpus callosal thinning are the main MRI abnormalities in MMA patients, and these manifestations are significantly correlated with delayed development in children.", "Since 2017, there have been several reports of artificial intelligence (AI) achieving comparable performance to human experts on medical image analysis tasks. With the first ratification of a\u00a0computer vision algorithm as a\u00a0medical device in 2018, the way was paved for these methods to eventually become an integral part of modern clinical practice.\nThe purpose of this article is to review the main developments that have occurred over the last few years in AI for image analysis, in relation to clinical applications and dermatology.\nFollowing the annual ImageNet challenge, we review classical methods of machine learning for image analysis and demonstrate how these methods incorporated human expertise but failed to meet industrial requirements regarding performance and scalability. With the rise of deep learning based on artificial neural networks, these limitations could be overcome. We discuss important aspects of this technology including transfer learning and report on recent developments such as explainable AI and generative models.\nDeep learning models achieved performance on a\u00a0par with human experts in a\u00a0broad variety of diagnostic tasks and were shown to be suitable for industrialization. Therefore, current developments focus less on further improving accuracy but rather address open issues such as interpretability and applicability under clinical conditions. Upcoming generative models allow for entirely new applications.\nDeep learning has a\u00a0history of remarkable success and has become the new technical standard for image analysis. The dramatic improvement these models brought over classical approaches enables applications in a\u00a0rapidly increasing number of clinical fields. In dermatology, as in many other domains, artificial intelligence still faces considerable challenges but is undoubtedly developing into an essential tool of modern medicine.", "COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic and become the most urgent threat to the entire world. Tremendous efforts and resources have been invested in developing diagnosis, prognosis and treatment strategies to combat the disease. Although nucleic acid detection has been mainly used as the gold standard to confirm this RNA virus-based disease, it has been shown that such a strategy has a high false negative rate, especially for patients in the early stage, and thus CT imaging has been applied as a major diagnostic modality in confirming positive COVID-19. Despite the various, urgent advances in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided systems for CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis, most of the existing methods can only perform classification, whereas the state-of-the-art segmentation method requires a high level of human intervention. In this paper, we propose a fully-automatic, rapid, accurate, and machine-agnostic method that can segment and quantify the infection regions on CT scans from different sources. Our method is founded upon two innovations: 1) the first CT scan simulator for COVID-19, by fitting the dynamic change of real patients' data measured at different time points, which greatly alleviates the data scarcity issue; and 2) a novel deep learning algorithm to solve the large-scene-small-object problem, which decomposes the 3D segmentation problem into three 2D ones, and thus reduces the model complexity by an order of magnitude and, at the same time, significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results over multi-country, multi-hospital, and multi-machine datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the existing ones and suggest its important application value in combating the disease.", "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been a focus of medical research for decades, in the last decade, the field of radiology has seen tremendous innovation and also public focus due to development and application of machine-learning techniques to develop new algorithms. Interestingly, this innovation is driven simultaneously by academia, existing global medical device vendors, and-fueled by venture capital-recently founded startups. Radiologists find themselves once again in the position to lead this innovation to improve clinical workflows and ultimately patient outcome. However, although the end of today's radiologists' profession has been proclaimed multiple times, routine clinical application of such AI algorithms in 2020 remains rare. The goal of this review article is to describe in detail the relevance of appropriate imaging data as a bottleneck for innovation, provide insights into the many obstacles for technical implementation, and give additional perspectives to radiologists who often view AI solely from their clinical role. As regulatory approval processes for such medical devices are currently under public discussion and the relevance of imaging data is transforming, radiologists need to establish themselves as the leading gatekeepers for evolution of their field and be aware of the many stakeholders and sometimes conflicting interests.", "The 2D semiconductor indium selenide (InSe) has attracted significant interest due its unique electronic band structure, high electron mobility, and wide tunability of its band gap energy achieved by varying the layer thickness. All these features make 2D InSe a potential candidate for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications. Here, the discovery of new polymorphs of InSe with enhanced electronic properties is reported. Using a global structure search that combines artificial swarm intelligence with first-principles energetic calculations, polymorphs that consist of a centrosymmetric monolayer belonging to the point group D 3d are identified, distinct from well-known polymorphs based on the D 3h monolayers that lack inversion symmetry. The new polymorphs are thermodynamically and kinetically stable, and exhibit a wider optical spectral response and larger electron mobilities compared to the known polymorphs. Opportunities to synthesize these newly discovered polymorphs and viable routes to identify them by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation experiments are discussed.", "Spray drying is commonly used to produce amorphous solid dispersions (ASD) to improve the bioperformance of poorly water-soluble drugs. In this study, imaging techniques such as focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and X-ray microcomputed tomography (XRCT) were used to study the microstructure of spray dried (SD) particles. Spray drying at higher outlet temperature (Tout) was found to produce more spherical hollow particles with smooth surface and thinner walls, while more raisin-like particles with thicker walls were generated at lower Tout. For the first time, an artificial intelligence-facilitated XRCT image analysis tool was developed to make quantitative analysis of thousands of particles individually possible. The particle size distribution through XRCT image analysis is generally in line with what is measured by laser diffraction. The image analysis reveals envelope density as a more sensitive physical attribute for process change than conventional bulk/tap density. Further, the tensile strength of SD particle compacts correlates with the particle wall thickness, and this is likely caused by the larger interparticle contact area generated by more deformation of particles with thinner walls. The knowledge gained here can help enable SD particle engineering and drug product with more robust process and optimized performance.", "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in ophthalmology has increased dramatically. However, interpretation of these studies can be a daunting prospect for the ophthalmologist without a background in computer or data science. This review aims to share some practical considerations for interpretation of AI studies in ophthalmology.\nIt can be easy to get lost in the technical details of studies involving AI. Nevertheless, it is important for clinicians to remember that the fundamental questions in interpreting these studies remain unchanged - What does this study show, and how does this affect my patients? Being guided by familiar principles like study purpose, impact, validity, and generalizability, these studies become more accessible to the ophthalmologist. Although it may not be necessary for nondomain experts to understand the exact AI technical details, we explain some broad concepts in relation to AI technical architecture and dataset management.\nThe expansion of AI into healthcare and ophthalmology is here to stay. AI systems have made the transition from bench to bedside, and are already being applied to patient care. In this context, 'AI education' is crucial for ophthalmologists to be confident in interpretation and translation of new developments in this field to their own clinical practice.", "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically devastating diseases affecting the pork industry globally. PRRS is caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV). Currently there are no effective treatments against this swine disease.\nThrough artificial intelligence molecular screening, we obtained a set of small molecule compounds predicted to target the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 5 (SRCR5) of CD163, which is a cell surface receptor specific for PRRSV infection. These compounds were screened using a cell-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, and the function of positive hit was further evaluated and validated by PRRSV-infection assay using porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs).\nUsing\u00a0the BiFC assay, we identified one compound with previously unverified function, 4-Fluoro-2-methyl-N-[3-(3-morpholin-4-ylsulfonylanilino)quinoxalin-2-yl]benzenesulfonamide (designated here as B7), that significantly inhibits the interaction between the PRRSV glycoprotein (GP2a or GP4) and the CD163-SRCR5 domain. We further demonstrated that compound B7 inhibits PRRSV infection of PAMs, the primary target of PRRSV in a dose-dependent manner. B7 significantly inhibited the infection caused by both type I and type II PRRSV strains. Further comparison and functional evaluation of chemical compounds structurally related to B7 revealed that the 3-(morpholinosulfonyl)aniline moiety of B7 or the 3-(piperidinylsulfonyl)aniline moiety in a B7 analogue is important for the inhibitory function against PRRSV infection.\nOur study identified a novel strategy to potentially prevent PRRSV infection in pigs by blocking the PRRSV-CD163 interaction with small molecules.", "The milling process is a complex phenomenon dependent on various technological and material parameters. The development of a fluidized bed jet milling model is of high practical significance, since milling is utilized in many industries, and its complexity is still not sufficiently recognized. Therefore, this research aims to optimize fluidized bed jet milling with the use of fuzzy logic (FL) based approach as one of the primary artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The developed fuzzy logic model (FLMill) of the investigated process allows it to be described as a non-iterative procedure, over a wide range of operating conditions. Working air pressure, rotational speed of the classifier rotor, and time of conducting the test are considered as inputs, while mass and mean Sauter diameter of the product are defined as outputs. Several triangular and constant linguistic terms are used in the developed FLMill model, which was validated against the experimental data. The optimum working air pressure and the test's conducting time are 500 kPa and 3000 s, respectively. The optimum rotational speed of the classifier is equal to 50 s-1, considering the mass of the grinding product, and 250 s-1 for the mean Sauter diameter of the product. Such operating parameters allow obtaining 243.3 g of grinding product with the mean Sauter diameter of 11 \u00b5m. The research proved that the use of fuzzy logic modeling as a computer-based technique of solving mechanical engineering problems allows effective optimization of the fluidized bed jet milling process.", "The predictive processing framework (PPF) attempts to tackle deep philosophical problems, including how the brain generates consciousness, how our bodies influence cognition, and how cognition alters perception. As such, it provides a zeitgeist that incorporates concepts from physics, computer science, mathematics, artificial intelligence, economics, psychology, and neuroscience, leveraging and, in turn, influencing recent advances in reinforcement learning and deep learning that underpin the artificial intelligence in many of the applications with which we interact daily. PPF purports to provide no less than a grand unifying theory of mind and brain function, underwriting an account of perception, cognition, and action and their dynamic relationships. While mindful of legitimate criticisms of the framework, to which we return below, an important test of PPF is its utility in accounting for individual differences such as psychopathology. These, then, are the central concern of this special section of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology: What is the state of the art with regards to applying the PPF to the symptoms of mental illness? How might we leverage its insights to elevate and systematize our explanations, and ideally treatments, of those symptoms? And, conversely, can we refine and refute aspects of the PPF by considering the particular challenges that our patients experience as departures from the parametric estimates of the PPF? (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).", "Acute critical illness is often preceded by deterioration of routinely measured clinical parameters, e.g., blood pressure and heart rate. Early clinical prediction is typically based on manually calculated screening metrics that simply weigh these parameters, such as early warning scores (EWS). The predictive performance of EWSs yields a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity that can lead to negative outcomes for the patient. Previous work on electronic health records (EHR) trained artificial intelligence (AI) systems offers promising results with high levels of predictive performance in relation to the early, real-time prediction of acute critical illness. However, without insight into the complex decisions by such system, clinical translation is hindered. Here, we present an explainable AI early warning score (xAI-EWS) system for early detection of acute critical illness. xAI-EWS potentiates clinical translation by accompanying a prediction with information on the EHR data explaining it.", "New biomarkers of early and late graft dysfunction are needed in renal transplant to improve management of complications and prolong graft survival. A wide range of potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, measured in different biological fluids (serum, plasma, urine) and in renal tissues, have been proposed for post-transplant delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR), and chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD). This review investigates old and new potential biomarkers for each of these clinical domains, seeking to underline their limits and strengths. OMICs technology has allowed identifying many candidate biomarkers, providing diagnostic and prognostic information at very early stages of pathological processes, such as AR. Donor-derived cell-free DNA (ddcfDNA) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are further promising tools. Although most of these biomarkers still need to be validated in multiple independent cohorts and standardized, they are paving the way for substantial advances, such as the possibility of accurately predicting risk of DGF before graft is implanted, of making a \"molecular\" diagnosis of subclinical rejection even before histological lesions develop, or of dissecting etiology of CAD. Identification of \"immunoquiescent\" or even tolerant patients to guide minimization of immunosuppressive therapy is another area of active research. The parallel progress in imaging techniques, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence (AI) is helping to fully exploit the wealth of information provided by biomarkers, leading to improved disease nosology of old entities such as transplant glomerulopathy. Prospective studies are needed to assess whether introduction of these new sets of biomarkers into clinical practice could actually reduce the need for renal biopsy, integrate traditional tools, and ultimately improve graft survival compared to current management.", "Intellectually disabled persons, as compared with normal people, experience different changes during the adolescence period including the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics. However, owing to their low intelligence quotient, these changes are usually accompanied by more problems and challenges. The present study was conducted to determine the experiences of parents regarding the sexual and reproductive health of educable intellectually disabled adolescent girls.\nThis qualitative study was carried out on 52 participants (adolescent girls, parents, teachers, healthcare providers, and managers) who were selected via purposeful sampling in Isfahan between July 2016 and April 2017. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and field notes, and analyzed using conventional content analysis.\nFive sub-categories were extracted: \"unawareness about sexual needs of the adolescent girl and her potential vulnerability,\" \"inappropriate actions in directing the sexual behaviors of the adolescent,\" \"insufficient supervision and care over the adolescent's sexual health,\" \"inappropriate actions toward marrying off the adolescent,\" and \"inappropriate actions regarding the menstrual and genital health\" which formed the main category of \"parents' inefficiency in maintaining adolescent girls' sexual and reproductive health.\"\nBased on the results, parents face different challenges about the sexual and reproductive health of intellectually disabled adolescent girls. Hence, empowering the parents especially mothers through teachers and healthcare providers with the knowledge and skills to maintain the sexual and reproductive health of intellectually disabled adolescent girls would make them emboldened to find the ability to protect themselves in different situations.", "To evaluate the clinical pictures, laboratory tests and imaging of patients with lung involvement, either from severe COVID-19 or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), in order to assess how similar these two diseases are.\nThe present work has been designed as a cross-sectional single-centre study to compare characteristics of patients with lung involvement either from MAS or severe COVID-19. Chest CT scans were assessed by using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based software.\nTen patients with MAS and 47 patients with severe COVID-19 with lung involvement were assessed. Although all patients showed fever and dyspnoea, patients with MAS were characterised by thrombocytopaenia, whereas patients with severe COVID-19 were characterised by lymphopaenia and neutrophilia. Higher values of H-score characterised patients with MAS when compared with severe COVID-19. AI-reconstructed images of chest CT scan showed that apical, basal, peripheral and bilateral distributions of ground-glass opacities (GGOs), as well as apical consolidations, were more represented in severe COVID-19 than in MAS. C reactive protein directly correlated with GGOs extension in both diseases. Furthermore, lymphopaenia inversely correlated with GGOs extension in severe COVID-19.\nOur data could suggest laboratory and radiological differences between MAS and severe COVID-19, paving the way for further hypotheses to be investigated in future confirmatory studies.", "BACKGROUND. Potential approaches for abbreviated knee MRI, including prospective acceleration with deep learning, have achieved limited clinical implementation. OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to evaluate the interreader agreement between conventional knee MRI and a 5-minute 3D quantitative double-echo steady-state (qDESS) sequence with automatic T2 mapping and deep learning super-resolutionaugmentation and to compare the diagnostic performance of the two methods regarding findings from arthroscopic surgery. METHODS. Fifty-one patients with knee pain underwent knee MRI that included an additional 3D qDESS sequence with automatic T2 mapping. Fourier interpolation was followed by prospective deep learning super resolution to enhance qDESS slice resolution twofold. A musculoskeletal radiologist and a radiology resident performed independent retrospective evaluations of articular cartilage, menisci, ligaments, bones, extensor mechanism, and synovium using conventional MRI. Following a 2-month washout period, readers reviewed qDESS images alone followed by qDESS with the automatic T2 maps. Interreader agreement between conventional MRI and qDESS was computed using percentage agreement and Cohen kappa. The sensitivity and specificity of conventional MRI, qDESS alone, and qDESS plus T2 mapping were compared with arthroscopic findings using exact McNemar tests. RESULTS. Conventional MRI and qDESS showed 92% agreement in evaluating all tissues. Kappa was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.81) across all imaging findings. In 43 patients who underwent arthroscopy, sensitivity and specificity were not significantly different (p = .23 to > .99) between conventional MRI (sensitivity, 58-93%; specificity, 27-87%) and qDESS alone (sensitivity, 54-90%; specificity, 23-91%) for cartilage, menisci, ligaments, and synovium. For grade 1 cartilage lesions, sensitivity and specificity were 33% and 56%, respectively, for conventional MRI; 23% and 53% for qDESS (p = .81); and 46% and 39% for qDESS with T2 mapping (p = .80). For grade 2A lesions, values were 27% and 53% for conventional MRI, 26% and 52% for qDESS (p = .02), and 58% and 40% for qDESS with T2 mapping (p < .001). CONCLUSION. The qDESS method prospectively augmented with deep learning showed strong interreader agreement with conventional knee MRI and near-equivalent diagnostic performance regarding arthroscopy. The ability of qDESS to automatically generate T2 maps increases sensitivity for cartilage abnormalities. CLINICAL IMPACT. Using prospective artificial intelligence to enhance qDESS image quality may facilitate an abbreviated knee MRI protocol while generating quantitative T2 maps.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is about to transform medical imaging. The Research Consortium for Medical Image Analysis (RECOMIA), a not-for-profit organisation, has developed an online platform to facilitate collaboration between medical researchers and AI researchers. The aim is to minimise the time and effort researchers need to spend on technical aspects, such as transfer, display, and annotation of images, as well as legal aspects, such as de-identification. The purpose of this article is to present the RECOMIA platform and its AI-based tools for organ segmentation in computed tomography (CT), which can be used for extraction of standardised uptake values from the corresponding positron emission tomography (PET) image.\nThe RECOMIA platform includes modules for (1) local de-identification of medical images, (2) secure transfer of images to the cloud-based platform, (3) display functions available using a standard web browser, (4) tools for manual annotation of organs or pathology in the images, (5) deep learning-based tools for organ segmentation or other customised analyses, (6) tools for quantification of segmented volumes, and (7) an export function for the quantitative results. The AI-based tool for organ segmentation in CT currently handles 100 organs (77 bones and 23 soft tissue organs). The segmentation is based on two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): one network to handle organs with multiple similar instances, such as vertebrae and ribs, and one network for all other organs. The CNNs have been trained using CT studies from 339 patients. Experienced radiologists annotated organs in the CT studies. The performance of the segmentation tool, measured as mean Dice index on a manually annotated test set, with 10 representative organs, was 0.93 for all foreground voxels, and the mean Dice index over the organs were 0.86 (0.82 for the soft tissue organs and 0.90 for the bones).\nThe paper presents a platform that provides deep learning-based tools that can perform basic organ segmentations in CT, which can then be used to automatically obtain the different measurement in the corresponding PET image. The RECOMIA platform is available on request at www.recomia.org for research purposes.", "The methodology of deep learning, a component of machine learning and artificial intelligence, is introduced. The opportunity for this technology to automate some aspects of medical practice is reviewed. Finally, a discussion is provided on the integration of concepts from deep learning into medical education.", "Scoliosis is defined as the three-dimensional (3D) structural deformity of the spine with a radiological lateral Cobb angle (a measure of spinal curvature) of \u226510\u00b0 that can be caused by congenital, developmental or degenerative problems. However, those cases whose etiology is still unknown, and affect healthy children and adolescents during growth, are the commonest form of spinal deformity, known as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). In AIS management, early diagnosis and the accurate prediction of curve progression are most important because they can decrease negative long-term effects of AIS treatment, such as unnecessary bracing, frequent exposure to radiation, as well as saving the high costs of AIS treatment. Despite efforts made to identify a method or technique capable of predicting AIS progression, this challenge still remains unresolved. Genetics and epigenetics, and the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, open up new avenues to not only clarify AIS etiology, but to also identify potential biomarkers that can substantially improve the clinical management of these patients. This review presents the most relevant biomarkers to help explain the etiopathogenesis of AIS and provide new potential biomarkers to be validated in large clinical trials so they can be finally implemented into clinical settings.", "The cognitive profiles of patients suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN) are currently explored as potential facilitating and/or maintenance factors. Specific data in restrictive AN (AN-R) remain contradictory. This study focused on women with AN-R to evaluate their cognitive functions to develop a more specific cognitive remediation program.\nFemale patients older than 15\u00a0years who were suffering from AN-R were recruited in a specialized unit for eating disorder management. Female healthy control (HC) participants were recruited who were matched with AN patients on age. All participants completed a cognitive evaluation (premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ), planning, information processing speed, cognitive flexibility) and a clinical evaluation (impulsivity, anxiety, depression).\nA total of 122 participants were included. Patients suffering from AN-R had significant impairment in information processing speed and planning. Patients exhibited significantly better cognitive flexibility than did the HC group when adjustments were made for other cognitive functions and impulsivity. Two distinct subgroups of patients were identified. The first subgroup had more marked cognitive impairment and fewer psychopathological symptoms than did the second subgroup of patients and the HC group.\nOur results highlight cognitive impairment in patients with AN who had normal premorbid IQ. Two distinct profiles emerge. In clinical practice, these results open up perspectives for the development of more specific cognitive remediation programs (one specific program for cold cognitions and another specific program targeting emotions and hot cognitions). These results warrant confirmation by larger studies with a more specific evaluation of the impact of emotional status. Trial registration NTC02381639, Date of registration. March 6, 2015.", "Macphail famously criticized two foundational assumptions that underlie the evolutionary approach to comparative psychology: that there are differences in intelligence across species, and that intelligent behavior in animals is based on more than associative learning. Here, we provide evidence from recent work in avian cognition that supports both these assumptions: intelligence across species varies, and animals can perform intelligent behaviors that are not guided solely by associative learning mechanisms. Finally, we reflect on the limitations of comparative psychology that led to Macphail's claims and suggest strategies researchers can use to make more advances in the field.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have become a growing area of interest in predictive medicine and have the potential to aid physician decision-making to improve patient outcomes. Imaging and radiomics play an increasingly important role in these models. This review summarizes recent developments in the field of radiomics for AI in head and neck cancer. Prediction models for oncologic outcomes, treatment toxicity, and pathological findings have all been created. Exploratory studies are promising; however, validation studies that demonstrate consistency, reproducibility, and prognostic impact remain uncommon. Prospective clinical trials with standardized procedures are required for clinical translation.", "Fluoride, a pollutant present in contaminated ground water, oral care products, food, and pesticides, has deleterious effects in the structure and function of the central nervous system. Among the established neurological defects described in the exposed population, a reduced score in intelligence quotient tests in children of contaminated areas has gained attention over the past years. Maternal fluoride exposure during gestation decreases learning and memory abilities that correlate with a significant diminution of glutamate receptors expression. Since the involvement of glia cells in the maintenance and regulation of glutamatergic synapses is well-documented, in this contribution, we characterized the effect of fluoride exposure in the regulation of glia glutamine transporters. To this end, we used the M\u00fcller glia cell line, Mio-M1, and through the use of [3H]L-Glutamine uptake experiments and a Western blot approach, we demonstrate here the functional expression of system N of glutamine transporters, SNAT3 and SNAT5, in this model of human retina radial glia cells. Furthermore, these transporters interact with the glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter 1, in an activity-dependent manner. Fluoride treatment reduces glutamine uptake and cell membrane [3H]glutamine surface binding, in good correlation with a decrease in SNAT3 and 5 protein levels. These results demonstrate that glia cells respond to the presence of fluoride reducing glutamine mobilization and by these means decreases glutamate turnover suggesting a disruption of glutamatergic transmission.", "Fueled by new techniques, computational tools, and broader availability of imaging data, artificial intelligence has the potential to transform the practice of neuroradiology. The recent exponential increase in publications related to artificial intelligence and the central focus on artificial intelligence at recent professional and scientific radiology meetings underscores the importance. There is growing momentum behind leveraging artificial intelligence techniques to improve workflow and diagnosis and treatment and to enhance the value of quantitative imaging techniques. This article explores the reasons why neuroradiologists should care about the investments in new artificial intelligence applications, highlights current activities and the roles neuroradiologists are playing, and renders a few predictions regarding the near future of artificial intelligence in neuroradiology.", "Internet addiction has become a major global concern and a burden on mental health. However, there is a lack of consensus on its link to mental health outcomes.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the associations between internet addiction severity and adverse mental health outcomes.\nFirst-year undergraduates enrolled at Sichuan University during September 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 were invited to participate in the current study survey, 85.13% (31,659/37,187) of whom fully responded. Young's 20-item Internet Addiction Test, Patient Health Questionnaire-15, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Symptom Checklist 90, Six-Item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, and Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised were used to evaluate internet addiction, four psychopathologies (high somatic symptom severity, clinically significant depression, psychoticism, and paranoia), serious mental illness, and lifetime suicidality.\nThe prevalence of students with mild, moderate, and severe internet addiction was 37.93% (12,009/31,659), 6.33% (2003/31,659), and 0.20% (63/31,659), respectively. The prevalence rates of high somatic symptom severity, clinically significant depression, psychoticism, paranoid ideation, and serious mental illness were 6.54% (2072/31,659), 4.09% (1294/31,659), 0.51% (160/31,659), 0.52% (165/31,659), and 1.88% (594/31,659), respectively, and the lifetime prevalence rates of suicidal ideation, suicidal plan, and suicidal attempt were 36.31% (11,495/31,659), 5.13% (1624/31,659), and 1.00% (315/31,659), respectively. The prevalence rates and odds ratios (ORs) of the four psychopathologies and their comorbidities, screened serious mental illness, and suicidalities in the group without internet addiction were much lower than the average levels of the surveyed population. Most of these metrics in the group with mild internet addiction were similar to or slightly higher than the average rates; however, these rates sharply increased in the moderate and severe internet addiction groups. Among the four psychopathologies, clinically significant depression was most strongly associated with internet addiction after adjusting for the confounding effects of demographics and other psychopathologies, and its prevalence increased from 1.01% (178/17,584) in the students with no addiction to 4.85% (582/12,009), 24.81% (497/2,003), and 58.73% (37/63) in the students with mild, moderate, and severe internet addiction, respectively. The proportions of those with any of the four psychopathologies increased from 4.05% (713/17,584) to 11.72% (1408/12,009), 36.89% (739/2003), and 68.25% (43/63); those with lifetime suicidal ideation increased from 24.92% (4382/17,584) to 47.56% (5711/12,009), 67.70% (1356/2003), and 73.02% (46/63); those with a suicidal plan increased from 2.59% (456/17,584) to 6.77% (813/12,009), 16.72% (335/2003), and 31.75% (20/63); and those with a suicidal attempt increased from 0.50% (88/17,584) to 1.23% (148/12,009), 3.54% (71/2003), and 12.70% (8/63), respectively.\nModerate and severe internet addiction were strongly associated with a broad group of adverse mental health outcomes, including somatic symptoms that are the core features of many medical illnesses, although clinically significant depression showed the strongest association. This finding supports the illness validity of moderate and severe internet addiction in contrast to mild internet addiction. These results are important for informing health policymakers and service suppliers from the perspective of resolving the overall human health burden in the current era of \"Internet Plus\" and artificial intelligence.", "In the home care industry, the assignment and tracking of care services are controlled by care centers that are centralized in nature and prone to inefficient information transmission. A lack of trust among the involved parties, information opaqueness, and large manual manipulation result in lower process efficiency.\nThis study aimed to explore and demonstrate the application of blockchain and smart contract technologies to innovate/renovate home care services for harvesting the desired blockchain benefits of process transparency, traceability, and interoperability.\nAn object-oriented analysis/design combined with a unified modeling language tool was used to construct the architecture of the proposed home care service system. System feasibility was evaluated via an implementation test, and a questionnaire survey was performed to collect opinions from home care service respondents knowledgeable about blockchain and smart contracts.\nAccording to the comparative analysis results, the proposed design outperformed the existing system in terms of traceability, system efficiency, and process automation. Moreover, for the questionnaire survey, the quantitative analysis results showed that the proposed blockchain-based system had significantly (P<.001) higher mean scores (when compared with the existing system) in terms of important factors, including timeliness, workflow efficiency, automatic notifications, insurance functionality, and auditable traceability. In summary, blockchain-based home care service participants will be able to enjoy improved efficiency, better transparency, and higher levels of process automation.\nBlockchain and smart contracts can provide valuable benefits to the home care service industry via distributed data management and process automation. The proposed system enhances user experiences by mitigating human intervention and improving service interoperability, transparency/traceability, and real-time response to home care service events. Efforts in exploring and integrating blockchain-based home care services with emerging technologies, such as the internet of things and artificial intelligence, are expected to provide further benefits and therefore are subject to future research.", "We have arrived at an inflection point, a moment in history when the sentience, consciousness, intelligence, agency, and even the moral agency of many nonhuman animals can no longer be questioned without ignoring centuries of accumulated scientific knowledge. Nowhere is this more true than in our understanding of nonhuman primates (NHPs). A neuroethics committed to probing the ethical implications of brain research must be able to respond to and anticipate the challenges ahead as brain projects globally prepare to increase the use of NHPs in research. This requires adopting a less anthropocentric focus that includes nonhuman animals within its scope. But the Neuroethics Roadmap represents a missed opportunity to critically examine the future direction of research with NHPs in an ethically-responsive neuroscience.", "Inconsistencies across studies investigating subcortical correlates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may stem from small sample size, sample heterogeneity, and omitting or linearly adjusting for total brain volume (TBV). To properly adjust for TBV, brain allometry-the nonlinear scaling relationship between regional volumes and TBV-was considered when examining subcortical volumetric differences between typically developing (TD) and ASD individuals. Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I; N = 654) data was analyzed with two methodological approaches: univariate linear mixed effects models and multivariate multiple group confirmatory factor analyses. Analyses were conducted on the entire sample and in subsamples based on age, sex, and full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ). A similar ABIDE I study was replicated and the impact of different TBV adjustments on neuroanatomical group differences was investigated. No robust subcortical allometric or volumetric group differences were observed in the entire sample across methods. Exploratory analyses suggested that allometric scaling and volume group differences may exist in certain subgroups defined by age, sex, and/or FSIQ. The type of TBV adjustment influenced some reported volumetric and scaling group differences. This study supports the absence of robust volumetric differences between ASD and TD individuals in the investigated volumes when adjusting for brain allometry, expands the literature by finding no group difference in allometric scaling, and further suggests that differing TBV adjustments contribute to the variability of reported neuroanatomical differences in ASD.", "Some recent studies suggest that children and adolescents with different neurodevelopmental disorders perform worse in emotions recognition through facial expressions (ER) compared with typically developing peers. This impairment is also described in children with Specific Learning Disorders (SLD), compromising their scholastic achievement, social functioning, and quality of life. The purpose of our study is to evaluate ER skills in children and adolescents with SLD compared to a control group without learning disorders, and correlate them with intelligence and executive functions.\nOur work is a cross-sectional observational study. Sixty-three children and adolescents aged between 8 and 16 years, diagnosed with SLD, and 32 sex/age-matched controls without learning disorders were recruited. All participants were administered standardized neuropsychological tests, evaluating facial emotion recognition (NEPSY-II), executive functions (EpiTrack Junior), and intelligence profile (WISC-IV).\nEmotion recognition mean score was significantly lower in the SLD group than in the controls group on the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples (p < 0.001). The SLD group performed significantly lower than the control group in their abilities to identify neutral expressions, happiness, sadness, anger, and fear compared to controls (p < 0.001). ER scores were positively correlated to the executive functions scores. There was no correlation with the Total Intelligence Quotient scores but there is a significant positive correlation with Working Memory Index and Processing Speed Index measured by WISC.IV.\nOur study showed that children and adolescents with Specific Learning Disorders have facial emotion recognition impairment when compared with a group of peers without learning disorders. ER abilities were independent of their global intelligence but potentially related to executive functions.", "While shared personal experiences are a valued prerequisite of the peer supporter-service-user relationship, they have the potential to create harm. There are challenges in peer supporters being emotionally ready to hear the experiences of others, and how much personal information peers should disclose. As part of an international study that aimed to explore how peer supporters who worked in a neonatal context (providing support to parents whose infant(s) has received neonatal care) were trained and supported, new insights emerged into how peers' personal stories were used and modified to instil boundaries in peer support services. In this paper, we report on a secondary analysis of the data to describe how peer supporters' stories were valued, used, assessed and moderated in neonatal peer support services; to safeguard and promote positive outcomes for peers and parents. Following University ethics approval, a mixed-methods study comprising online surveys and follow-up interviews was undertaken. Surveys were distributed through existing contacts and via social media. Thirty-one managers/coordinators/trainers and 77 peer supporters completed the survey from 48 peer support services in 16 different countries, and 26 interviews were held with 27 survey respondents. Three themes describe variations in the types of stories that were preferred and when peers were perceived to be 'ready' to share them; the different means by which sharing personal accounts was encouraged and used to assess peer readiness; and the methods used to instil (and assess) boundaries in the stories the peers shared. In neonatal-related peer support provision, the expected use of peer supporters' stories resonates with the 'use of self' canon in social work practice. Peer supporters were expected to modify personal stories to ensure that service-user (parents) needs were primary, the information was beneficial, and harm was minimised. Further work to build resilience and emotional intelligence in peer supporters is needed.", "The COVID pandemic has been devastating for not only its direct impact on lives, physical health, socio-economic status of individuals, but also for its impact on mental health. Some individuals are affected psychologically more severely and will need additional care. However, the current health system is so fragmented and focused on caring for those infected that management of mental illness has been neglected. An integrated approach is needed to strengthen the health system, service providers and research to not only manage the current mental health problems related to COVID but develop robust strategies to overcome more long-term impact of the pandemic. A series of recommendations are outlined in this paper to help policy makers, service providers and other stakeholders, and research and research funders to strengthen existing mental health systems, develop new ones, and at the same time advance research to mitigate the mental health impact of COVID19. The recommendations refer to low, middle and high resource settings as capabilities vary greatly between countries and within countries.\nThe recommendations for policy makers are focused on strengthening leadership and governance, finance mechanisms, and developing programme and policies that especially include the most vulnerable populations. Service provision should focus on accessible and equitable evidence-based community care models commensurate with the existing mental health capacity to deliver care, train existing primary care staff to cater to increased mental health needs, implement prevention and promotion programmes tailored to local needs, and support civil societies and employers to address the increased burden of mental illness. Researchers and research funders should focus on research to develop robust information systems that can be enhanced further by linking with other data sources to run predictive models using artificial intelligence, understand neurobiological mechanisms and community-based interventions to address the pandemic driven mental health problems in an integrated manner and use innovative digital solutions.\nUrgent action is needed to strengthen mental health system in all settings. The recommendations outlined can be used as a guide to develop these further or identify new ones in relation to local needs.", "Echocardiography is an indispensable tool in diagnostic cardiology and is fundamental to clinical care. Significant advances in cardiovascular imaging technology paralleled by rapid growth in electronic medical records, miniaturized devices, real-time monitoring, and wearable devices using body sensor network technology have led to the development of complex data.\nThe intricate nature of these data can be overwhelming and exceed the capabilities of current statistical software. Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), can help health care providers navigate through this complex labyrinth of information and unravel hidden discoveries. Furthermore, ML algorithms can help automate several tasks in echocardiography and clinical care. ML can serve as a valuable diagnostic tool for physicians in the field of echocardiography. In addition, it can help expand the capabilities of research and discover alternative pathways in medical management. In this review article, we describe the role of AI and ML in echocardiography.", "After two decades of steady growing, symbiotic merger of organocatalysis with emerging electrochemical and photochemical tools are envisioned as hot topics in the coming decade. Here, these trends are discussed in parallel to the implementation of artificial intelligence-based technologies, which anticipate a paradigm shift in catalyst design.", "This study aimed to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the pathological diagnosis of ovarian tumors using patient information and data from preoperative examinations.\nA total of 202 patients with ovarian tumors were enrolled, including 53 with ovarian cancer, 23 with borderline malignant tumors, and 126 with benign ovarian tumors. Using 5 machine learning classifiers, including support vector machine, random forest, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and XGBoost, we derived diagnostic results from 16 features, commonly available from blood tests, patient background, and imaging tests. We also analyzed the importance of 16 features on the prediction of disease.\nThe highest accuracy was 0.80 in the machine learning algorithm of XGBoost. The evaluation of importance of the features showed different results among the correlation coefficient of the features, the regression coefficient, and the features importance of random forest.\nAI could play a role in the prediction of pathological diagnosis of ovarian cancer from preoperative examinations.", "The objective is to develop and validate an artificial intelligence model, specifically an artificial neural network (ANN), to predict length of stay (LOS), discharge disposition, and inpatient charges for primary anatomic total (aTSA), reverse total (rTSA), and hemi- (HSA) shoulder arthroplasty to establish internal validity in predicting patient-specific value metrics.\nUsing data from the National Inpatient Sample between 2003 and 2014, 4 different ANN models to predict LOS, discharge disposition, and inpatient costs using 39 preoperative variables were developed based on diagnosis and arthroplasty type: primary chronic/degenerative aTSA, primary chronic/degenerative rTSA, primary traumatic/acute rTSA, and primary acute/traumatic HSA. Models were also combined into diagnosis type only. Outcome metrics included accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) for a receiver operating characteristic curve.\nA total of 111,147 patients undergoing primary shoulder replacement were included. The machine learning algorithm predicting the overall chronic/degenerative conditions model (aTSA, rTSA) achieved accuracies of 76.5%, 91.8%, and 73.1% for total cost, LOS, and disposition, respectively; AUCs were 0.75, 0.89, and 0.77 for total cost, LOS, and disposition, respectively. The overall acute/traumatic conditions model (rTSA, HSA) had accuracies of 70.3%, 79.1%, and 72.0% and AUCs of 0.72, 0.78, and 0.79 for total cost, LOS, and discharge disposition, respectively.\nOur ANN demonstrated fair to good accuracy and reliability for predicting inpatient cost, LOS, and discharge disposition in shoulder arthroplasty for both chronic/degenerative and acute/traumatic conditions. Machine learning has the potential to preoperatively predict costs, LOS, and disposition using patient-specific data for expectation management between health care providers, patients, and payers.", "Machine learning (ML) systems are affected by a pervasive lack of transparency. The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) research area addresses this problem and the related issue of explaining the behavior of ML systems in terms that are understandable to human beings. In many explanation of XAI approaches, the output of ML systems are explained in terms of low-level features of their inputs. However, these approaches leave a substantive explanatory burden with human users, insofar as the latter are required to map low-level properties into more salient and readily understandable parts of the input. To alleviate this cognitive burden, an alternative model-agnostic framework is proposed here. This framework is instantiated to address explanation problems in the context of ML image classification systems, without relying on pixel relevance maps and other low-level features of the input. More specifically, one obtains sets of middle-level properties of classification inputs that are perceptually salient by applying sparse dictionary learning techniques. These middle-level properties are used as building blocks for explanations of image classifications. The achieved explanations are parsimonious, for their reliance on a limited set of middle-level image properties. And they can be contrastive, because the set of middle-level image properties can be used to explain why the system advanced the proposed classification over other antagonist classifications. In view of its model-agnostic character, the proposed framework is adaptable to a variety of other ML systems and explanation problems.", "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is perhaps the greatest global health challenge of the last century. Accompanying this pandemic is a parallel \"infodemic,\" including the online marketing and sale of unapproved, illegal, and counterfeit COVID-19 health products including testing kits, treatments, and other questionable \"cures.\" Enabling the proliferation of this content is the growing ubiquity of internet-based technologies, including popular social media platforms that now have billions of global users.\nThis study aims to collect, analyze, identify, and enable reporting of suspected fake, counterfeit, and unapproved COVID-19-related health care products from Twitter and Instagram.\nThis study is conducted in two phases beginning with the collection of COVID-19-related Twitter and Instagram posts using a combination of web scraping on Instagram and filtering the public streaming Twitter application programming interface for keywords associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 products. The second phase involved data analysis using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to identify potential sellers that were then manually annotated for characteristics of interest. We also visualized illegal selling posts on a customized data dashboard to enable public health intelligence.\nWe collected a total of 6,029,323 tweets and 204,597 Instagram posts filtered for terms associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 health products from March to April for Twitter and February to May for Instagram. After applying our NLP and deep learning approaches, we identified 1271 tweets and 596 Instagram posts associated with questionable sales of COVID-19-related products. Generally, product introduction came in two waves, with the first consisting of questionable immunity-boosting treatments and a second involving suspect testing kits. We also detected a low volume of pharmaceuticals that have not been approved for COVID-19 treatment. Other major themes detected included products offered in different languages, various claims of product credibility, completely unsubstantiated products, unapproved testing modalities, and different payment and seller contact methods.\nResults from this study provide initial insight into one front of the \"infodemic\" fight against COVID-19 by characterizing what types of health products, selling claims, and types of sellers were active on two popular social media platforms at earlier stages of the pandemic. This cybercrime challenge is likely to continue as the pandemic progresses and more people seek access to COVID-19 testing and treatment. This data intelligence can help public health agencies, regulatory authorities, legitimate manufacturers, and technology platforms better remove and prevent this content from harming the public.", "Cardiac imaging is becoming commonplace throughout radiology practices and is increasingly important in large-cohort prospective cardiovascular trials and in statements and guidelines. In this review, the authors summarize some of the most important imaging findings relevant to clinical practice in the past year. Key coronary CT angiography studies have included rigorous meta-analysis of its diagnostic accuracy, prognostic implications of adverse coronary plaque features, and sex differences. The value of CT for catheter-delivered valve implantation (eg, transcatheter aortic and mitral valve replacements) was further elucidated in large-cohort outcome trials. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy registries have revealed distinct clinical and MRI phenotypes, highlighting different underlying causes, while others clarified the prognostic usefulness of MRI in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Fabry disease. Artificial intelligence and/or machine learning was applied to many aspects of cardiovascular imaging, while evidence of the benefits of both adenosine stress perfusion cardiac MRI and coronary CT angiography-derived fractional flow reserve from real-world trials has increased. Studies on vaping and vascular endothelial function and the whole-body MRI depiction of metabolic syndrome consequences were also noteworthy. Although this review focuses on Radiology articles, key articles from high-impact clinical journals are also included. Although not possible to detail all articles because of space limitations, the authors attempted to highlight those with the most pragmatic and scientific value.", "Visuospatial memory (VSM) is the ability to represent and manipulate visual and spatial information. This cognitive function depends on the functioning of the hippocampal formation (HF), located in the medial portion of the temporal cortex. The present study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between the volume of the HF and performance in VSM tests. High-resolution structural images (T1) and neuropsychological tests evaluating VSM were performed on 31 healthy individuals. A VSM index was created by grouping 5 variables from 5 tasks (4 from the CANTAB battery and 1 from the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test). Multiple linear regression models using the volumes of HF subregions as independent variables and the VSM index as the dependent variable were conducted to test the hypothesis that memory performance could be predicted by HF volumes. We also conducted analyses to explore the role of covariates that may mediate this relationship, specifically age and intelligence quotient (IQ). We found significant associations between the hippocampal subregions of the left hemisphere and the VSM index (F(7,22)=2.758, P=0.032, R2a=0.298). When IQ was accounted for as a covariate, we also found significant results for the right hemisphere (F(8,21)=2.804, P=0.028, R2a=0.517). We concluded that the bilateral hippocampal formations contributed to performance on VSM tasks. Also, VSM processing is essential for a diverse set of daily activities and may be influenced by demographic variables in healthy subjects.", "In artificial intelligence and deep learning applications, data collection from a variety of objects is of great interest. One way to support such data collection is to use very thin, mechanically flexible sensor sheets, which can cover an object without altering the original shape. This study proposes a thin, macroscale, flexible, tactile pressure sensor array fabricated by a simple process for economical device applications. Using laser-induced graphene, a transfer process, and a printing method, a relatively stable, reliable, macroscale, thin (\u223c300 \u03bcm), flexible, tactile pressure sensor is realized. The detectable pressure range is about tens to hundreds of kPa. Then, as a proof-of-concept, the uniformity, sensitivity, repeatability, object mapping, finger pressure distribution, and pressure mapping are demonstrated under bending conditions. Although many flexible, tactile pressure sensors have been reported, the proposed structure has the potential for macroscale, thin, flexible, tactile pressure sensor sheets because of the simple and easy fabrication process.", "This paper describes the design and implementation of a software system to improve the management of diabetes using a machine learning approach and to demonstrate and evaluate its effectiveness in controlling diabetes. The proposed approach for this management system handles the various factors that affect the health of people with diabetes by combining multiple artificial intelligence algorithms. The proposed framework factors the diabetes management problem into subgoals: building a Tensorflow neural network model for food classification; thus, it allows users to upload an image to determine if a meal is recommended for consumption; implementing K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm to recommend meals; using cognitive sciences to build a diabetes question and answer chatbot; tracking user activity, user geolocation, and generating pdfs of logged blood sugar readings. The food recognition model was evaluated with cross-entropy metrics that support validation using Neural networks with a backpropagation algorithm. The model learned features of the images fed from local Ghanaian dishes with specific nutritional value and essence in managing diabetics and provided accurate image classification with given labels and corresponding accuracy. The model achieved specified goals by predicting with high accuracy, labels of new images. The food recognition and classification model achieved over 95% accuracy levels for specific calorie intakes. The performance of the meal recommender model and question and answer chatbot was tested with a designed cross-platform user-friendly interface using Cordova and Ionic Frameworks for software development for both mobile and web applications. The system recommended meals to meet the calorific needs of users successfully using KNN (with k = 5) and answered questions asked in a human-like way. The implemented system would solve the problem of managing activity, dieting recommendations, and medication notification of diabetics.", "Wearables and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital health platforms that utilize machine learning algorithms can autonomously measure a senior's change in activity and behavior and may be useful tools for proactive interventions that target modifiable risk factors.\nThe goal of this study was to analyze how a wearable device and AI-powered digital health platform could provide improved health outcomes for older adults in assisted living communities.\nData from 490 residents from six assisted living communities were analyzed retrospectively over 24 months. The intervention group (+CP) consisted of 3 communities that utilized CarePredict (n=256), and the control group (-CP) consisted of 3 communities (n=234) that did not utilize CarePredict. The following outcomes were measured and compared to baseline: hospitalization rate, fall rate, length of stay (LOS), and staff response time.\nThe residents of the +CP and -CP communities exhibit no statistical difference in age (P=.64), sex (P=.63), and staff service hours per resident (P=.94). The data show that the +CP communities exhibited a 39% lower hospitalization rate (P=.02), a 69% lower fall rate (P=.01), and a 67% greater length of stay (P=.03) than the -CP communities. The staff alert acknowledgment and reach resident times also improved in the +CP communities by 37% (P=.02) and 40% (P=.02), respectively.\nThe AI-powered digital health platform provides the community staff with actionable information regarding each resident's activities and behavior, which can be used to identify older adults that are at an increased risk for a health decline. Staff can use this data to intervene much earlier, protecting seniors from conditions that left untreated could result in hospitalization. In summary, the use of wearables and AI-powered digital health platform can contribute to improved health outcomes for seniors in assisted living communities. The accuracy of the system will be further validated in a larger trial.", "Artificial intelligence provides new feasibilities to the control of dexterous prostheses. To achieve suitable grasps over various objects, a novel computer vision-based classification method assorting objects into different grasp patterns is proposed in this paper. This method can be applied in the autonomous control of the multi-fingered prosthetic hand, as it can help users rapidly complete \"reach-and-pick up\" tasks on various daily objects with low demand on the myoelectric control. Firstly, an RGB-D image database (121 objects) was established according to four important grasp patterns (cylindrical, spherical, tripod, and lateral). The image samples in the RGB-D dataset were acquired on a large variety of daily objects of different sizes, shapes, postures (16), as well as different illumination conditions (4) and camera positions (4). Then, different inputs and structures of the discrimination model (multilayer CNN) were tested in terms of the classification success rate through cross-validation. Our results showed that depth data play an important role in grasp pattern recognition. The bimodal data (Gray-D) integrating both grayscale and depth information about the objects can improve the classification accuracy acquired from the RGB images (> 10%) effectively. Within the database, the network could achieve the classification with high accuracy (98%); it also has a strong generalization capability on novel samples (93.9 \u00b1 3.0%). We finally applied the method on a dexterous prosthetic hand and tested the whole system on performing the \"reach-and-pick up\" tasks. The experiments showed that the proposed computer vision-based myoelectric control method (Vision-EMG) could significantly improve the control effectiveness (6.4 s), with comparison to the traditional coding-based myoelectric control method (Coding-EMG, 13 s ).", "Diabetic retinopathy is the most common specific complication of diabetes mellitus. Traditional care for patients with diabetes and diabetic retinopathy is fragmented, uncoordinated and delivered in a piecemeal nature, often in the most expensive and high-resource tertiary settings. Transformative new models incorporating digital technology are needed to address these gaps in clinical care.\nArtificial intelligence and telehealth may improve access, financial sustainability and coverage of diabetic retinopathy screening programs. They enable risk stratifying patients based on individual risk of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy including diabetic macular edema (DME), and predicting which patients with DME best respond to antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy.\nProgress in artificial intelligence and tele-ophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy screening, including artificial intelligence applications in 'real-world settings' and cost-effectiveness studies are summarized. Furthermore, the initial research on the use of artificial intelligence models for diabetic retinopathy risk stratification and management of DME are outlined along with potential future directions. Finally, the need for artificial intelligence adoption within ophthalmology in response to coronavirus disease 2019 is discussed. Digital health solutions such as artificial intelligence and telehealth can facilitate the integration of community, primary and specialist eye care services, optimize the flow of patients within healthcare networks, and improve the efficiency of diabetic retinopathy management.", "Mass production and use of antibiotics has led to the rise of resistant bacteria, a problem possibly exacerbated by inappropriate and non-optimal application. Antibiotic treatment often follows fixed-dose regimens, with a standard dose of antibiotic administered equally spaced in time. But are such fixed-dose regimens optimal or can alternative regimens be designed to increase efficacy? Yet, few mathematical models have aimed to identify optimal treatments based on biological data of infections inside a living host. In addition, assumptions to make the mathematical models analytically tractable limit the search space of possible treatment regimens (e.g. to fixed-dose treatments). Here, we aimed to address these limitations by using experiments in a Galleria mellonella (insect) model of bacterial infection to create a fully parametrised mathematical model of a systemic Vibrio infection. We successfully validated this model with biological experiments, including treatments unseen by the mathematical model. Then, by applying artificial intelligence, this model was used to determine optimal antibiotic dosage regimens to treat the host to maximise survival while minimising total antibiotic used. As expected, host survival increased as total quantity of antibiotic applied during the course of treatment increased. However, many of the optimal regimens tended to follow a large initial 'loading' dose followed by doses of incremental reductions in antibiotic quantity (dose 'tapering'). Moreover, application of the entire antibiotic in a single dose at the start of treatment was never optimal, except when the total quantity of antibiotic was very low. Importantly, the range of optimal regimens identified was broad enough to allow the antibiotic prescriber to choose a regimen based on additional criteria or preferences. Our findings demonstrate the utility of an insect host to model antibiotic therapies in vivo and the approach lays a foundation for future regimen optimisation for patient and societal benefits.", "Most studies of associations between child growth and cognitive ability were based on size at one or two ages and a single measure of cognition. We aimed to characterize different aspects of early growth and their associations with cognitive outcomes in childhood through adolescence.\nIn a sample of 12\u2009368 Belarusian children born at term, we examined associations of length/height and weight trajectories over the first 6.5\u2009years of life with cognitive ability at 6.5 and 16\u2009years and its change over time. We estimated growth trajectories using two random-effects models-the SuperImposition by Translation and Rotation to model overall patterns of growth and the Jenss-Bayley to distinguish growth in infancy from post infancy. Cognitive ability was measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence at 6.5\u2009years and the computerized NeuroTrax test at 16\u2009years.\nHigher length/height between birth and 6.5\u2009years was associated with higher cognitive scores at 6.5 and 16\u2009years {2.7 points [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1, 3.2] and 2.5 points [95% CI: 1.9, 3.0], respectively, per standard deviation [SD] increase}. A 1-SD delay in the childhood height-growth spurt was negatively associated with cognitive scores [-2.4 (95% CI: -3.0, -1.8) at age 6.5; -2.2 (95% CI: -2.7, -1.6) at 16\u2009years]. Birth size and post-infancy growth velocity were positively associated with cognitive scores at both ages. Height trajectories were not associated with the change in cognitive score. Similar results were observed for weight trajectories.\nAmong term infants, the overall size, timing of the childhood growth spurt, size at birth and post-infancy growth velocity were all associated with cognitive ability at early-school age and adolescence.", "Recently, deep convolutional neural network has significantly improved image classification and image segmentation. If coronary artery disease (CAD) can be diagnosed through machine learning and deep learning, it will significantly reduce the burdens of the doctors and accelerate the critical patient diagnoses. The purpose of the study is to assess the practicability of utilizing deep learning approaches to process coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) imaging (termed CCTA-artificial intelligence, CCTA-AI) in coronary artery stenosis.\nA CCTA reconstruction pipeline was built by utilizing deep learning and transfer learning approaches to generate auto-reconstructed CCTA images based on a series of two-dimensional (2D) CT images. 150 patients who underwent successively CCTA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) from June 2017 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The dataset was divided into two parts comprising training dataset and testing dataset. The training dataset included the CCTA images of 100 patients which are trained using convolutional neural networks (CNN) in order to further identify various plaque classifications and coronary stenosis. The other 50 CAD patients acted as testing dataset that is evaluated by comparing the auto-reconstructed CCTA images with traditional CCTA images on the condition that DSA images are regarded as the reference method. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used for statistical analysis to compare CCTA-AI with DSA and traditional CCTA in the aspect of detecting coronary stenosis and plaque features.\nAI significantly reduces time for post-processing and diagnosis comparing to the traditional methods. In identifying various degrees of coronary stenosis, the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA-AI is better than traditional CCTA (AUCAI\u00a0=\u00a00.870, AUCCCTA = 0.781, P < 0.001). In identifying \u2265 50% stenotic vessels, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of CCTA-AI and traditional method are 86% and 83%, 88% and 59%, 85% and 94%, 73% and 84%, 94% and 83%, respectively. In the aspect of identifying plaque classification, accuracy of CCTA-AI is moderate compared to traditional CCTA (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.750, P < 0.001).\nThe proposed CCTA-AI allows the generation of auto-reconstructed CCTA images from a series of 2D CT images. This approach is relatively accurate for detecting \u226550% stenosis and analyzing plaque features compared to traditional CCTA.", "The importance of clinical outcome prediction models using artificial intelligence (AI) is being emphasized owing to the increasing necessity of developing a clinical decision support system (CDSS) employing AI. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a \"Dr. Answer\" AI software based on the clinical outcome prediction model for prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.\nThe Dr. Answer AI was developed based on a clinical outcome prediction model, with a user-friendly interface. We used 7,128 clinical data of prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy from three hospitals. An outcome prediction model was developed to calculate the probability of occurrence of 1) tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging, 2) extracapsular extension, 3) seminal vesicle invasion, and 4) lymph node metastasis. Random forest and k-nearest neighbors algorithms were used, and the proposed system was compared with previous algorithms.\nRandom forest exhibited good performance for TNM staging (recall value: 76.98%), while k-nearest neighbors exhibited good performance for extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node metastasis (80.24%, 98.67%, and 95.45%, respectively). The Dr. Answer AI software consisted of three primary service structures: 1) patient information, 2) clinical outcome prediction, and outcomes according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline.\nThe proposed clinical outcome prediction model could function as an effective CDSS, supporting the decisions of the physicians, while enabling the patients to understand their treatment outcomes. The Dr. Answer AI software for prostate cancer helps the doctors to explain the treatment outcomes to the patients, allowing the patients to be more confident about their treatment plans.", "Oxygen is an important factor in the wine aging process, and the oxygen transmission rate (OTR) is the parameter of the wood that reflects its oxygen permeation. OTR has not been considered in the cooperage industry yet; however, recent studies proposed a nondestructive method for estimating the OTR of barrel staves, but an efficient method to combine these staves to build barrels with a desired OTR is needed to implement it in the industry. This article proposes artificial intelligence methods for selecting staves for the construction of barrel heads or bodies with a desired target OTR. Genetic algorithms were used to implement these methods in consideration of the known OTR of the staves and the geometry of the wine barrels. The proposed methods were evaluated in several scenarios: homogenizing the OTR of the actual constructed barrels, constructing low-OTR and high-OTR barrels based on a preclassification of the staves and implementing the proposed method in real cooperage conditions. The results of these experiments suggest the suitability of the proposed methods for their implementation in a cooperage in order to build controlled OTR barrels.", "This paper presents a novel user experience optimization concept and method, named User Experience Sensor, applied within the Hybrid Intelligence System (HINT). The HINT system, defined as a combination of an extensive AI system and the possibility of attaching a human expert, is designed to be used by relational agents, which may have a physical form, such as a robot, a kiosk, be embodied in an avatar, or may also exist as only software. The proposed method focuses on automatic process evaluation as a common sensor for optimization of the user experience for every process stage and the indicator for human-expert automatic session activation. This functionality is realized by the User Experience Sensor, which constitutes one of main elements of the self-optimizing interaction system. The authors present the optimization mechanism of the HINT system as an analogy to the process of building a Tower of Hanoi. The proposed sensor evaluates the user experience and measures the user/employee efficiency at every stage of a given process, offering the user to choose other forms of information, interaction, or expert support. The designed HINT system is able to learn and self-optimize, making the entire process more intuitive and easy for each and every user individually. The HINT system with the proposed sensor, implemented in a window assembly facility, successfully reduced assembly time, increased employees' satisfaction, and assembly quality. The proposed approach can be implemented in numerous man-machine interaction applications.", "Multimodal imaging (MMI) allows a more granular grading of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) disease severity, with many novel risk factors having been recently identified. With this imaging information, we are better able to counsel our patients with more accurate and individualized progression scenarios. MMI also allows identification of anatomical features that increase our understanding of disease processes involved in progression to late AMD. Treatment protocols for neovascular AMD (nAMD) depend largely on the optical coherence tomography (OCT) appearance to determine disease activity, which allows us to individualize treatment. In geographic atrophy (GA), new intervention trials require the ability to define the extent of GA, so that GA growth rate can be determined. This is achieved through fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, which allows greater accuracy of border identification, as well as revealing FAF patterns predictive of growth rates. As we strive to bring interventions earlier in the disease course, OCT imaging provides an ability to identify the first signs of atrophy, which may serve as novel surrogate biomarkers for GA, thereby facilitating trials. In the future, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically identify relevant features on MMI could further enhance our ability to determine disease severity, predict progression and assist in identifying disease activity parameters to support clinical decision making when treating nAMD. Newer developments may allow frequent, remote capturing of images, reducing clinic visits, detecting progression and monitoring neovascular activity in-between clinic visits. Being aware of these new imaging insights in AMD, greatly enhance our clinical management of AMD.", "Machine learning (ML) is a subdomain of artificial intelligence that enables computers to abstract patterns from data without explicit programming. A myriad of impactful ML applications already exists in orthopaedics ranging from predicting infections after surgery to diagnostic imaging. However, no systematic reviews that we know of have compared, in particular, the performance of ML models with that of clinicians in musculoskeletal imaging to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of applying ML to imaging diagnoses. By doing so, this review delves into where current ML developments stand in aiding orthopaedists in assessing musculoskeletal images.\nThis systematic review aimed (1) to compare performance of ML models versus clinicians in detecting, differentiating, or classifying orthopaedic abnormalities on imaging by (A) accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, (B) input features (for example, plain radiographs, MRI scans, ultrasound), (C) clinician specialties, and (2) to compare the performance of clinician-aided versus unaided ML models.\nA systematic review was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published up to October 1, 2019, using synonyms for machine learning and all potential orthopaedic specialties. We included all studies that compared ML models head-to-head against clinicians in the binary detection of abnormalities in musculoskeletal images. After screening 6531 studies, we ultimately included 12 studies. We conducted quality assessment using the Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) checklist. All 12 studies were of comparable quality, and they all clearly included six of the eight critical appraisal items (study aim, input feature, ground truth, ML versus human comparison, performance metric, and ML model description). This justified summarizing the findings in a quantitative form by calculating the median absolute improvement of the ML models compared with clinicians for the following metrics of performance: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\nML models provided, in aggregate, only very slight improvements in diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared with clinicians working alone and were on par in specificity (3% (interquartile range [IQR] -2.0% to 7.5%), 0.06% (IQR -0.03 to 0.14), and 0.00 (IQR -0.048 to 0.048), respectively). Inputs used by the ML models were plain radiographs (n = 8), MRI scans (n = 3), and ultrasound examinations (n = 1). Overall, ML models outperformed clinicians more when interpreting plain radiographs than when interpreting MRIs (17 of 34 and 3 of 16 performance comparisons, respectively). Orthopaedists and radiologists performed similarly to ML models, while ML models mostly outperformed other clinicians (outperformance in 7 of 19, 7 of 23, and 6 of 10 performance comparisons, respectively). Two studies evaluated the performance of clinicians aided and unaided by ML models; both demonstrated considerable improvements in ML-aided clinician performance by reporting a 47% decrease of misinterpretation rate (95% confidence interval [CI] 37 to 54; p < 0.001) and a mean increase in specificity of 0.048 (95% CI 0.029 to 0.068; p < 0.001) in detecting abnormalities on musculoskeletal images.\nAt present, ML models have comparable performance to clinicians in assessing musculoskeletal images. ML models may enhance the performance of clinicians as a technical supplement rather than as a replacement for clinical intelligence. Future ML-related studies should emphasize how ML models can complement clinicians, instead of determining the overall superiority of one versus the other. This can be accomplished by improving transparent reporting, diminishing bias, determining the feasibility of implantation in the clinical setting, and appropriately tempering conclusions.\nLevel III, diagnostic study.", "Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in wireless infrastructure, real-time collection, and processing of end-user devices is now in high demand. It is now superlative to use AI to detect and predict pandemics of a colossal nature. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which originated in Wuhan China, has had disastrous effects on the global community and has overburdened advanced healthcare systems throughout the world. Globally; over 4,063,525 confirmed cases and 282,244 deaths have been recorded as of 11th May 2020, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control agency. However, the current rapid and exponential rise in the number of patients has necessitated efficient and quick prediction of the possible outcome of an infected patient for appropriate treatment using AI techniques. This paper proposes a fine-tuned Random Forest model boosted by the AdaBoost algorithm. The model uses the COVID-19 patient's geographical, travel, health, and demographic data to predict the severity of the case and the possible outcome, recovery, or death. The model has an accuracy of 94% and a F1 Score of 0.86 on the dataset used. The data analysis reveals a positive correlation between patients' gender and deaths, and also indicates that the majority of patients are aged between 20 and 70 years.", "Intelligence requires sufficient working-memory capacity. Traditionally, working memory was seen as a process and as a prerequisite for fluid intelligence. Working memory was assumed to be determined by maturation and health. There is a gap in the literature: It is still not fully understood to which extent and how working memory can be influenced. So this study tested how visual impairment and the extent of visual impairment are related to working memory capacity. In our study we compared N = 249 children (6-16 years) with and without visual impairment (blind, visually impaired, and sighted) in two countries (South Africa and Austria) at different development levels on their working-memory capacity and verbal comprehension. Using the WISC-IV, blind and visually impaired children showed higher working-memory capacity than sighted children (r = + 0.35, 14, and 3 IQ points, respectively). On the other hand, visually impaired children showed a weakness in verbal comprehension (r = -0.39, on average 13 IQ points lower). The pattern remained robust when SES and race-ethnicity were controlled. Our natural (quasi-)experiment shows a pattern, which is unlikely to be genetic, and so supports the view that working memory and intelligence scores can be modified.", "Big data is the fuel of mankind's fourth industrial revolution. Coupled with new technology such as artificial intelligence and deep learning, the potential of big data is poised to be harnessed to its maximal in years to come. In ophthalmology, given the data-intensive nature of this specialty, big data will similarly play an important role. Electronic medical records, administrative and health insurance databases, mega national biobanks, crowd source data from mobile applications and social media, and international epidemiology consortia are emerging forms of \"big data\" in ophthalmology. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of big data, its potential applications in ophthalmology, and the challenges in leveraging and using these data. Importantly, in the next phase of work, it will be pertinent to further translate \"big data\" findings into real-world applications, to improve quality of eye care, and cost-effectiveness and efficiency of health services in ophthalmology.", "Innovation is a form of realising a new way of doing something, often ignoring traditional wisdom, in order to meet new challenges. Globally, particularly in emerging economies, the high burden of musculoskeletal conditions and their contribution to multimorbidity continue to rise, as does the gap for services to deliver essential care. There is a growing need to find solutions to this challenge and deliver person-centred and integrated care, wherein empowering patients with the capacity for self-management is critical. Whilst there is an abundance of information available online to support consumer education, the number of sources for credible medical information is diluted by uninformed anecdotal social media solutions. Even with the provision of high-quality information, behavioural change does not necessarily follow, and more robust educational approaches are required. In this chapter, we examine innovation, its management and the strategic directions required to improve musculoskeletal healthcare at macro (policy), meso (service delivery) and micro (clinical practice) levels. We discuss the critical role of consumer agency (patients and their families/carers) in driving innovation and the need to leverage this through empowerment by education. We provide a snapshot of real-world examples of innovative practices including capacity building in consumer and interprofessional musculoskeletal education and practice; recommendations to transform the access and delivery of integrated, person-centred care; and initiatives in musculoskeletal care and implementation of models of care, enabled by digital health solutions including telehealth, remote monitoring, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and big data. We provide emerging evidence for how innovation can support systems' strengthening and build capacity to support improved access to 'right' musculoskeletal care, and explore some of the ways to best manage innovations. We conclude with recommended systematic steps to establish required leadership, collaboration, research, networking, dissemination, implementation and evaluation of future innovations in musculoskeletal health and care.", "Many children in need do not receive the psychoeducational evaluation services they need, with an estimated 15% of all students struggling with attentional or learning difficulties that are unassessed, and thus unaddressed, during \"normal\" times. Such evaluations have largely halted during the COVID-19 crisis, with questionable psychometrics of usable measures and clinicians largely unprepared to administer them. Remote, online psychoeducational evaluations have the potential to decrease this access problem by allowing for evaluations to continue during the crisis, as well as redistributing (geographically and potentially socioeconomically) evaluators to populations disproportionately without access. The present study evaluated the equivalence of a remote, online administration procedure for the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V) with traditional, in-person administration. Results revealed no significant differences-and, therefore, method effects-between the full-scale IQ and index scores between the administration procedures. One subtest did reveal a significant method effect, with children performing more poorly on the remote, online version of the test. Although imperfect, the remote, online procedure is a viable alternative for the traditional, in-person administration of the WISC-V, especially during this time of crisis.

In this review, we summarize recent developments in the application of artificial intelligence algorithms for estimating the risks of malignancy in a thyroid nodule.\nArtificial intelligence have been used to predict malignancy in thyroid nodules using ultrasound images, cytopathology images, and molecular markers. Recent clinical trials have shown that artificial intelligence model's performance matched that of experienced radiologists and pathologists. Explainable artificial intelligence models are being developed to avoid the black box problem. Risk stratification algorithms using artificial intelligence for thyroid nodules are now commercially available in many countries.\nArtificial intelligence models could become a useful tool in a thyroidolgist's armamentarium as a decision support tool. Increased adoption of this emerging technology will depend upon increased awareness of the potential benefits and pitfalls in using artificial intelligence.", "Prenatal exposures to phthalates and bisphenols are associated with impaired brain development in animals. However, epidemiological studies investigating the association between prenatal phthalate or bisphenol exposure and cognition have produced mixed findings and mostly had modest sample sizes and measured the exposure during the third trimester.\nWe examined the association between pregnancy maternal urinary biomarkers of phthalate or bisphenol exposure and nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ) in children 6 years of age.\nThe study sample consisted of 1,282 mother-child pairs participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based birth cohort in Rotterdam, Netherlands (enrollment 2002-2006). We measured maternal urinary concentrations of 18 phthalate metabolites and 8 bisphenols at <18, 18-25, and >25\u2009wks of gestation. Child nonverbal IQ was measured at 6 years of age using the Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test-Revised. Linear regression models were fit for each of the three collection phases separately, the three collection phases jointly, and for the averaged prenatal exposure across pregnancy.\nHigher urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites during early pregnancy were associated with lower child nonverbal IQ score [e.g., B per 10-fold increase in summed low-molecular weight phthalates=-1.7 (95% CI: -3.1, -0.3)]. This association remained unchanged when adjusted for mid and late pregnancy exposures. We also observed an inverse association between late pregnancy di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP) exposure and nonverbal IQ. Maternal urinary concentrations of bisphenols were not associated with child nonverbal IQ. There was no effect estimate modification by sex.\nWe did not observe that maternal biomarkers of bisphenol exposure are associated with nonverbal IQ. We found that phthalate exposure in early pregnancy and DNOP exposure in late pregnancy are associated with lower nonverbal IQ scores in children. Our results might suggest that particularly early pregnancy is a sensitive window of phthalate exposure, but future studies are needed to replicate our findings. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6047.", "The way chemists represent chemical structures as two-dimensional sketches made up of atoms and bonds, simplifying the complex three-dimensional molecules comprising nuclei and electrons of the quantum mechanical description, is the everyday language of chemistry. This language uses models, particularly of bonding, that are not contained in the quantum mechanical description of chemical systems, but has been used to derive machine-readable formats for storing and manipulating chemical structures in digital computers. This language is fuzzy and varies from chemist to chemist but has been astonishingly successful and perhaps contributes with its fuzziness to the success of chemistry. It is this creative imagination of chemical structures that has been fundamental to the cognition of chemistry and has allowed thought experiments to take place. Within the everyday language, the model nature of these concepts is not always clear to practicing chemists, so that controversial discussions about the merits of alternative models often arise. However, the extensive use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in chemistry, with the aim of being able to make reliable predictions, will require that these models be extended to cover all relevant properties and characteristics of chemical systems. This, in turn, imposes conditions such as completeness, compactness, computational efficiency and non-redundancy on the extensions to the almost universal Lewis and VSEPR bonding models. Thus, AI and ML are likely to be important in rationalizing, extending and standardizing chemical bonding models. This will not affect the everyday language of chemistry but may help to understand the unique basis of chemical language.", "Limited utility of quality health data undermines efforts to strengthen healthcare delivery, particularly in resource-limited settings. Few studies model the effective utility of quality pharmaceutical information system (PIS) data in sub-Saharan Africa, typified with weak health systems.\nTo develop a model and guidelines for strengthening utility of quality PIS data in public healthcare in Namibia, a resource-limited setting.\nA qualitative model based on Dickoff et al. practice-oriented theory, Chinn and Jacobs' systematic approach to theory, and applied consensus techniques. Data from nationwide studies on quality and utility of PIS data in public healthcare conducted between 2018 and March 2020 informed the development of the model concepts. Pharmaceutical and public health systems experts validated the final model.\nOverall, four preliminary national studies that recruited 58 PIS focal persons at 38 public health facilities and national level informed the development of four model concepts. The model describes concepts on access, management, dissemination, and utility of quality PIS data. Activities to implement the model in practice include grass-root integration of real-time automated pharmaceutical intelligence systems to collect, consolidate, monitor, and report PIS data. Strengthening coordination, human resources, and technical capacity through support supervisory systems at grass-root facilities are key activities. PIS focal persons at health facility and national level are agents to implement these activities among recipients, that is, healthcare professionals at points of care. Guidelines for implementation of the model at point of care are included. Experts described the model as clear, simple, comprehensive, and integration of pharmaceutical intelligence systems at point of care as novel and of importance to enhance utility of quality PIS data in resource-limited settings.\nWhile utility of quality PIS data is limited in Namibia, advantages of the model are encouraging, toward building resilient pharmaceutical intelligence systems at grass roots in resource-limited countries, where there are not only weak health systems, but high burden of misuse of medicines.", "Anterior open bite (AOB) is related to functional alterations of the stomatognathic system. There are no studies concerning brain activation of the cortex comparing children with and without AOB during rest and activities such as deglutition and phonation. The aim of this study was to determine the activity of the brain cortex of children with AOB at rest and during phonation and deglutition and to evaluate the association of intelligence quotient (IQ), attention (Test of Variables of Attention, known as TOVA), beats per minute (BPM), and oxygen saturation measurement (SpO2) with brain activity in subjects with AOB. Fourteen children (seven with AOB and seven without AOB) with mixed dentition, aged 10-13 years, underwent an IQ test, TOVA, SpO2, and quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). Electrodes were set in the scalp, according to the 10-20 protocol. Data were analyzed using statistical tests to assess comparisons between children with and without AOB. The results showed that IQ, TOVA, SpO2, or BPM did not show any statistically significant differences between the groups, except for the response time (contained in TOVA) (p = 0.03). Significant differences were found for the brain activity during rest (Condition 1) of the tongue, between children with and without AOB (p < 0.05 for alpha/theta and alpha peaks), whereas there were no differences during function (Condition 2). The findings of this investigation provide insights about the cortex activity of the brain while the tongue is in the resting position in children with AOB. This may imply an altered activity of the brain cortex, which should be considered when diagnosing and treating AOB. Other diagnostic techniques derived from investigations based on neuroscience could develop new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques to give better solutions to children with malocclusions. Treatments should be focused not only on the teeth but also on the brain cortex.", "Mutations that cause an error in the splicing of a messenger RNA (mRNA) can lead to diseases in humans. Various computational models have been developed to recognize the sequence pattern of the splice sites. In recent studies, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were shown to outperform other existing models in predicting the splice sites. However, an insufficient effort has been put into extending the CNN model to predict the effect of the genomic variants on the splicing of mRNAs. This study proposes a framework to elaborate on the utility of CNNs to assess the effect of splice variants on the identification of potential disease-causing variants that disrupt the RNA splicing process. Five models, including three CNN-based and two non-CNN machine learning based, were trained and compared using two existing splice site datasets, Genome Wide Human splice sites (GWH) and a dataset provided at the Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence winter school 2018 (DLAI). The donor sites were also used to test on the HSplice tool to evaluate the predictive models. To improve the effectiveness of predictive models, two datasets were combined. The CNN model with four convolutional layers showed the best splice site prediction performance with an AUPRC of 93.4% and 88.8% for donor and acceptor sites, respectively. The effects of variants on splicing were estimated by applying the best model on variant data from the ClinVar database. Based on the estimation, the framework could effectively differentiate pathogenic variants from the benign variants (p\u00a0=\u00a05.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-7). These promising results support that the proposed framework could be applied in future genetic studies to identify disease causing loci involving the splicing mechanism. The datasets and Python scripts used in this study are available on the GitHub repository at https://github.com/smiile8888/rna-splice-sites-recognition.", "A B S T R A C T Important progress has been made in the development of risk assessment models (RAM) for the identification of outpatients on anticancer treatment at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Since the breakthrough publication of the original Khorana risk score (KRS) more than 10 years ago, a new generation of KRS-based scores have been developed, including the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study, PROTECHT, CONKO, ONCOTEV, TicOnco and the CATS/MICA score. Among these the CATS/MICA score showed that a simplified score composed of only two calibrated predictors, the type of cancer and the D-dimer levels, offers a user-friendly tool for the evaluation of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) risk. The COMPASS-CAT score is the first that introduced a more synthetic approach of risk evaluation by combining cancer-related predictors with patient comorbidity in a score which is designed for the types of cancer frequently seen in the community (i.e. breast, lung colon or ovarian cancers) and has been externally validated in independent studies. The Throly score is registered as part of the same group as it has a similar structure to the COMPASS-CAT score and is applicable in patients with lymphoma. The incorporation of specific biomarkers of hypercoagulability to the RAM for CAT offers the possibility to perform a precision medicine approach in the prevention of CAT. The improvement of RAM for CAT with artificial intelligence methodologies and deep learning techniques is the challenge in the near future.", "Competitive intelligence (CI) has attracted much attention in innovation research, but most of existing literature studies CI in technological innovations in manufacturing industry, with little empirical research in context of service businesses. This paper first analyzes CI of service businesses and then uses covariance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) on a data of 333 got from the survey in tourism enterprises of east China to test the effect of customer CI, opponent CI, and supplier CI on service innovations in China's service industry. Results show that opponent CI and supplier CI have positive influence on both exploratory and exploitative service innovation. Customer CI has more obvious positive influence on exploratory service innovation than on exploitative service innovation.", "[Formula: see text]There is a growing desire amongst space-faring nations to venture beyond the Van Allen radiation belts to a variety of intriguing locations in our inner solar system. Mars is the ultimate destination. In two decades, we hope to vicariously share in the adventure of an intrepid crew of international astronauts on the first voyage to the red planet.This will be a daunting mission with an operational profile unlike anything astronauts have flown before. A flight to Mars will be a 50-million-kilometre journey. Interplanetary distances are so great that voice and data communications between mission control on Earth and a base on Mars will feature latencies up to 20\u2009min. Consequently, the ground support team will not have real-time control of the systems aboard the transit spacecraft nor the surface habitat. As cargo resupply from Earth will be impossible, the onboard inventory of equipment and supplies must be planned strategically in advance. Furthermore, the size, amount, and function of onboard equipment will be constrained by limited volume, mass, and power allowances.With less oversight from the ground, all vehicle systems will need to be reliable and robust. They must function autonomously. Astronauts will rely on their own abilities and onboard resources to deal with urgent situations that will inevitably arise.The deep space environment is hazardous. Zero- and reduced-gravity effects will trigger deconditioning of the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and other physiological systems. While living for 2.5 years in extreme isolation, Mars crews will experience psychological stressors such as loss of privacy, reduced comforts of living, and distant relationships with family members and friends.Beyond Earth's protective magnetosphere, the fluence of ionising radiation will be higher. Longer exposure of astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation could result in the formation of cataracts, impaired wound healing, and degenerative tissue diseases. Genetic mutations and the onset of cancer later in life are also possible. Acute radiation sickness and even death could ensue from a large and unpredictable solar particle event.There are many technological barriers that prevent us from carrying out a mission to Mars today. Before launching the first crew, we will need to develop processes for in-situ resource utilisation. Rather than bringing along large quantities of oxygen, water, and propellant from Earth, future astronauts will need to produce some of these consumables from local space-based resources.Ion propulsion systems will be needed to reduce travel times to interplanetary destinations, and we will need systems to land larger payloads (up to 40 tonnes of equipment and supplies for a human mission) on planetary surfaces. These and other innovations will be needed before humans venture into deep space.However, it is the delivery of health care that is regarded as one of the most important obstacles to be overcome. Physicians, biomedical engineers, human factors specialists, and radiation experts are re-thinking operational concepts of health care, crew performance, and life support. Traditional oversight of astronaut health by ground-based medical teams will no longer be possible, particularly in urgent situations. Aborting a deep space mission to medically evacuate an ill or injured crew member to Earth will not be an option. Future crews must have all of the capability and responsibility to monitor and manage their own health. Onboard medical resources must include imaging, surgery, and emergency care, as well as laboratory analysis of blood, urine, and other biospecimens.At least one member of the crew should be a broadly trained physician with experience in remote medicine. She/he will be supported by an onboard health informatics network that is artificial intelligence enabled to assist with monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment. In other words, health care in deep space will become more autonomous, intelligent, and point of care.The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has dedicated a day of its 5th International Symposium in Adelaide to the theme of Mars exploration. ICRP has brought global experts together today to consider the pressing issues of radiation protection. There are many issues to be addressed: Can the radiation countermeasures currently used in low Earth orbit be adapted for deep space?Can materials of low atomic weight be integrated into the structure of deep space vehicles to shield the crew?In the event of a major solar particle event, could a safe haven shelter the crew adequately from high doses of radiation?Could Martian regolith be used as shielding material for subterranean habitats?Will shielding alone be sufficient to minimise exposure, or will biological and pharmacological countermeasures also be needed?Beyond this symposium, I will value the continued involvement of ICRP in space exploration. ICRP has recently established Task Group 115 to examine radiation effects on the health of astronaut crew and to recommend exposure limits. This work will be vital. Biological effects of radiation could not only impact the health, well-being, and performance of future explorers, but also the length and quality of their lives.While humanity has dreamed of travel to the red planet for decades, an actual mission is finally starting to feel like a possibility. How exciting! I thank ICRP for its ongoing work to protect radiation workers on Earth. In the future, we will depend on counsel from ICRP to protect extraterrestrial workers and to enable the exploration of deep space.", "During the last decade, a dramatic rise in the development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for use in pathology services has occurred. This trend is often expected to continue and reshape the field of pathology in the coming years. The deployment of computational pathology and applications of AI tools can be considered as a paradigm shift that will change pathology services, making them more efficient and capable of meeting the needs of this era of precision medicine. Despite the success of AI models, the translational process from discovery to clinical applications has been slow. The gap between self-contained research and clinical environment may be too wide and has been largely neglected. In this review, we cover the current and prospective applications of AI in pathology. We examine its applications in diagnosis and prognosis, and we offer insights for considerations that could improve clinical applicability of these tools. Then, we discuss its potential to improve workflow efficiency, and its benefits in pathologist education. Finally, we review the factors that could influence adoption in clinical practices and the associated regulatory processes.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field involving computational simulation of human intelligence processes; these applications of deep learning could have implications in the specialty of emergency surgery (ES). ES is a rapidly advancing area, and this review will outline the most recent advances.\nA literature search encompassing the uses of AI in surgery was conducted across large databases (Pubmed, OVID, SCOPUS). Two doctors (LR, CH) both collated relevant papers and appraised them. Papers included were published within the last 5\u00a0years, and a \"snowball effect\" used to collate further relevant literature.\nAI has been shown to provide value in predicting surgical outcomes and giving personalised patient risks based on inputted data. Further to this, image recognition technology within AI has showed success in fracture identification and breast cancer diagnosis. Regarding theatre presence, supervised robots have carried out suturing and anastomosis of bowel in controlled environments to a high standard.\nAI has potential for integration across surgical services, from diagnosis to treatment, and aiding the surgeon in key decision-making for risks per patient. Fully automated surgery may be the future, but at present, AI needs human supervision.", "Brain-inspired computation that mimics the coordinated functioning of neural networks through multitudes of synaptic connections is deemed to be the future of computation to overcome the classical von Neumann bottleneck. The future artificial intelligence circuits require scalable electronic synapse (e-synapses) with very high bit densities and operational speeds. In this respect, nanostructures of two-dimensional materials serve the purpose and offer the scalability of the devices in lateral and vertical dimensions. In this work, we report the nonvolatile bipolar resistive switching and neuromorphic behavior of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) quantum dots (QD) synthesized using liquid-phase exfoliation method. The ReRAM devices exhibit good resistive switching with an On-Off ratio of 104, with excellent endurance and data retention at a smaller read voltage as compared to the existing MoS2 based memory devices. Besides, we have demonstrated the e-synapse based on MoS2 QD. Similar to our biological synapse, Paired Pulse Facilitation / Depression of short-term memory has been observed in these MoS2 QD based e-synapse devices. This work suggests that MoS2 QD has potential applications in ultra-high-density storage as well as artificial intelligence circuitry in a cost-effective way.", "Despite there is a wide range of antidepressants available, with various mechanisms of actions, the efficacy of current therapeutic options is yet satisfactory. Previous shreds of evidence have indicated that genetics, cognitive, neuroendocrine, as well as personality factors, are all intrinsically linked and contribute to the diversity of treatment outcomes. We, therefore, sought to investigate this hypothesis in this study.\nBased on 610 samples treated with a selection of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) or tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), we compared the therapeutic effects of these four classes of drugs by survival analyses. Pharmacogenomic and survival analyses were carried out to explore the hereditary factors for curative effect and the accumulation of genetic factors was further discussed through pathway analysis and the global test. We built a machine learning-based prediction model that integrates genetic and non-genetic factors (including cognition, endocrinology, personality intelligence) to distinguish drug efficacy in single class drug situations. The values of the non-genetic makers after 6\u00a0weeks' treatment were collected to evaluate the efficacy of the model.\nOur results from the 6-week antidepressant therapeutic study indicated that SSRI and SNRI are better treatments than those of TCA and NaSSA in the Chinese population. Among all possible paired single-agent survival analyses, citalopram and venlafaxine were more effective than mirtazapine. Allele C carriers at rs6354 (SLC6A4) and allele G carriers at rs12150214 (SLC6A4) were significantly prone to poorer treatment response to fluoxetine. Besides, the combination of three loci (rs929377-rs6191-rs32897) located in HPA pathway was significantly associated with the treatment outcome of fluoxetine. In female MDD patients, the minor allele of rs6323 and rs1137070 on the MAOA gene likely lead to a worse response to venlafaxine. Furthermore, genetic variants linked to drug efficacy tended to concentrate on the neurotrophin pathway in depressed patients comorbid with anxiety. From multivariate models, more severe cognitive deficits, psychopathic personality and lower levels of operational intelligence, and higher levels of cortisol predicted worse response status with SSRI or SNRI after 6-week treatment. Notably, genetic factors in the multi-dimensional prediction model for both classes of drugs include loci in HTR2A and CRHBP genes.\nSSRI and SNRI are more suitable for the treatment of Chinese people with depression. SLC6A4 genetic variants, as well as HPA pathway, play an important role in the fluoxetine antidepressant therapeutic response while the polymorphism of MAOA gene involved in the pharmacological action of venlafaxine among female MDD patients. The presence of anxiety in MDD patients was related to the neurotrophin pathway. Genetic, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and personality intelligence factors combined have an ensemble impact on the medication effect of patients with major depression, leading to more precise and personalized medicine for specific groups of people.", "Technical improvements in imaging equipment and availability of radiotracers, such as PSMA-ligands have increased the synergy between Urology and Nuclear Medicine. Meanwhile artificial intelligence is introduced in Nuclear Imaging. This review will give an overview of recent technical and clinical developments and an outlook on application of these in the near future.\nDigital PET/CT has shown gradual improvement in lesion detection and demarcation over conventional PET/CT, but total-body PET/CT holds promise for a magnitude of improvement in scan duration and quality, quantification, and dose optimization. PET-guided decision-making with the application of PSMA-ligands has been shown useful in demonstrating and biopting primary prostate cancer (PCa) lesions, guiding radiotherapy, guiding surgical resection of recurrent PCa, and assessing therapy response in PCa. Artificial intelligence made its way into Nuclear Imaging just recently, but encouraging progress promises clinical application with unprecedented possibilities.\nEvidence is growing on clinical usefulness of PET-guided decision-making with the still relatively new PSMA ligands as a prime example. Rapid evolution of PET instrumentation and clinical introduction of artificial intelligence will be the gamechangers of nuclear imaging in the near future, though its powers should still be mastered and incorporated in clinical practice.", "Forensic DNA Phenotyping (FDP) is a set of techniques that aim to infer externally visible characteristics in humans - such as eye, hair and skin color - and biogeographical ancestry of an unknown person, based on biological material. FDP has been applied in various jurisdictions in a limited number of high-profile cases to provide intelligence for criminal investigations. There are on-going controversies about the reliability and validity of FDP, which come together with debates about the ethical challenges emerging from the use of this technology in the criminal justice system. Our study explores how, in the context of complex politics of legitimation of and contestation over the use of FDP, forensic geneticists in Europe perceive this technology's potential applications, utility and risks. Forensic geneticists perform several forms of discursive boundary work, making distinctions between science and the criminal justice system, experts and non-experts, and good and bad science. Such forms of boundary work reconstruct the complex positioning vis-\u00e0-vis legal and scientific realities. In particular, while mobilizing interest in FDP, forensic geneticists simultaneously carve out notions of risk, accountability and scientific conduct that perform distance from FDP' implications in the criminal justice system.", "Radiation therapy (RT) is widely used to treat cancer. Technological advances in RT have occurred in the past 30 years. These advances, such as three-dimensional image guidance, intensity modulation, and robotics, created challenges and opportunities for the next breakthrough, in which artificial intelligence (AI) will possibly play important roles. AI will replace certain repetitive and labor-intensive tasks and improve the accuracy and consistency of others, particularly those with increased complexity because of technological advances. The improvement in efficiency and consistency is important to manage the increasing cancer patient burden to the society. Furthermore, AI may provide new functionalities that facilitate satisfactory RT. The functionalities include superior images for real-time intervention and adaptive and personalized RT. AI may effectively synthesize and analyze big data for such purposes. This review describes the RT workflow and identifies areas, including imaging, treatment planning, quality assurance, and outcome prediction, that benefit from AI. This review primarily focuses on deep-learning techniques, although conventional machine-learning techniques are also mentioned.", "The dark triad of personality (DT) comprises three antisocial personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) that are characterized by callousness and the motive to elevate the self while derogating other people. Previous research indicates that the positive relationship between the DT traits and interpersonally deviant behaviors is especially pronounced at high levels of emotional abilities. This has also been referred to as dark Emotional Intelligence (EI). Since prior studies predominantly examined dark EI via trait-approach, the present study targeted at providing evidence for dark EI using a behavioral measure of EI, namely emotion recognition performance. In order to study the robustness and cross-cultural validity of findings, parallel investigations were conducted in Germany and China.\nA total of N = 198 German (age: M = 23.40, SD = 5.88, 130 female) and N = 223 Chinese (age: M = 19.01, SD = 1.06, 105 female) participants took part in an online survey and completed a set of questionnaires in German and Mandarin translations, respectively. DT traits were assessed by means of the Short Dark Triad Scale. As a behavioral measure of emotional abilities, participants completed the Eyes Test for pairs of eyes of Caucasian and Asian models. Moreover, participants filled in the Emotional Manipulation Scale for the assessment of emotionally manipulative tactics.\nEffects were highly gender- and culture-dependent. Among German females, Machiavellianism and narcissism showed the strongest positive associations with emotionally manipulative tactics at high levels of emotion recognition performance. A similar pattern of results was found among German males for psychopathy. None of the effects was observed in the Chinese female or male samples.\nThe present findings indicate that emotional abilities may constitute risk factors with the potential to promote rather than to prevent deviant behaviors especially in samples from Western cultures with pronounced scores on DT personality traits. Limitations and psychometric properties are discussed.", "Covert Human Intelligence Sources (CHIS) provide unique access to criminals and organised crime groups, and their collection of intelligence is vital to understanding England and Wales' threat picture. Rapport is essential to the establishment and maintenance of effective professional relationships between source handlers and their CHIS. Thus, rapport-based interviewing is a fundamental factor to maximising intelligence yield. The present research gained unprecedented access to 105 real-life audio recorded telephone interactions between England and Wales police source handlers and CHIS. This research quantified both the rapport component behaviours (e.g., attention, positivity, and coordination) displayed by the source handler and the intelligence yielded from the CHIS, in order to investigate the frequencies of these rapport components and their relationship to intelligence yield. Overall rapport, attention and coordination significantly correlated with intelligence yield, while positivity did not. Attention was the most frequently used component of rapport, followed by positivity, and then coordination.", "Among the most noteworthy developments in ophthalmology over the last decade has been the emergence of quantifiable high-resolution imaging modalities, which are typically non-invasive, rapid and widely available. Such imaging is of unquestionable utility in the assessment of ocular disease however evidence is also mounting for its role in identifying ocular biomarkers of systemic disease, which we term oculomics. In this review, we highlight our current understanding of how retinal morphology evolves in two leading causes of global morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular disease and dementia. Population-based analyses have demonstrated the predictive value of retinal microvascular indices, as measured through fundus photography, in screening for heart attack and stroke. Similarly, the association between the structure of the neurosensory retina and prevalent neurodegenerative disease, in particular Alzheimer's disease, is now well-established. Given the growing size and complexity of emerging multimodal datasets, modern artificial intelligence techniques, such as deep learning, may provide the optimal opportunity to further characterize these associations, enhance our understanding of eye-body relationships and secure novel scalable approaches to the risk stratification of chronic complex disorders of ageing.", "Autism is a condition frequently characterized by social and communication challenges. Because most research focuses on understanding and reducing challenges, less is known about the strengths of autistic individuals. This is especially true of those who are transitioning into adulthood. We designed this research study to provide information about how parents perceive the strengths of their autistic adolescent children prior to the transition. We reviewed 39 parent interviews from previous research about how they prepare their autistic sons and daughters for adulthood. Without prompting, parents identified many strengths of their autistic children. Diverse strengths and skills they identified included intelligence, creativity, physical abilities, and self-care skills. These strengths are interesting, as they cover traits that are often thought of as areas of difficulty for autistic youth. However, parents also talked about strengths alongside challenges, and how specific supports would be needed to help their sons and daughters fully realize their strengths. These findings are important, as they help us know more about the strengths of autistic youth and how strengths can be supported when preparing for adulthood. Our findings also help reveal strengths that are particularly apparent during the transition to adulthood.", "Synthetic gene circuits allow programming in DNA the expression of a phenotype at a given environmental condition. The recent integration of memory systems with gene circuits opens the door to their adaptation to new conditions and their re-programming. This lays the foundation to emulate neuromorphic behaviour and solve complex problems similarly to artificial neural networks. Cellular products such as DNA or proteins can be used to store memory in both digital and analog formats, allowing cells to be turned into living computing devices able to record information regarding their previous states. In particular, synthetic gene circuits with memory can be engineered into living systems to allow their adaptation through reinforcement learning. The development of gene circuits able to adapt through reinforcement learning moves Sciences towards the ambitious goal: the bottom-up creation of a fully fledged living artificial intelligence.", "Computer-assisted tissue imaging and analytical techniques were used to clarify the histomorphological structure of hepatic connective tissue as a practical guide for surgeons.\nApproximately 5000 histological slides were prepared from liver specimens of five autopsied patients. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was performed and subjected to computer imaging analysis. Scanning electron microscopy was also performed on the liver specimens.\nThe 3D reconstructed images revealed the running form of the vasculature and the relationship between the hepatic lobule and connective tissue. The hepatic capsule or portal pedicle was consistently located at the periphery of the hepatic lobules. An artificial intelligence random forest approach clearly segmented hepatic cells, type I collagen (CF), type III collagen (RF), and other cells. The hepatic lobule, portal region, and hepatic capsule were significantly distinguished based on CF and RF occupancy. The capsule directly covering the liver lobule with an RF concentration up to 87% was provisionally named the proper hepatic capsule. The existence of a proper hepatic ligament with distinct occupation rates of CF and RF was also suggested.\nThe identified proper hepatic capsule and ligament can be important markers for demarcating the dissecting layer during surgical procedures.", "In the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics, the term \"autonomy\" is generally used to mean the capacity of an artificial agent to operate independently of human guidance. It is thereby assumed that the agent has a fixed goal or \"utility function\" with respect to which the appropriateness of its actions will be evaluated. From a philosophical perspective, this notion of autonomy seems oddly weak. For, in philosophy, the term is generally used to refer to a stronger capacity, namely the capacity to \"give oneself the law,\" to decide by oneself what one's goal or principle of action will be. The predominant view in the literature on the long-term prospects and risks of artificial intelligence is that an artificial agent cannot exhibit such autonomy because it cannot rationally change its own final goal, since changing the final goal is counterproductive with respect to that goal and hence undesirable. The aim of this paper is to challenge this view by showing that it is based on questionable assumptions about the nature of goals and values. I argue that a general AI may very well come to modify its final goal in the course of developing its understanding of the world. This has important implications for how we are to assess the long-term prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.", "Emerging scientific evidence indicates that frequent digital technology use has a significant impact-both negative and positive-on brain function and behavior. Potential harmful effects of extensive screen time and technology use include heightened attention-deficit symptoms, impaired emotional and social intelligence, technology addiction, social isolation, impaired brain development, and disrupted sleep. However, various apps, videogames, and other online tools may benefit brain health. Functional imaging scans show that internet-naive older adults who learn to search online show significant increases in brain neural activity during simulated internet searches. Certain computer programs and videogames may improve memory, multitasking skills, fluid intelligence, and other cognitive abilities. Some apps and digital tools offer mental health interventions providing self-management, monitoring, skills training, and other interventions that may improve mood and behavior. Additional research on the positive and negative brain health effects of technology is needed to elucidate mechanisms and underlying causal relationships.\u2029.\nLa evidencia cient\u00edfica que est\u00e1 surgiendo muestra que el empleo frecuente de la tecnolog\u00eda digital tiene un impacto significativo, tanto negativo como positivo, en la funci\u00f3n cerebral y en el comportamiento.

Therefore, when assessing potential blood donor exposure to EIDs, the use of general population characteristics, such as U.S. travel statistics, may invoke uncertainties that result in inaccurate estimates of blood donor exposure. This may, in turn, lead to the creation of donor deferral policies that do not match actual risk.\nThis article reports on the development of a system to rapidly assess EID risks for a nationally representative portion of the U.S. blood donor population. To assess the effectiveness of this system, a test survey was developed and deployed to a statistically representative sample frame of blood donors from five blood collecting organizations. Donors were directed to an online survey to ascertain their recent travel and potential exposure to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).\nA total of 7128 responses were received from 54\u2009256 invitations. The age-adjusted estimated total number of blood donors potentially exposed to MERS-CoV was approximately 15\u2009640 blood donors compared to a lower U.S. general population-based estimate of 9610 blood donors.\nThe structured donor demographic sample-based data provided an assessment of blood donors' potential exposure to an emerging pathogen that was 63% larger than the U.S. population-based estimate. This illustrates the need for tailored blood donor-based EID risk assessments that provide more specific demographic risk intelligence and can inform appropriate regulatory decision making.", "Geary (2018, 2019) suggested that heritable and environmentally caused differences in mitochondrial functioning affect the integrity and efficiency of neurons and supporting glia cells and may thus contribute to individual differences in higher-order cognitive functioning and physical health. In our comment, we want to pose three questions aimed at different aspects of Geary's theory that critically evaluate his theory in the light of evidence from neurocognitive, cognitive enhancement, and behavioral genetics research. We question (1) if Geary's theory explains why certain cognitive processes show a stronger age-related decline than others; (2) if intervention studies in healthy younger adults support the claim that variation in mitochondrial functioning underlies variation in human intelligence; and (3) if predictions arising from the matrilineal heredity of mitochondrial DNA are supported by behavioral genetics research. We come to the conclusion that there are likely many more biological and social factors contributing to variation in human intelligence than mitochondrial functioning.", "The three-dimensional automated breast ultrasound system (3D ABUS) is a new device which represents a huge innovation in the breast ultrasound field, with several application scenarios of great interest. ABUS's aim is to solve some of the main defects of traditional ultrasound, such as lack of standardization, high level of skill non-reproducibility, small field of view and high commitment of physician time. ABUS has proven to be an excellent non-ionising alternative to other supplemental screening options for women with dense breast tissue; also, it has appeared to be very promising in daily clinical practice. The purpose of this paper is to present a summary of current applications of ABUS, focusing on clinical applications and future perspectives as ABUS is particularly promising for studies involving artificial intelligence, radiomics and evaluation of breast molecular subtypes.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and wearable sensors are two essential fields to realize the goal of tailoring the best precision medicine treatment for individual patients. Integration of these two fields enables better acquisition of patient data and improved design of wearable sensors for monitoring the wearers' health, fitness and their surroundings. Currently, as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data and big health move from concept to implementation, AI-biosensors with appropriate technical characteristics are facing new opportunities and challenges. In this paper, the most advanced progress made in the key phases for future wearable and implantable technology from biosensing, wearable biosensing to AI-biosensing is summarized. Without a doubt, material innovation, biorecognition element, signal acquisition and transportation, data processing and intelligence decision system are the most important parts, which are the main focus of the discussion. The challenges and opportunities of AI-biosensors moving forward toward future medicine devices are also discussed.", "The aim of this work is to combine radiological and pathological information of tumor to develop a signature for pretreatment prediction of discrepancies of pathological response at several centers and restage patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) for individualized treatment planning.\nA total of 981 consecutive patients with evaluation of response according to tumor regression grade (TRG) who received nCRT were retrospectively recruited from four hospitals (primary cohort and external validation cohort 1-3); both pretreatment multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) and whole slide image (WSI) of biopsy specimens were available for each patient. Quantitative image features were extracted from mp-MRI and WSI and used to construct a radiopathomics signature (RPS) powered by an artificial-intelligence model. Models based on mp-MRI or WSI alone were also constructed for comparison.\nThe RPS showed overall accuracy of 79.66-87.66% in validation cohorts. The areas under the curve of RPS at specific response grades were 0.98 (TRG0), 0.93 (\u2264\u2009TRG1), and 0.84 (\u2264\u2009TRG2). RPS at each grade of pathological response revealed significant improvement compared with both signatures constructed without combining multiscale tumor information (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Moreover, RPS showed relevance to distinct probabilities of overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with LARC who underwent nCRT (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\nThe results of this study suggest that radiopathomics, combining both radiological information of the whole tumor and pathological information of local lesions from biopsy, could potentially predict discrepancies of pathological response prior to nCRT for better treatment planning.", "The aim of this study was to build a SVM classifier using ResNet-3D algorithm by artificial intelligence for prediction of synchronous PC.\nAdequate detection and staging of PC from CRC remain difficult.\nThe primary tumors in synchronous PC were delineated on preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images. The features of adjacent peritoneum were extracted to build a ResNet3D + SVM classifier. The performance of ResNet3D + SVM classifier was evaluated in the test set and was compared to routine CT which was evaluated by radiologists.\nThe training set consisted of 19,814 images from 54 patients with PC and 76 patients without PC. The test set consisted of 7837 images from 40 test patients. The ResNet-3D spent only 34\u200aseconds to analyze the test images. To increase the accuracy of PC detection, we have built a SVM classifier by integrating ResNet-3D features with twelve PC-specific features (P < 0.05). The ResNet3D + SVM classifier showed accuracy of 94.11% with AUC of 0.922 (0.912-0.944), sensitivity of 93.75%, specificity of 94.44%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 93.75%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.44% in the test set. The performance was superior to routine contrast-enhanced CT (AUC: 0.791).\nThe ResNet3D + SVM classifier based on deep learning algorithm using ResNet-3D framework has shown great potential in prediction of synchronous PC in CRC.", "The present work illustrates the promising intervention of smart diagnostics devices through artificial intelligence (AI) and mechanobiological approaches in health care practices. The artificial intelligence and mechanobiological approaches in diagnostics widen the scope for point of care techniques for the timely revealing of diseases by understanding the biomechanical properties of the tissue of interest. Smart diagnostic device senses the physical parameters due to change in mechanical, biological, and luidic properties of the cells and to control these changes, supply the necessary drugs immediately using AI techniques. The latest techniques like sweat diagnostics to measure the overall health, Photoplethysmography (PPG) for real-time monitoring of pulse waveform by capturing the reflected signal due to blood pulsation), Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and Nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS) smart devices to detect disease at its early stage, lab-on-chip and organ-on-chip technologies, Ambulatory Circadian Monitoring device (ACM), a wrist-worn device for Parkinson's disease have been discussed. The recent and futuristic smart diagnostics tool/techniques like emotion recognition by applying machine learning algorithms, atomic force microscopy that measures the fibrinogen and erythrocytes binding force, smartphone-based retinal image analyser system, image-based computational modeling for various neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, tuberculosis, predicting and preventing of Zika virus, optimal drugs and doses for HIV using AI, etc. have been reviewed. The objective of this review is to examine smart diagnostics devices based on artificial intelligence and mechanobiological approaches, with their medical applications in healthcare. This review determines that smart diagnostics devices have potential applications in healthcare, but more research work will be essential for prospective accomplishments of this technology.", "Recent studies have shown that subjective memory is multi-, rather than uni-dimensional, in line with the results of objective memory tests. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between aspects of memory measured by the subjective Meta-Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) and aspects of memory measured by the objective Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III) tests in cognitively normal older adults.\nThe study subjects (n\u2009=\u2009106) were cognitively normal, were aged 57-89\u2009years and had participated in the third wave of the North-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health survey (HUNT3). All subjects had completed the MMQ, the WMS-III and the WAIS-III. Previous results from the MMQ (measured as the total MMQ score; the Component I score, related to long-term explicit declarative memory; and the Component II score, related to working/short-term memory) were compared with objective results from WMS-III (Logical Memory) and WAIS-III (Vocabulary and Letter-Number Sequencing) subtests. We conducted linear regression analyses with each objective memory test result as the dependent variable, and subjective memory measures and demographics as independent variables, as well as analyses of MMQ items vs. objective memory.\nSubjective working memory impairment (Component II) was significant related to poor performance in objective episodic memory, according to correlation and regression analyses with demographic covariates. In contrast, ratings of impaired subjective declarative memory (Component I) were not related to poor objective memory performance.\nSpecific aspects of subjective memory related differentially to performance in specific objective memory tests. Clinicians and researchers might consider targeting working memory aspects of subjective memory tests, when seeking an estimate of objective memory performance.", "Previous research has highlighted the connection between emotional intelligence (EI) and work performance. However, the role of job burnout in this context remains relatively unexplored. This study aimed to examine the mediator role of burnout in the relationship between EI and work performance in a multioccupational sample of 1197 Spanish professionals (58.6% women). The participants completed the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire. As expected, the results demonstrated a positive relationship between EI and performance, and a negative relationship with burnout, which has a mediator effect in the relationship between EI and work performance. Professionals with high levels of IE and low burnout reported the highest performance. Multiple mediation analyses showed that employees' EI was indirectly connected to work performance via professional efficacy and exhaustion, even when controlling the effects of sociodemographic variables. The same pattern was found when multiple mediations were conducted for each EI dimension. These findings demonstrate the importance of burnout in understanding work performance and emphasize the role of EI as a protective variable which can prevent the development or chronic progression of workers' burnout.", "Since the 21st century, with the development of minimally invasive surgical technology, the update of comprehensive treatment strategies and the progress of clinical research, colorectal surgery has developed rapidly. However, in recent years, some disputable issues still exist in colorectal surgery, such as transanal total mesorectal excision, pelvic cavity lateral lymph node dissection, the \"wait and observe\" strategy for clinical complete remission of rectal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy, and robotic colorectal surgical operation. In addition, the application of three dimensions imaging, 4K resolution, 5th generation wireless systems, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and other new techniques may provide extensive space and new opportunity for the development of colorectal surgery. The therapic outcome could be optimized by more relevant clinical research and evidence, which contribute to the standardization of surgical treatment of colorectal cancer.\n21\u4e16\u7eaa\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5fae\u521b\u5916\u79d1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u7efc\u5408\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u5916\u79d1\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8fc5\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u7ecf\u809b\u5168\u76f4\u80a0\u7cfb\u819c\u5207\u9664\u3001\u76c6\u8154\u4fa7\u65b9\u6dcb\u5df4\u7ed3\u6e05\u626b\u3001\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u65b0\u8f85\u52a9\u6cbb\u7597\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b8c\u5168\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\"\u7b49\u5f85\u89c2\u5bdf\"\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u5916\u79d1\u624b\u672f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u5916\u79d1\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e09\u7ef4\u6210\u50cf\u30014K\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u7b2c5\u4ee3\u79fb\u52a8\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u3001\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u65b0\u79d1\u6280\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e5f\u7ed9\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u5916\u79d1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5d2d\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u9047\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u5c55\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5faa\u8bc1\u533b\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u7684\u5916\u79d1\u6cbb\u7597\u66f4\u52a0\u89c4\u8303\u5316\uff0c\u624d\u662f\u5207\u5b9e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u5916\u79d1\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u7684\u6839\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002.", "Mathematics is often promoted as endowing those who study it with transferable skills such as an ability to think logically and critically or to have improved investigative skills, resourcefulness and creativity in problem solving. However, there is scant evidence to back up such claims. This project tested participants with increasing levels of mathematics training on 11 well-studied rational and logical reasoning tasks aggregated from various psychological studies. These tasks, that included the Cognitive Reflection Test and the Wason Selection Task, are of particular interest as they have typically and reliably eluded participants in all studies, and results have been uncorrelated with general intelligence, education levels and other demographic information. The results in this study revealed that in general the greater the mathematics training of the participant, the more tasks were completed correctly, and that performance on some tasks was also associated with performance on others not traditionally associated. A ceiling effect also emerged. The work is deconstructed from the viewpoint of adding to the platform from which to approach the greater, and more scientifically elusive, question: are any skills associated with mathematics training innate or do they arise from skills transfer?", "To investigate the effects of infant feeding mode on childhood cognition and language as the differential effects of infant feeding on development remain understudied.\nBreastfed [BF, 174], cow's milk-based formula-fed [MF, 169], or soy protein-based formula-fed [SF, 161] children were longitudinally tested from age 3 to 60\u00a0months for neurodevelopment. Data were analyzed using mixed models while adjusting for multiple covariates. Sex differences were also assessed.\nStandard scores were within established norms for all groups. There were no differences in mental development to age 24\u00a0months, yet BF children had significantly higher motor development scores at age 3\u00a0months than SF children (99.1 versus. 97.2). BF children had significantly higher composite intelligence scores at 48\u00a0months than MF and SF children (113.4 versus. 109.6 and 108.4, respectively) and higher verbal intelligence scores than SF children at 48 (105.6 versus. 100.7) and 60\u00a0months (109.8 versus. 105.9). Greater total language scores at ages 36 and 48\u00a0months were found in BF children compared with children fed MF or SF (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), with differences between sexes for auditory comprehension. Higher total language scores at age 60\u00a0months were found between BF and SF (105.0 versus. 100.1).\nBreastfeeding was associated with small, statistically significant, differences between children ages 3 and 5\u00a0years in verbal intelligence, expressive communication, and auditory comprehension with the latter having potential sexual dimorphic effects. Yet, these differences remain small and may not be of clinical relevance. Overall, MF and SF did not significantly differ.", "The mobile terminals used in the logistics industry can be exposed to wildly varying environments, which may hinder effective operation. In particular, those used in cold storages can be subject to frosting in the scanner window when they are carried out of the warehouses to a room-temperature space outside. To prevent this, they usually employ a film heater on the scanner window. However, the temperature and humidity conditions of the surrounding environment and the temperature of the terminal itself that cause frosting vary widely. Due to the complicated frost-forming conditions, existing industrial mobile terminals choose to implement rather simple rules that operate the film heater well above the freezing point, which inevitably leads to inefficient energy use. This paper demonstrates that to avoid such waste, on-device artificial intelligence (AI) a.k.a. edge AI can be readily employed to industrial mobile terminals and can improve their energy efficiency. We propose an artificial-intelligence-based approach that utilizes deep learning technology to avoid the energy-wasting defrosting operations. By combining the traditional temperature-sensing logic with a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier that visually checks for frost, we can more precisely control the defrosting operation. We embed the CNN classifier in the device and demonstrate that the approach significantly reduces the energy consumption. On our test terminal, the net ratio of the energy consumption by the existing system to that of the edge AI for the heating film is almost 14:1. Even with the common current-dissipation accounted for, our edge AI system would increase the operating hours by 86%, or by more than 6 h compared with the system without the edge AI.", "We describe and contrast the strengths of precision medicine with Western medicine, and complex trait genetics with Mendelian genetics. Classic genetics focuses on highly penetrant pathogenic variants in a single gene believed to cause or confer a high risk for well-defined phenotypes. However, a minority of disorders have a single gene cause. Further, even individuals with identical Mendelian disease-associated genotypes may exhibit substantial phenotypic variability indicative of genetic and environmental modifiers. Still, most diseases are considered complex traits (or complex diseases).\nNew insights into the genetic underpinnings of complex traits provide opportunities for advances in diagnosis and management. Precision medicine provides the framework for integrating complex trait knowledge into clinical care through a sophisticated analysis pipeline. Multidimensional modeling of acquired diseases includes multiple genetic risks scattered over many genes and gene regulators that must be interpreted on the basis of functional evidence (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics) with structured models and expert systems; strengthened with machine learning and artificial intelligence. The choice of genotyping approaches (shotgun sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism chips, targeted panels) is discussed.\nThe result of a good precision medicine tool is clinical-decision support and guidance to tackle complex disorders such as pancreatitis, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer oncogenesis.", "The purpose of this study was to describe the temporal evolution of quantitative lung lesion features on chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with common and severe types of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. Records of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were reviewed retrospectively from 24 January 2020 to 15 March 2020. Patients were classified into common and severe groups according to the diagnostic criteria of severe pneumonia. The quantitative CT features of lung lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, and the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), consolidation volume (PCV) and total lesion volume (PTV) were determined in both lungs. PGV, PCV and PTV were analyzed based on the time from the onset of initial symptoms in the common and severe groups. In the common group, PTV increased slowly and peaked at approximately 12 days from the onset of the initial symptoms. In the severe group, PTV peaked at approximately 17 days. The severe pneumonia group exhibited increased PGV, PCV and PTV compared with the common group. These features started to appear in Stage 2 (4-7 days from onset of initial symptoms) and were observed in all subsequent stages (p<0.05). In severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, PGV, PCV and PTV began to significantly increase in Stage 2 and decrease in Stage 5 (22-30 days). Compared with common SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, the patients in the severe group exhibited increased PGV, PCV and PTV as well as a later peak time of lesion and recovery time.", "Natural phenomena of collective intelligence (CI) occurring in physical space show a potential approach to effective large-scale human collaboration in cyberspace. Based on existing explanatory understanding of CI, this perspective proposes a constructive model for building artificial CI systems, i.e., problem-oriented CI phenomena with AI-powered information integration and feedback.", "Accurate estimation of nutritional information may lead to healthier diets and better clinical outcomes. We propose a dietary assessment system based on artificial intelligence (AI), named goFOODTM. The system can estimate the calorie and macronutrient content of a meal, on the sole basis of food images captured by a smartphone. goFOODTM requires an input of two meal images or a short video. For conventional single-camera smartphones, the images must be captured from two different viewing angles; smartphones equipped with two rear cameras require only a single press of the shutter button. The deep neural networks are used to process the two images and implements food detection, segmentation and recognition, while a 3D reconstruction algorithm estimates the food's volume. Each meal's calorie and macronutrient content is calculated from the food category, volume and the nutrient database. goFOODTM supports 319 fine-grained food categories, and has been validated on two multimedia databases that contain non-standardized and fast food meals. The experimental results demonstrate that goFOODTM performed better than experienced dietitians on the non-standardized meal database, and was comparable to them on the fast food database. goFOODTM provides a simple and efficient solution to the end-user for dietary assessment.", "This manuscript reviews the current state of veterinary medical electronic health records and the ability to aggregate and analyze large datasets from multiple organizations and clinics. We also review analytical techniques as well as research efforts into veterinary informatics with a focus on applications relevant to human and animal medicine. Our goal is to provide references and context for these resources so that researchers can identify resources of interest and translational opportunities to advance the field.\nThis review covers various methods of veterinary informatics including natural language processing and machine learning techniques in brief and various ongoing and future projects. After detailing techniques and sources of data, we describe some of the challenges and opportunities within veterinary informatics as well as providing reviews of common One Health techniques and specific applications that affect both humans and animals.\nCurrent limitations in the field of veterinary informatics include limited sources of training data for developing machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, siloed data between academic institutions, corporate institutions, and many small private practices, and inconsistent data formats that make many integration problems difficult. Despite those limitations, there have been significant advancements in the field in the last few years and continued development of a few, key, large data resources that are available for interested clinicians and researchers. These real-world use cases and applications show current and significant future potential as veterinary informatics grows in importance. Veterinary informatics can forge new possibilities within veterinary medicine and between veterinary medicine, human medicine, and One Health initiatives.", "The Emotional Quotient Inventory: Youth version-EQ-i:YV was developed by Bar-On & Parker in 2000 and later translated and adapted for the general Spanish adolescent population by Ferrandiz et al. in 2012. The Spanish scale presents similar psychometric properties to the original version (54 items and five subdimensions). The Emotional Quotient Inventory assesses a set of personal, emotional, and social skills that influence adaptation to and coping with environmental demands and pressures. These factors can influence an adolescent's success later in life, health, and psychological well-being. Traditionally, research in Down syndrome (DS) has focused on identifying cognitive deficits, relatively little is known about emotional intelligence (EI) and there are no scales that measure EI in people with DS adults.\nTo validate and analyze the psychometric properties of the scale in the clinical population, specifically in Spanish adults with DS (EQ-i: SVDS).\nA cross-sectional investigation was carried out in several stages. Descriptive, exploratory factorial (n = 345), confirmatory (n = 397), and scale reliability analyses were performed with better goodness-of-adjustment indices.\nA new scale named Emotional Quotient Inventory: Short Version for DS adults was obtained with a structure of four factors called mood, stress management, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. This new scale was reduced to 25 items. Goodness-of-fit indices were excellent (RMSEA [95% CI] = 02[.01; .03]; CFI = .99; TLI = .98; GFI = .87; AGFI = .89). The internal consistency of the four dimensions and the calculated total score (\u03b1 = .91, \u03c9 = .93 and divided halves = .90) yielded high values in this clinical sample.\nThe results recommend the use of the revised EQ-i: YV, the EQ-i: SVDS, to assess EI in adults with DS. The psychometric properties of this study are satisfactory but have four factors. The findings are discussed in terms of future research and practical implication to gain a more thorough understanding of how this population behaves on both a general and preventive level in order to teach EI properly.\nThis new version is a valid and reliable tool to evaluate emotional intelligence in people with intellectual disabilities and specifically in Spanish adults with DS.", "Tumor response to therapy is often assessed by measuring change in liver lesion size between consecutive MRIs. However, these evaluations are both tedious and time-consuming for clinical radiologists.\nIn this study, we sought to develop a convolutional neural network to detect liver metastases on MRI and applied this algorithm to assess change in tumor size on consecutive examinations.\nWe annotated a data set of 64 patients with neuroendocrine tumors who underwent at least two consecutive liver MRIs with gadoxetic acid. We then developed a 3-D neural network using a U-Net architecture with ResNet-18 building blocks that first detected the liver and then lesions within the liver. Liver lesion labels for each examination were then matched in 3-D space using an iterative closest point algorithm followed by Kuhn-Munkres algorithm.\nWe developed a deep learning algorithm that detected liver metastases, co-registered the detected lesions, and then assessed the interval change in tumor burden between two multiparametric liver MRI examinations. Our deep learning algorithm was concordant in 91% with the radiologists' manual assessment about the interval change of disease burden. It had a sensitivity of 0.85 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.77; 0.93) and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87; 0.96) to classify liver segments as diseased or healthy. The mean DICE coefficient for individual lesions ranged between 0.73 and 0.81.\nOur algorithm displayed high agreement with human readers for detecting change in liver lesions on MRI, offering evidence that artificial intelligence-based detectors may perform these tasks as part of routine clinical care in the future.", "The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field-Atrial Fibrillation (GARFIELD-AF) examined real-world practice in a total of 57,149 (5069 retrospective, 52,080 prospective) patients with newly diagnosed AF at risk of stroke/systemic embolism, enrolled at over 1000 centers in 35 countries. It aimed to capture data on AF burden, patients' clinical profile, patterns of clinical practice and antithrombotic management, focusing on stroke/systemic embolism prevention, uptake of new oral anticoagulants, impact on death and bleeding. GARFIELD-AF set new standards for quality of data collection and analysis. A total of 36 peer-reviewed articles were already published and 73 abstracts presented at international congresses, covering treatment strategies, geographical variations in baseline risk and therapies, adverse outcomes and common comorbidities such as heart failure.

The aim of this paper is to describe a multi-sensor Internet of Things (IoT) system for agriculture consisting of a soil probe, an air probe and a smart data logger. The implementation details will focus of the integration element and the innovative Artificial Intelligence based gas identification sensor. Furthermore, the paper focuses on the analytics and decision support system implementation that provides farming recommendations and is enhanced with a feedback loop from farmers and a social trust index that will increase the reliability of the system.", "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and insulin depletion. Over 40% of people with T1D manage their glucose through multiple injections of long-acting basal and short-acting bolus insulin, so-called multiple daily injections (MDI)1,2. Errors in dosing can lead to life-threatening hypoglycaemia events (<70\u2009mg\u2009dl-1) and hyperglycaemia (>180\u2009mg\u2009dl-1), increasing the risk of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Machine learning (artificial intelligence) approaches are being harnessed to incorporate decision support into many medical specialties. Here, we report an algorithm that provides weekly insulin dosage recommendations to adults with T1D using MDI therapy. We employ a unique virtual platform3 to generate over 50,000 glucose observations to train a k-nearest neighbours4 decision support system (KNN-DSS) to identify causes of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia and determine necessary insulin adjustments from a set of 12 potential recommendations. The KNN-DSS algorithm achieves an overall agreement with board-certified endocrinologists of 67.9% when validated on real-world human data, and delivers safe recommendations, per endocrinologist review. A comparison of inter-physician-recommended adjustments to insulin pump therapy indicates full agreement of 41.2% among endocrinologists, which is consistent with previous measures of inter-physician agreement (41-45%)5. In silico3,6 benchmarking using a platform accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration for evaluation of artificial pancreas technologies indicates substantial improvement in glycaemic outcomes after 12 weeks of KNN-DSS use. Our data indicate that the KNN-DSS allows for early identification of dangerous insulin regimens and may be used to improve glycaemic outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications in people with T1D.", "The implementation of neural network regression prediction based on digital circuits is one of the challenging problems in the field of machine learning and cognitive recognition, and it is also an effective way to relieve the pressure of the Internet in the era of intelligence. As a nonlinear network, the stochastic configuration network (SCN) is considered to be an effective method for regression prediction due to its good performance in learning and generalization. Therefore, in this paper, we adapt the SCN to regression analysis, and design and verify the field programmable gate array (FPGA) framework to implement SCN model for the first time. In addition, in order to improve the performance of the SCN model based on the FPGA, the implementation of the nonlinear activation function on the FPGA is optimized, which effectively improves the prediction accuracy while considering the utilization rate of hardware resources. Experimental results based on the simulation data set and the real data set prove that the proposed FPGA framework successfully implements the SCN regression prediction model, and the improved SCN model has higher accuracy and a more stable performance. Compared with the extreme learning machine (ELM), the prediction performance of the proposed SCN implementation model based on the FPGA for the simulation data set and the real data set is improved by 56.37% and 17.35%, respectively.", "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) involves arterial blockages in the body, except those serving the heart and brain. We explore the relationship of functional limitation and PAD symptoms obtained from a quality-of-life questionnaire about the severity of the disease. We used a supervised artificial intelligence-based method of data analyses known as machine learning (ML) to demonstrate a nonlinear relationship between symptoms and functional limitation amongst patients with and without PAD.\nThis paper will demonstrate the use of machine learning to explore the relationship between functional limitation and symptom severity to PAD severity.\nWe performed supervised machine learning and graphical analysis, analyzing 703 patients from an administrative database with data comprising the toe-brachial index (TBI), baseline demographics and symptom score(s) derived from a modified vascular quality-of-life questionnaire, calf circumference in centimeters and a six-minute walk (distance in meters).\nGraphical analysis upon categorizing patients into critical limb ischemia (CLI), severe PAD, moderate PAD and no PAD demonstrated a decrease in walking distance as symptoms worsened and the relationship appeared nonlinear. A supervised ML ensemble (random forest, neural network, generalized linear model) found symptom score, calf circumference (cm), age in years, and six-minute walk (distance in meters) to be important variables to predict PAD. Graphical analysis of a six-minute walk distance against each of the other variables categorized by PAD status showed nonlinear relationships. For low symptom scores, a six-minute walk test (6MWT) demonstrated high specificity for PAD.\nPAD patients with the greatest functional limitation may sometimes be asymptomatic. Patients without PAD show no relationship between functional limitation and symptoms. Machine learning allows exploration of nonlinear relationships. A simple linear model alone would have overlooked or considered such a nonlinear relationship unimportant.", "With responsible, safe and successful use of artificial intelligence (AI), possible advantages in the field of dermato-oncology include the following: (1) medical work can focus on skin cancer patients, (2) patients can be more quickly and effectively treated despite the increasing incidence of skin cancer and the decreasing number of actively working dermatologists and (3) users can learn from the AI results. POTENTIAL DISADVANTAGES AND RISKS OF AI USE: (1) Lack of mutual trust can develop due to the decreased patient-physician contact, (2) additional time effort will be necessary to promptly evaluate the AI-classified benign lesions, (3) lack of adequate medical experience to recognize misclassified AI decisions and (4) recontacting a patient in due time in the case of incorrect AI classifications. Still problematic in the use of AI are the medicolegal situation and remuneration. Apps using AI currently cannot provide sufficient assistance based on clinical images of skin cancer.\nSmartphone program applications (apps) can be implemented responsibly when the image quality is good, the patient's history can be entered easily, transmission of the image and results are assured and medicolegal aspects as well as remuneration are clarified. Apps can be used for disease-specific information material and can optimize patient care by using teledermatology.", "It is a known fact that individuals who engaged in delinquent behavior in childhood are more probable to carry on similar behavior in adulthood. If the factors that lead children to involve in delinquency are defined, the risk of dragging children into crime can be detected before they are involved in crime and delinquency can be prevented with appropriate preventive rehabilitation programs, in the early period. However, given that delinquent behavior occurs under the influence of multiple conditions and factors rather than a single risk factor; the need for diagnostic tools to evaluate multiple factors together is obvious. Artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support systems have already been used in the field of psychiatry as well as many other fields of medicine. In this study, we assume that thanks to artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support systems, children and adolescents at risk can be detected before the criminal behavior occurs by addressing certain factors. In this way, we anticipate that it can provide psychiatrists and other experts in the field.", "Three important systems, genes, the brain, and artificial intelligence (especially deep learning) have similar goals, namely, the maximization of likelihood or minimization of cross-entropy. Animal brains have evolved through predator-prey interactions in which maximizing survival probability and transmission of genes to offspring were the main objectives. Coordinate transformation for a rigid body necessary to win predator-prey battles requires a huge amount of matrix operations in the brain similar to those performed by a powerful GPU. Things (molecules), information (genes), and energy (ATP) are essential for using Maxwell's demon model to understand how a living system maintains a low level of entropy. However, while the history of medicine and biology saw molecular biology and genetics disciplines flourish, the study of energy has been limited, despite estimates that >10% all human genes code energy-related proteins. Since there are a large number of molecular and genetic diseases, many energy-related diseases must exist as well. In addition to mitochondrial disease, common diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, muscle diseases, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes are candidates for diseases related to cellular energy shortage. We are developing ATP enhancer, a drug to treat such diseases. I predict that in the future, the frontier of medicine and biology will involve energy and entropy, and the frontier of science will be about the cognitive processes that scientists' brains use to study mathematics and physics. That will be understood by comparing the abilities that were necessary to survive battles between predators and prey during evolutionary history.", "Background There is great interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for use in screening mammography. Comparative performance benchmarks from true screening cohorts are needed. Purpose To determine the range of human first-reader performance measures within a population-based screening cohort of 1 million screening mammograms to gauge the performance of emerging AI CAD systems. Materials and Methods This retrospective study consisted of all screening mammograms in women aged 40-74 years in Stockholm County, Sweden, who underwent screening with full-field digital mammography between 2008 and 2015. There were 110 interpreting radiologists, of whom 24 were defined as high-volume readers (ie, those who interpreted more than 5000 annual screening mammograms). A true-positive finding was defined as the presence of a pathology-confirmed cancer within 12 months. Performance benchmarks included sensitivity and specificity, examined per quartile of radiologists' performance. First-reader sensitivity was determined for each tumor subgroup, overall and by quartile of high-volume reader sensitivity. Screening outcomes were examined based on the first reader's sensitivity quartile with 10\u2009000 screening mammograms per quartile. Linear regression models were fitted to test for a linear trend across quartiles of performance. Results A total of 418\u2009041 women (mean age, 54 years \u00b1 10 [standard deviation]) were included, and 1\u2009186\u2009045 digital mammograms were evaluated, with 972\u2009899 assessed by high-volume readers. Overall sensitivity was 73% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 69%, 77%), and overall specificity was 96% (95% CI: 95%, 97%). The mean values per quartile of high-volume reader performance ranged from 63% to 84% for sensitivity and from 95% to 98% for specificity. The sensitivity difference was very large for basal cancers, with the least sensitive and most sensitive high-volume readers detecting 53% and 89% of cancers, respectively (P < .001). Conclusion Benchmarks showed a wide range of performance differences between high-volume readers. Sensitivity varied by tumor characteristics. \u00a9 RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "Gallium-based liquid metals exhibit excellent locomotion and deformation capabilities under external stimuli and has potential in developing intelligent robots. Programing the locomotion and morphology of the Liquid metal (LM) to endow it with functionalities and intelligence as robots is charming but remains challenging. In this study, we develop a programmable digital LM (PDLM) control platform that can realize versatile locomotion and morphological manipulation of magnetic LM (MLM) droplets using arrays of electromagnets. We demonstrate on-demand transportation, deformation, breakup, and merging of multiple MLM droplets simultaneously and precisely. We find that the intriguing behaviors of MLM under a magnetic field are due to the interplay of surface tension and magnetic forces. Furthermore, we present a functional cooperative droplet robot by equipping the MLM droplets with three-dimensionally printed microtool modules. We show that both the position and orientation of a rod-shaped object can be precisely manipulated by the cooperation of the MLM droplet robots. More interestingly, we explore the capability of the MLM droplet robots for cooperatively handling a copper wire to connect and disconnect electronic circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that the PDLM control platform is capable of programing a group of MLM droplets to accomplish a digital display task. We believe that the PDLM control system presents a promising potential in developing LM-based reconfigurable circuits, digital display systems, and biomimetic soft robotic systems with high controllability, multifunctionalities, and intelligence.", "Accompanying the aging of populations worldwide, and increased survival with chronic diseases, the incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) are rising, justifying the term global epidemic. This multifactorial arrhythmia is intertwined with common concomitant cardiovascular diseases, which share classical cardiovascular risk factors. Targeted prevention programs are largely missing. Prevention needs to start at an early age with primordial interventions at the population level. The public health dimension of AF motivates research in modifiable AF risk factors and improved precision in AF prediction and management. In this review, we summarize current knowledge in an attempt to untangle these multifaceted associations from an epidemiological perspective. We discuss disease trends, preventive opportunities offered by underlying risk factors and concomitant disorders, current developments in diagnosis and risk prediction, and prognostic implications of AF and its complications. Finally, we review current technological (eg, eHealth) and methodological (artificial intelligence) advances and their relevance for future prevention and disease management.", "The burden of large and rare copy number genetic variants (CNVs) as well as certain specific CNVs increase the risk of developing schizophrenia. Several cognitive measures are purported schizophrenia endophenotypes and may represent an intermediate point between genetics and the illness. This paper investigates the influence of CNVs on cognition. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature exploring the effect of CNV burden on general intelligence. We included ten primary studies with a total of 18,847 participants and found no evidence of association. In a new psychosis family study, we investigated the effects of CNVs on specific cognitive abilities. We examined the burden of large and rare CNVs (>200\u2009kb, <1% MAF) as well as known schizophrenia-associated CNVs in patients with psychotic disorders, their unaffected relatives and controls (N\u2009=\u20093428) from the Psychosis Endophenotypes International Consortium (PEIC). The carriers of specific schizophrenia-associated CNVs showed poorer performance than non-carriers in immediate (P\u2009=\u20090.0036) and delayed (P\u2009=\u20090.0115) verbal recall. We found suggestive evidence that carriers of schizophrenia-associated CNVs had poorer block design performance (P\u2009=\u20090.0307). We do not find any association between CNV burden and cognition. Our findings show that the known high-risk CNVs are not only associated with schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders, but are also a contributing factor to impairment in cognitive domains such as memory and perceptual reasoning, and act as intermediate biomarkers of disease risk.", "Digital technology, including its omnipresent connectedness and its powerful artificial intelligence, is the most recent long wave of humanity's socioeconomic evolution. The first technological revolutions go all the way back to the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, when the transformation of material was the driving force in the Schumpeterian process of creative destruction. A second metaparadigm of societal modernization was dedicated to the transformation of energy (aka the \"industrial revolutions\"), including water, steam, electric, and combustion power. The current metaparadigm focuses on the transformation of information. Less than 1% of the world's technologically stored information was in digital format in the late 1980s, surpassing more than 99% by 2012. Every 2.5 to 3 years, humanity is able to store more information than since the beginning of civilization. The current age focuses on algorithms that automate the conversion of data into actionable knowledge. This article reviews the underlying theoretical framework and some accompanying data from the perspective of innovation theory.\u2029.\nLa tecnolog\u00eda digital, que incluye una alt\u00edsima conectividad y una poderosa inteligencia artificial, constituye el desarrollo m\u00e1s reciente y significativo en la evoluci\u00f3n socioecon\u00f3mica de la humanidad.

We show that conservatives are more ideologically intolerant than liberals and that the more intelligent are more ideologically intolerant than the less intelligent. We also show that the differences between liberals and conservatives and the differences between the more and less intelligent depend on ideological extremity: They are larger for extreme than for moderate ideologists. The implication of these results to questions regarding the relationship between intelligence and ideological intolerance and regarding the relationship between ideology and prejudice are discussed.

Nutritional or metabolic stressors during early life, and female sex, are predisposing conditions towards the development of cognitive diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Though there is evidence that breastfeeding may play a beneficial role in children's neurocognitive development, the literature remains controversial. In this study we aimed at assessing the association between exclusive breastfeeding and children's cognitive development from six months to five years of age, addressing sex differences. In 80 mother-child pairs from the Pisa birth cohort (PISAC), we measured cognitive development in groups of children of 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 60 months by Griffiths Mental Development Scales, parents' intelligence quotient (IQ) by Raven's progressive matrices, and maternal and infants' anthropometric parameters. We found that exclusive breastfeeding was associated with higher hearing-language development in five years old girls, independent of maternal IQ, age and BMI (body mass index). Exclusive breastfeeding in the first three months of life seemed sufficient to establish this positive relationship. In conclusion, our data indicate that exclusive breastfeeding is a positive predictor of cognitive development in preschool-age girls, paving the way for the implementation of sex-specific cognitive disease risk detection and prevention strategies from early life. Further studies are warranted to explore causality and longer term effects.", "This conceptual paper describes the current state of mental health services, identifies critical problems, and suggests how to solve them. I focus on the potential contributions of artificial intelligence and precision mental health to improving mental health services. Toward that end, I draw upon my own research, which has changed over the last half century, to highlight the need to transform the way we conduct mental health services research. I identify exemplars from the emerging literature on artificial intelligence and precision approaches to treatment in which there is an attempt to personalize or fit the treatment to the client in order to produce more effective interventions.", "The risk of dementia seems to be established already early in life, which leads to the question if overweight early in life is an important risk factor for dementia as it appears to be later in life. We examined the association between body mass index (BMI) at entry to adult life and subsequent risk of dementia in men and assessed whether the relationship differed by levels of intelligence and education. The study population consisted of 377,598 Danish men born 1939-1959 with measures of height, weight, intelligence test score (ITS), and educational level (EL) at conscript board examinations around the age of 19\u00a0years. Dementia outcomes were obtained from National Patient and Prescription Registries between 1969 and 2016. The association between BMI and dementia was analysed using Cox proportional hazard regression including interactions between BMI and ITS and EL, respectively. During the follow-up through age 77 years, 6144 (1.6%) developed dementia. The frequency was highest in men with lowest BMI, lowest ITS and lowest EL. Young adult BMI below the mean of 21.8\u00a0kg/m2 was inversely associated with subsequent dementia, whereas there was no association with higher levels of BMI. Adjustment for young adult ITS and EL attenuated the risk estimates slightly, and interaction analyses showed that the shape of the association between BMI and dementia was unaffected by the levels of ITS and EL. Regardless of levels of ITS and EL, young adult BMI below the mean is inversely associated with subsequent dementia, whereas there is no association with higher levels of BMI.", "Several studies highlight the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) systems on healthcare delivery. AI-based tools may improve prognosis, diagnostics, and care planning. It is believed that AI will be an integral part of healthcare services in the near future and will be incorporated into several aspects of clinical care. Thus, many technology companies and governmental projects have invested in producing AI-based clinical tools and medical applications. Patients can be one of the most important beneficiaries and users of AI-based applications whose perceptions may affect the widespread use of AI-based tools. Patients should be ensured that they will not be harmed by AI-based devices, and instead, they will be benefited by using AI technology for healthcare purposes. Although AI can enhance healthcare outcomes, possible dimensions of concerns and risks should be addressed before its integration with routine clinical care.\nWe develop a model mainly based on value perceptions due to the specificity of the healthcare field. This study aims at examining the perceived benefits and risks of AI medical devices with clinical decision support (CDS) features from consumers' perspectives. We use an online survey to collect data from 307 individuals in the United States.\nThe proposed model identifies the sources of motivation and pressure for patients in the development of AI-based devices. The results show that technological, ethical (trust factors), and regulatory concerns significantly contribute to the perceived risks of using AI applications in healthcare. Of the three categories, technological concerns (i.e., performance and communication feature) are found to be the most significant predictors of risk beliefs.\nThis study sheds more light on factors affecting perceived risks and proposes some recommendations on how to practically reduce these concerns. The findings of this study provide implications for research and practice in the area of AI-based CDS. Regulatory agencies, in cooperation with healthcare institutions, should establish normative standard and evaluation guidelines for the implementation and use of AI in healthcare. Regular audits and ongoing monitoring and reporting systems can be used to continuously evaluate the safety, quality, transparency, and ethical factors of AI-based services.", "In this perspective, we consider the possible role of the United Nations (UN) with respect to existential risks to human civilization and the survival of humanity. We illustrate how existential risks have been discussed at an international governance level, specifically in documents in the UN Digital Library. In this large corpus, discussions of nuclear war account for over two-thirds (69%, 67/97) of mentions of existential risks, while mention of other existential risks, or such risks as a category, appears scant. We take these observations to imply inadequate attention to these significant threats. These deficits, combined with the need for a global response to many risks, suggest that UN member nations should urgently advocate for appropriate action at the UN to address threats, such as artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, geoengineering, and supervolcanic eruption, in analogous fashion to existing attempts to mitigate the threats from nuclear war or near-Earth objects.", "Previous meta-analyses on neurocognitive test performances in depression have provided effect sizes for cognitive domains. Most domain effect sizes have medium to high variance heterogeneity. Restriction to each test performance could reduce variance and clarify differing test effect sizes. This systematic review and meta-analysis were done to 1. provide effect sizes for cognitive performances (test, subtest, or multiple measures within tests), and 2. investigate age as an effect modifier.\nInclusion criteria were: 1. active major depression episode (MD), 2. a control group, 3 reported means and standard deviations, 4. non-computerized tests previously studied at least 3 times. Meta-analyses were performed using Cochrane Review Manager. Age under versus over 45 was investigated as an effect moderator.\nTwenty-seven studies met criteria. MD patients performed significantly poorer on 16 of 16 neurocognitive measures (random effects d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.47 to -0.92 across tests). Variance was heterogeneous for 11 of 16 measures. Differences between cognitive measures were largely absent based on overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Effect sizes did not differ under versus over 45 years.\nBias risk assessment showed limited control for subject selection, comparability of depressed and control groups, pre-morbid intelligence, drug treatment, and effort in testing.\nThe depression - cognition effect was in the moderate to large range regardless of test type. Variance heterogeneity was substantial despite exclusion of inactive depression and the absence of test pooling. The size of the depression - cognition effect was not a function of age.", "Heart failure (HF) readmission commonly arises owing to insufficient patient knowledge and failure of recognition of the early stages of recurrent fluid congestion. In previous work, we developed a score to predict short-term hospital readmission and showed that higher-risk patients benefit most from a disease management programme (DMP) that included enhancing knowledge and education by a nurse. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, nurse-led HF DMP in selected patients at high risk of short-term hospital readmission, using ultrasound-guided diuretic management and artificial intelligence to enhance HF knowledge in an outpatient setting.\nRisk-HF is a prospective multisite randomized controlled trial that will allocate 404 patients hospitalized with acute decompensated HF, and \u226533% risk of readmission and/or death at 30 days, into risk-guided nurse intervention (DMP-Plus group) compared with usual care. Intervention elements include (i) fluid management with a handheld ultrasound (HHU) device at point of care; (ii) post-discharge follow-up; (iii) optimal programmed drug titration; (iv) better transition of care; (v) intensive self-care education via an avatar-based 'digital health coach'; and (vi) exercise guidance through the digital coach. Usual care involves standard post-discharge hospital care. The primary outcome is reduced death and/or hospital readmissions at 30 days post-discharge, and secondary outcomes include quality of life, fluid management efficacy, and feasibility and patient engagement. Assuming that our intervention will reduce readmissions and/or deaths by 50%, with a 1:1 ratio of intervention vs. usual care, we plan to randomize 404 patients to show a difference at a statistical power of 80%, using a two-sided alpha of 0.05. We anticipate this recruitment will be achieved by screening 2020 hospitalized HF patients for eligibility. An 8 week pilot programme of our digital health coach in 21 HF patients, age > 75 years, showed overall improvements in quality of life (13 of 21), self-care (12 of 21), and HF knowledge (13 of 21). A pilot of the use of HHU by nurses showed that it was feasible and accurate.\nThe Risk-HF trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a risk-guided intervention to improve HF outcomes and will evaluate the efficacy of trained HF nurses delivering a fluid management protocol that is guided by lung ultrasound with an HHU at point of care.", "With the tremendous development of artificial intelligence, many machine learning algorithms have been applied to the diagnosis of human cancers. Recently, rather than predicting categorical variables (e.g., stages and subtypes) as in cancer diagnosis, several prognosis prediction models basing on patients' survival information have been adopted to estimate the clinical outcome of cancer patients. However, most existing studies treat the diagnosis and prognosis tasks separately. In fact, the diagnosis information (e.g., TNM Stages) indicates the extent of the disease severity that is highly correlated with the patients' survival. While the diagnosis is largely made based on histopathological images, recent studies have also demonstrated that integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data can hold great promise for improving the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers. However, direct combination of these two types of data may bring redundant features that will negatively affect the prediction performance. Therefore, it is necessary to select informative features from the derived multi-modal data. Based on the above considerations, we propose a multi-task multi-modal feature selection method for joint diagnosis and prognosis of cancers. Specifically, we make use of the task relationship learning framework to automatically discover the relationships between the diagnosis and prognosis tasks, through which we can identify important image and genomics features for both tasks. In addition, we add a regularization term to ensure that the correlation within the multi-modal data can be captured. We evaluate our method on three cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project, and the experimental results verify that our method can achieve better performance on both diagnosis and prognosis tasks than the related methods.", "Early-Onset Schizophrenia (EOS) is rare but severe mental health disorder in children and adolescents. Diagnosis of schizophrenia before the age of 18 years remains complex and challenging, especially in young children. In France, there are no recent reliable epidemiological data about the prevalence of EOS. The present study evaluates the EOS rate in a target clinical population of children and adolescents in psychiatric and medico-social care centres in the South-East of France.\nPsychiatric and medico-social centres for children and adolescent in the geographical area have been contacted, and after receiving their agreement to participate in the study, eligible patients corresponding to inclusion criteria were selected based on patients' medical records. Main inclusion criteria were age 7 to 17 years and intelligence quotient > 35. EOS categorical diagnosis was assessed by Kiddie-SADS Present and Lifetime psychosis section.\n37 centres participated and 302 subjects have been included in the study. The main result was the categorical diagnosis of EOS in 27 subjects, corresponding to a rate of 8.9% in the study population. Half of the patients presented mild to moderate intellectual deficiency. Interestingly, only 2.3% had a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder noted in their medical records before standardized assessment.\nThe results of the study highlight the importance of using a standardized diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the paediatric population. In fact, EOS might be underdiagnosed in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders and subnormal cognitive functioning.\nNCT01512641. Registered 19 January 2012; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01512641.", "Increasing automation calls for evaluating the effectiveness and intelligence of automated vehicles. This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating the intelligence of automated vehicles. Firstly, we establish the evaluation environment for automated vehicles including test field, test task, and evaluation index. The test tasks include the single vehicle decision-making (turning, lane-changing, overtaking, etc.) and the maneuver execution of multi-vehicle interaction (obstacle avoidance, trajectory optimization, etc.). The intelligence evaluation index is the action amount of driving process considering the safety, efficiency, rationality and comfort. Then, we calculate the actual action amount of the automated vehicle in different scenarios in the test field. Finally, the least action calculated theoretically corresponds to the highest intelligence degree of the automated vehicle, and is employed as a standard to quantify the performance of other tested automated vehicles. The effectiveness of this framework is verified with two naturalistic driving datasets that contain the normal driving scenarios and high-risk scenarios. Specifically, the naturalistic lane-changing data filters 40,416 frames and 179 similar lane-changing trajectories. Compared with the lane-changing behavior of a large number of drivers, experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve the intelligence degree of drivers in the lane change scenario. Meanwhile, in 253 reconstructed high-risk scenarios, the intelligent risk avoidance ability of the proposed intelligence degree evaluation algorithm can be verified by comparing with the driver behavior and TTC algorithm. These experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively quantify intelligence and evaluate the performance of automated vehicles under various scenarios.", "We hypothesized that published performances of algorithms for artificial intelligence (AI) pneumothorax (PTX) detection in chest radiographs (CXRs) do not sufficiently consider the influence of PTX size and confounding effects caused by thoracic tubes (TTs). Therefore, we established a radiologically annotated benchmarking cohort (n = 6446) allowing for a detailed subgroup analysis.\nWe retrospectively identified 6434 supine CXRs, among them 1652 PTX-positive cases and 4782 PTX-negative cases. Supine CXRs were radiologically annotated for PTX size, PTX location, and inserted TTs. The diagnostic performances of 2 AI algorithms (\"AI_CheXNet\" [Rajpurkar et al], \"AI_1.5\" [Guendel et al]), both trained on publicly available datasets with labels obtained from automatic report interpretation, were quantified. The algorithms' discriminative power for PTX detection was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC), and significance analysis was based on the corresponding 95% confidence interval. A detailed subgroup analysis was performed to quantify the influence of PTX size and the confounding effects caused by inserted TTs.\nAlgorithm performance was quantified as follows: overall performance with AUROCs of 0.704 (AI_1.5) / 0.765 (AI_CheXNet) for unilateral PTXs, AUROCs of 0.666 (AI_1.5) / 0.722 (AI_CheXNet) for unilateral PTXs smaller than 1 cm, and AUROCs of 0.735 (AI_1.5) / 0.818 (AI_CheXNet) for unilateral PTXs larger than 2 cm. Subgroup analysis identified TTs to be strong confounders that significantly influence algorithm performance: Discriminative power is completely eliminated by analyzing PTX-positive cases without TTs referenced to control PTX-negative cases with inserted TTs. Contrarily, AUROCs increased up to 0.875 (AI_CheXNet) for large PTX-positive cases with inserted TTs referenced to control cases without TTs.\nOur detailed subgroup analysis demonstrated that the performance of established AI algorithms for PTX detection trained on public datasets strongly depends on PTX size and is significantly biased by confounding image features, such as inserted TTS. Our established, clinically relevant and radiologically annotated benchmarking cohort might be of great benefit for ongoing algorithm development.", "Leonard Bickman's article on the future of artificial intelligence (AI) in psychotherapy research paints an encouraging picture of the progress to be made in this field. We support his perspective, but we also offer some cautionary notes about the boost AI can provide. We suggest that AI is not likely to transform psychotherapy research or practice to the degree seen in pharmacology and medicine because the factors that contribute to treatment response in these realms differ so markedly from one another, and in ways that do not favor advances in psychotherapy. Despite this limitation, it seems likely that AI will have a beneficial impact, improving empirical analysis through data-driven model development, tools for addressing the limitations of traditional regression methods, and novel means of personalizing treatment. In addition, AI has the potential to augment the reach of the researcher and therapist by expanding our ability to gather data and deliver interventions beyond the confines of the lab or clinical office.", "We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system for the real-time diagnosis of pharyngeal cancers.\nEndoscopic video images and still images of pharyngeal cancer treated in our facility were collected. A total of 4559 images of pathologically proven pharyngeal cancer (1243 using white light imaging and 3316 using narrow-band imaging/blue laser imaging) from 276 patients were used as a training dataset. The AI system used a convolutional neural network (CNN) model typical of the type used to analyze visual imagery. Supervised learning was used to train the CNN. The AI system was evaluated using an independent validation dataset of 25 video images of pharyngeal cancer and 36 video images of normal pharynx taken at our hospital.\nThe AI system diagnosed 23/25 (92%) pharyngeal cancers as cancers and 17/36 (47%) non-cancers as non-cancers. The transaction speed of the AI system was 0.03\u00a0s per image, which meets the required speed for real-time diagnosis. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the detection of cancer were 92%, 47%, and 66% respectively.\nOur single-institution study showed that our AI system for diagnosing cancers of the pharyngeal region had promising performance with high sensitivity and acceptable specificity. Further training and improvement of the system are required with a larger dataset including multiple centers.", "The rheology of the oil well cement plays a pivotal role in the cement placement. Accurate prediction of cement rheological parameters helps to monitor the durability and pumpability of the cement slurry. In this study, an artificial neural network is used to develop different models for the prediction of various rheological parameters such as shear stress, apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity, and yield point of a class G cement slurry with nanoclay as an additive. An extensive experimental study was conducted to generate enough data set for the training of artificial intelligence models. The class G oil well cement slurries were prepared by fixing the water-cement ratio to 0.44 and adding organically modified nanoclays as a strength enhancer. The rheological properties of the oil well cement slurries were investigated at a wide range of temperatures (37 \u2264 T \u2264 90 \u00b0C) and shear rates (5 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 500 s-1). Experimental data generated were used for the training of feed-forward neural networks. The predicted values of the rheological properties from the trained model showed a good agreement when compared with the experimental values. The average absolute percentage error was less than 5% in both training and validation phases of modeling. A trend analysis was carried out to ensure that the proposed models can define the underlying physics. From the validation and the trend analysis, it was found that the new models can be used to predict cement rheological properties within the range of data set on which the models were trained. The proposed models are independent of laboratory-dependent variables and can give quick and real-time values of the rheological parameters.", "Many studies results suggest how can we improve the academic performance for our kids. The purposes of this study were to examine how physical activity could affect both academic achievement and fluid intelligence in adolescence.\nWe measured the three variables (physical, cognitive, academic) and try to find the correlations between them.\nA total of 167 adolescents (mean age = 16.34 years SD = 1.2) from Morocco are participating in this study. The cardiorespiratory fitness was measured with the20 m endurance shuttle-run test. We also assessed the Resistance capacity with 500m sprint test. The academic achievement was assessed by school grades. The fluid intelligence was assessed by using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. We examined the correlation between all variables.\nThis study indicates that the academic achievement was positively associated with the Fluid Intelligence and also with the Resistance Capacity and not with Cardiorespiratory Fitness (VO2peak).\nWe can conclude that the professionals and researchers in sports and education have to promote physical activity at the school age for a public health purpose.", "Refractive surgery refers to any procedure that corrects or minimizes refractive errors. Today, refractive surgery has evolved beyond the traditional laser refractive surgery, embodied by the popular laser in situ keratomileusis or 'LASIK'. New keratorefractive techniques such as small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) avoids corneal flap creation and uses a single laser device, while advances in surface ablation techniques have seen a resurgence in its popularity. Presbyopic treatment options have also expanded to include new ablation profiles, intracorneal implants, and phakic intraocular implants. With the improved safety and efficacy of refractive lens exchange, a wider variety of intraocular lens implants with advanced optics provide more options for refractive correction in carefully selected patients. In this review, we also discuss possible developments in refractive surgery beyond 2020, such as preoperative evaluation of refractive patients using machine learning and artificial intelligence, potential use of stromal lenticules harvested from SMILE for presbyopic treatments, and various advances in intraocular lens implants that may provide a closer to 'physiological correction' of refractive errors.\n\u6458\u8981: \u5c48\u5149\u624b\u672f\u662f\u6307\u77eb\u6b63\u6216\u51cf\u5c11\u5c48\u5149\u4e0d\u6b63\u5ea6\u6570\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u624b\u672f\u3002\u5982\u4eca, \u5c48\u5149\u624b\u672f\u5df2\u7ecf\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u624b\u672f\u65b9\u5f0f, \u4ee5\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u539f\u4f4d\u89d2\u819c\u78e8\u9576\u672f\u6216\u201dLASIK\u201d\u4e3a\u4ee3\u8868(laser in-situ keratomileusis, LASIK)\u3002\u65b0\u7684\u89d2\u819c\u5c48\u5149\u6280\u672f\u5982\u5c0f\u5207\u53e3\u89d2\u819c\u57fa\u8d28\u900f\u955c\u53d6\u51fa\u672f (small incision lenticule extraction, SMILE) \u907f\u514d\u4e86\u89d2\u819c\u74e3\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u6fc0\u5149\u8bbe\u5907, \u53e6\u5916, \u8868\u9762\u6d88\u878d\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u4f7f\u5176\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u56de\u5347\u3002\u8001\u82b1\u773c\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u4e5f\u5df2\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6d89\u53ca\u65b0\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u65b9\u5f0f, \u89d2\u819c\u5185\u690d\u5165\u7269\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6676\u72b6\u4f53\u690d\u5165\u7269\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5c48\u5149\u955c\u7247\u66f4\u6362\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u529f\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8, \u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u5149\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6676\u72b6\u4f53\u690d\u5165\u7269\u4e3a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6311\u9009\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u5c48\u5149\u77eb\u6b63\u624b\u672f\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e2d, \u8ba8\u8bba\u4e862020\u5e74\u4ee5\u540e\u5c48\u5149\u624b\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55, \u4f8b\u5982\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u5c48\u5149\u624b\u672f\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u672f\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30, \u4eceSMILE\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u89d2\u819c\u57fa\u8d28\u900f\u955c\u5728\u8001\u89c6\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528, \u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u6676\u72b6\u4f53\u690d\u5165\u7269\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u8fdb\u6b65\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5c48\u5149\u4e0d\u6b63\u7684\u201c\u751f\u7406\u6027\u7684\u77eb\u6b63\u201d\u3002.", "Irrespective of how plastics litter the coastline or enter the sea, they pose a major threat to birds and marine life alike. In this study, an artificial intelligence tool was used to create an image classifier based on a convolutional neural network architecture that utilises the bottleneck method. The trained bottleneck method classifier was able to categorise plastics encountered either at the shoreline or floating at the sea surface into eight distinct classes, namely, plastic bags, bottles, buckets, food wrappings, straws, derelict nets, fish, and other objects. Discerning objects with a success rate of 90%, the proposed deep learning approach constitutes a leap towards the smart identification of plastics at the coastline and the sea. Training and testing loss and accuracy results for a range of epochs and batch sizes have lent credibility to the proposed method. Results originating from a resolution sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the prediction technique retains its ability to correctly identify plastics even when image resolution was downsized by 75%. Intelligent tools, such as the one suggested here, can replace manual sorting of macroplastics from human operators revealing, for the first time, the true scale of the amount of plastic polluting our beaches and the seas.", "Hundreds of thousands of students drop out of school each year in the United States, despite billions of dollars of funding and myriad educational reforms. Existing research tends to look at the effect of easily measurable student characteristics. However, a vast number of harder-to-measure student traits, skills, and resources affect educational success. We present a conceptual framework for the cumulative effect of all factors, which we call student capital. We develop a method for estimating student capital in groups of students and find that student capital is distributed exponentially in each of 140 cohorts of community college students. Students' ability to be successful does not behave like standard tests of intelligence. Instead, it acts like a limited resource, distributed unequally. The results suggest that rather than removing barriers related to easily measured characteristics, interventions should be focused on building up the skills and resources needed to be successful in school.", "Extensive empirical evidence suggests that there is a maximal number of people with whom an individual can maintain stable social relationships (the Dunbar number). We argue that this arises as a consequence of a natural phase transition in the dynamic self-organization among N individuals within a social system. We present the calculated size dependence of the scaling properties of complex social network models to argue that this collective behavior is an enhanced form of collective intelligence. Direct calculation establishes that the complexity of social networks as measured by their scaling behavior is nonmonotonic, peaking around 150, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the value of the Dunbar number. Thus, we establish a theory-based bridge spanning the gap between sociology and psychology.", "Epidemiological studies have shown inverse association between intelligence and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.\nBased on 242 SNPs independently associated with intelligence, we calculated the genetic intelligence score (gIQ) for participants from 10 CAD case-control studies (n\u2009=\u200934,083) and UK Biobank (n\u2009=\u2009427,306). From UK Biobank, we extracted phenotypes including body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), smoking, hypertension, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, measured intelligence score, and education attainment. To estimate the effects of gIQ on CAD and its related risk factors, regression analyses was applied. Next, we studied the mediatory roles of measured intelligence and educational attainment. Lastly, Mendelian randomization was performed to validate the findings.\nIn CAD case-control studies, one standard deviation (SD) increase of gIQ was related to a 5% decrease of CAD risk (odds ratio [OR] of 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93 to 0.98; P\u2009=\u20094.93e-5), which was validated in UK Biobank (OR\u2009=\u20090.97; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99; P\u2009=\u20096.4e-4). In UK Biobank, we also found significant inverse correlations between gIQ and risk factors of CAD including smoking, BMI, T2D, hypertension, and a positive correlation with HDL cholesterol. The association signals between gIQ and CAD as well as its risk factors got largely attenuated after the adjustment of measured intelligence and educational attainment. The causal role of intelligence in mediating CAD risk was confirmed by Mendelian randomization analyses.\nGenetic components of intelligence affect measured intelligence and educational attainment, which subsequently affect the prevalence of CAD via a series of unfavorable risk factor profiles.", "The correct \"dosing\" of neuropsychological assessment is of interest for the purposes of cost management and the personalization of medicine/assessment. In this context, embedded IQ screening, rather than routine comprehensive IQ testing, may be useful in identifying youth at risk for Intellectual Disability (ID) for whom further assessment is needed. This retrospective, cross-sectional study examined subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-5) needed to identify youth with Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) \u226475.\nData were obtained from a large pediatric clinically referred sample (N\u2009=\u20094,299; Mean Age = 10.7\u2009years; Range = 6-16y; 66% male; 54% White; 29% receiving Public Insurance), divided into training (n\u2009=\u20092149) and test (n\u2009=\u20092150) samples.\nIn the training sample, sequential and additive regression-based models for predicting FSIQ comprised of one (Block Design [BD]), two (BD\u2009+\u2009Similarities [SI]), three (BD\u2009+\u2009SI\u2009+\u2009Matrix Reasoning [MR]), and four (BD\u2009+\u2009SI\u2009+\u2009MR\u2009+\u2009Digit Span [DS]) subtests of the WISC-5 explained 61.3%, 82.7%, 88.5%, and 93.0% of FSIQ variance, respectively. Using a predicted FSIQ \u2264 80 as a cut score to identify persons with observed FSIQ \u226475, the two subtest (BD\u2009+\u2009SI) model showed strong sensitivity (83.4), specificity (90.5), and negative predictive value (96.2) in the test sample; however, positive predictive value was low (65.3%). Three and four subtest models provided incremental, but modest gains in classification metrics.\nFindings suggest the first several subtests of the WISC-5 can be used to identify clinically referred youth at risk for ID who subsequently require full administration of the WISC-5 for consideration of an ID diagnosis.", "Background and Objectives: This study aimed to group diseases classified by the International Classification of Diseases using principal component analysis, and discuss a systematic approach to reducing the preventable death rate from a perspective of public health. Materials and Methods: Using a 10-year follow-up analysis of the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) data, this study obtained de-identified data including participants' data of community-dwelling individuals aged \u226545 years from 2006 to 2016. Participants were randomly selected using a multistage, stratified probability sampling based on geographical area and housing type. We excluded 37 participants with missing information at baseline and included 10,217 study participants. This study used the principal component analysis to extract comorbidity patterns, and chi-square test and Cox proportional hazards models for analyzing the association between the factors of interest. Results: Principal component 1 (diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension) was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of 1.079 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.031-1.129, p = 0.001). Principal component 3 (psychiatric and cerebrovascular diseases) was related to an increased HR of 1.134 (95% CI 1.094-1.175, p < 0.0001). Moreover, principal component 4 was associated with a high HR of 1.172 (95% CI 1.130-1.215, p < 0.0001). However, among participants aged between 45 and 64 years, principal component 4 showed a meaningfully increased HR of 1.262 (95% CI 1.184-1.346, p < 0.001). In this study, among the four principal components, three were statistically associated with increased mortality. Conclusions: The principal component analysis for predicting mortality may become a useful tool, and artificial intelligence (AI) will improve a value-based healthcare strategy, along with developing a clinical decision support model.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually changing the practice of surgery with technological advancements in imaging, navigation, and robotic intervention. In this article, we review the recent successful and influential applications of AI in surgery from preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance to its integration into surgical robots. We conclude this review by summarizing the current state, emerging trends, and major challenges in the future development of AI in surgery.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) have revolutionized image analysis. In surgery, CV applications have focused on surgical phase identification in laparoscopic videos. We proposed to apply CV techniques to identify phases in an endoscopic procedure, peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM).\nPOEM videos were collected from Massachusetts General and Showa University Koto Toyosu Hospitals. Videos were labeled by surgeons with the following ground truth phases: (1) Submucosal injection, (2) Mucosotomy, (3) Submucosal tunnel, (4) Myotomy, and (5) Mucosotomy closure. The deep-learning CV model-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) plus Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-was trained on 30 videos to create POEMNet. We then used POEMNet to identify operative phases in the remaining 20 videos. The model's performance was compared to surgeon annotated ground truth.\nPOEMNet's overall phase identification accuracy was 87.6% (95% CI 87.4-87.9%). When evaluated on a per-phase basis, the model performed well, with mean unweighted and prevalence-weighted F1 scores of 0.766 and 0.875, respectively. The model performed best with longer phases, with 70.6% accuracy for phases that had a duration under 5 min and 88.3% accuracy for longer phases.\nA deep-learning-based approach to CV, previously successful in laparoscopic video phase identification, translates well to endoscopic procedures. With continued refinements, AI could contribute to intra-operative decision-support systems and post-operative risk prediction.", "The present review discusses recent progress in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which can describe cellular heterogeneity in various organs, bodily fluids, and pathologies (e.g., cancer and Alzheimer's disease). We outline scRNA-seq techniques that are suitable for investigating cellular heterogeneity that is present in cell populations with very high resolution of the transcriptomic landscape. We summarize scRNA-seq findings and applications of this technology to identify cell types, activity, and other features that are important for the function of different bodily organs. We discuss future directions for scRNA-seq techniques that can link gene expression, protein expression, cellular function, and their roles in pathology. We speculate on how the field could develop beyond its present limitations (e.g., performing scRNA-seq in situ and in vivo). Finally, we discuss the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence with cutting-edge scRNA-seq technology, which could provide a strong basis for designing precision medicine and targeted therapy in the future.", "In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the prospect of machine learning models demonstrating expert-level diagnosis in multiple disease contexts. However, there is concern that the excitement around this field may be associated with inadequate scrutiny of methodology and insufficient adoption of scientific good practice in the studies involving artificial intelligence in health care. This article aims to empower clinicians and researchers to critically appraise studies of clinical applications of machine learning, through: (1) introducing basic machine learning concepts and nomenclature; (2) outlining key applicable principles of evidence-based medicine; and (3) highlighting some of the potential pitfalls in the design and reporting of these studies.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities to identify the health risks of patients and thus influence patient safety outcomes.\nThe purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyze quantitative studies utilizing or integrating AI to address and report clinical-level patient safety outcomes.\nWe restricted our search to the PubMed, PubMed Central, and Web of Science databases to retrieve research articles published in English between January 2009 and August 2019. We focused on quantitative studies that reported positive, negative, or intermediate changes in patient safety outcomes using AI apps, specifically those based on machine-learning algorithms and natural language processing. Quantitative studies reporting only AI performance but not its influence on patient safety outcomes were excluded from further review.\nWe identified 53 eligible studies, which were summarized concerning their patient safety subcategories, the most frequently used AI, and reported performance metrics. Recognized safety subcategories were clinical alarms (n=9; mainly based on decision tree models), clinical reports (n=21; based on support vector machine models), and drug safety (n=23; mainly based on decision tree models). Analysis of these 53 studies also identified two essential findings: (1) the lack of a standardized benchmark and (2) heterogeneity in AI reporting.\nThis systematic review indicates that AI-enabled decision support systems, when implemented correctly, can aid in enhancing patient safety by improving error detection, patient stratification, and drug management. Future work is still needed for robust validation of these systems in prospective and real-world clinical environments to understand how well AI can predict safety outcomes in health care settings.", "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are creating new opportunities for personalizing technology-based health interventions to adolescents. This article provides a computer science perspective on how emerging AI technologies-intelligent learning environments, interactive narrative generation, user modeling, and adaptive coaching-can be utilized to model adolescent learning and engagement and deliver personalized support in adaptive health technologies. Many of these technologies have emerged from human-centered applications of AI in education, training, and entertainment. However, their application to improving healthcare, to date, has been comparatively limited. We illustrate the opportunities provided by AI-driven adaptive technologies for adolescent preventive healthcare by describing a vision of how future adolescent preventive health interventions might be delivered both inside and outside of the clinic. Key challenges posed by AI-driven health technologies are also presented, including issues of privacy, ethics, encoded bias, and integration into clinical workflows and adolescent lives. Examples of empirical findings about the effectiveness of AI technologies for user modeling and adaptive coaching are presented, which underscore their promise for application toward adolescent health. The article concludes with a brief discussion of future research directions for the field, which is well positioned to leverage AI to improve adolescent health and well-being.", "Background: Elderly residents in nursing homes have multiple comorbidities (including cognitive and psycho-behavioral pathologies, malnutrition, heart failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure) and use multiple medications. Methods: The GER-e-TEC project aims to provide these fragile and complex patients with telemedicine tools, more specifically telemonitoring, backed by a well-defined and personalized protocol. Results: Medically, this implies the need for regular monitoring and a high level of medical and multidisciplinary expertise for the healthcare team. The tools use non-invasive communicating sensors and artificial intelligence techniques, allowing daily monitoring with the ability to detect any abnormal changes in the patient's condition early. Conclusions: The GER-e-TEC project specifically considers the challenges of aging residents and significant challenges in nursing homes, with the main geriatric syndromes (falls, malnutrition, cognitive-behavioral disorders, and iatrogenic conditions).", "In the gastroenterology field, the impact of artificial intelligence was investigated for the purposes of diagnostics, risk stratification of patients, improvement in quality of endoscopic procedures and early detection of neoplastic diseases, implementation of the best treatment strategy, and optimization of patient prognosis. Computer-assisted diagnostic systems to evaluate upper endoscopy images have recently emerged as a supporting tool in endoscopy due to the risks of misdiagnosis related to standard endoscopy and different expertise levels of endoscopists, time-consuming procedures, lack of availability of advanced procedures, increasing workloads, and development of endoscopic mass screening programs. Recent research has tended toward computerized, automatic, and real-time detection of lesions, which are approaches that offer utility in daily practice. Despite promising results, certain studies might overexaggerate the diagnostic accuracy of artificial systems, and several limitations remain to be overcome in the future. Therefore, additional multicenter randomized trials and the development of existent database platforms are needed to certify clinical implementation. This paper presents an overview of the literature and the current knowledge of the usefulness of different types of machine learning systems in the assessment of premalignant and malignant esophageal lesions via conventional and advanced endoscopic procedures. This study makes a presentation of the artificial intelligence terminology and refers also to the most prominent recent research on computer-assisted diagnosis of neoplasia on Barrett's esophagus and early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and prediction of invasion depth in esophageal neoplasms. Furthermore, this review highlights the main directions of future doctor-computer collaborations in which machines are expected to improve the quality of medical action and routine clinical workflow, thus reducing the burden on physicians.", "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated classification and segmentation of optical coherence tomography (OCT) features have become increasingly popular. However, its 3-dimensional volumetric nature has made developing an algorithm that generalizes across all patient populations and OCT devices challenging. Several recent studies have reported high diagnostic performances of AI models; however, significant methodological challenges still exist in applying these models in real-world clinical practice. Lack of large-image datasets from multiple OCT devices, nonstandardized imaging or post-processing protocols between devices, limited graphics processing unit capabilities for exploiting 3-dimensional features, and inconsistency in the reporting metrics are major hurdles in enabling AI for OCT analyses. We discuss these issues and present possible solutions.", "Mastitis is an inflammation in the breast, which may involve a bacterial infection. Breast infection during breastfeeding is a common phenomenon that requires immediate and appropriate treatment. Without proper treatment, inflammation may lead to the cessation of breastfeeding. Another potential complication is the development of an abscess. Based on the nutritional and immunological value of breast milk, the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) is exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months of age, followed by continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are introduced, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infanRecent meta-analyses indicate breastfeeding protects against childhood infections, allows for a possible increase in intelligence, and for a reduction in overweight and diabetes. Breastfeeding is beneficial for nursing women as well. It is therefore important to help the mother overcome difficulties such as mastitis and to continue breastfeeding. The choice of a proper treatment and the provision of therapeutic instructions to the patient are crucial for a cure, for a successful duration of breastfeeding, and for preventing complications for mother and baby. In this article, we provide the latest clinical guidelines regarding drug treatment and supportive therapy in mastitis. We also discuss the latest guidelines of candida treatment, as candida infection may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Overall, improperly treated mastitis may cause the premature cessation of breastfeeding, and will cause suffering to both mother and baby; giving proper treatment and instructions to the mother are hence of the utmost importance.", "In this study, copper (Cu), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) analyses were performed, and the results were modelled by artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Samples were taken from 3 stations selected on the Bartin River for 1 year between December 2012 and December 2013. Radial basis neural network (RBANN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks models, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were applied to the data in order to predict the heavy metal concentrations. As a result of the study, the RMSE and MAE values of all the heavy metal models were found to have very low error values during the test phase, and it was found that the models created using MLP had R2 values higher than 0.77 during the test phase; the test phase R2 values of the models using RBN method were found to be ranging between 0.773 and 0.989, and the test phase R2 value of the ANFIS model was higher than 0.80. If sorted from the best model to the worst by taking the MAE and RMSE values into consideration based on the test evaluation results, according to the heavy metal types, where all of the MLP, RBN, and ANFIS models were generally approximate to each other, RBN was successful for Cu, Zn, and Mn, while MLP model was successful for Ni and ANFIS model for Fe and Pb. According to the results, it can be inferred that the heavy metal contents can be estimated approximately with artificial intelligence models and relatively easy-to-measure parameters; it will be possible to detect heavy metals which are harmful to the viability of the rivers, both quickly and economically.", "With new tools from artificial intelligence and new perspectives on personalizing interventions, we could revolutionize the way mental health services are delivered and achieve major gains in improving the public's mental health. We examine Dr. Bickman's vision around these technological and paradigm changes that would usher in major scientific, workforce training, and societal cultural changes. We argue that additional efforts in research evaluations in implementation have the potential to scale up and adapt existing interventions and scale them out to diverse populations and service systems. The next stage of this work involves testing the effectiveness of personalized interventions that are preferred by the public and integrating these choices into sustainable service systems. We note cautions on the delivery of these programs as automated algorithmic recommendations are heretofore foreign to humans.", "Endoscopy is in a period of continuous innovations in terms of image quality, endoscopes, post-processing software and lastly, application of Artificial Intelligence. Therapeutic boundaries have expanded, widening the grey zone between endoscopy and surgery, and increasing endoscopic approaches in clinical scenarios where, until a few years ago, surgery was the only option. New scopes and accessories have made it easier to access critical areas such as the biliary tree and the small bowel intestine. In the field of hepato-pancreato-biliary endoscopy (HPB), it is now possible to directly access the biliary ducts or cystic lesions though dedicated stents and scopes, rather than having to rely only on fluoroscopy and ultrasound, increasing the diagnostic and therapeutic options by applying a three-dimensional approach. This narrative review will give an overview of some of the most relevant emerging fields in luminal and HPB endoscopy, highlighting advantages and main limitations of the techniques, and providing considerations for future development.", "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is yielding a global outbreak with severe threats to public health. In this paper, we aimed at reviewing the current knowledge about COVID-19 infectious risk status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients requiring immunosuppressive medication. We also focused on several molecular insights that could explain why IBD patients appear not to have higher risks of infection and worse outcomes in COVID-19 than the general population in an attempt to provide scientific support for safer decisions in IBD patient care.\nPubMed electronic database was interrogated for relevant articles involving data about common molecular pathways and shared treatment strategies between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Besides, Neural Covidex, an artificial intelligence tool, was used to answer queries about pathogenic coronaviruses and possible IBD interactions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Discussions. Few molecular and therapeutic interactions between IBD and pathogenic coronaviruses were explored. First, we showed how the activity of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, CD209L other receptors, and phosphorylated \u03b1 subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 might exert protective impact in IBD in case of coronavirus infection. Second, IBD medication was discussed in the context of possible beneficial effects on COVID-19 pathogeny, including \"cytokine storm\" prevention and treatment, immunomodulation, interferon signaling blocking, and viral endocytosis inhibition.\nUsing the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other pathogenic coronaviruses immunopathology, we showed why IBD patients should not be considered at an increased risk of infection or more severe outcomes. Whether our findings are entirely applicable to the pathogenesis, disease susceptibility, and treatment management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD must be further explored.", "Allosteric regulation is a common mechanism employed by complex biomolecular systems for regulation of activity and adaptability in the cellular environment, serving as an effective molecular tool for cellular communication. As an intrinsic but elusive property, allostery is a ubiquitous phenomenon where binding or disturbing of a distal site in a protein can functionally control its activity and is considered as the \"second secret of life.\" The fundamental biological importance and complexity of these processes require a multi-faceted platform of synergistically integrated approaches for prediction and characterization of allosteric functional states, atomistic reconstruction of allosteric regulatory mechanisms and discovery of allosteric modulators. The unifying theme and overarching goal of allosteric regulation studies in recent years have been integration between emerging experiment and computational approaches and technologies to advance quantitative characterization of allosteric mechanisms in proteins. Despite significant advances, the quantitative characterization and reliable prediction of functional allosteric states, interactions, and mechanisms continue to present highly challenging problems in the field. In this review, we discuss simulation-based multiscale approaches, experiment-informed Markovian models, and network modeling of allostery and information-theoretical approaches that can describe the thermodynamics and hierarchy allosteric states and the molecular basis of allosteric mechanisms. The wealth of structural and functional information along with diversity and complexity of allosteric mechanisms in therapeutically important protein families have provided a well-suited platform for development of data-driven research strategies. Data-centric integration of chemistry, biology and computer science using artificial intelligence technologies has gained a significant momentum and at the forefront of many cross-disciplinary efforts. We discuss new developments in the machine learning field and the emergence of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning applications in modeling of molecular mechanisms and allosteric proteins. The experiment-guided integrated approaches empowered by recent advances in multiscale modeling, network science, and machine learning can lead to more reliable prediction of allosteric regulatory mechanisms and discovery of allosteric modulators for therapeutically important protein targets.", "Background: Knowledge is increasing about TSC-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (TAND), but little is known about the potentially confounding effects of intellectual ability (IA) on the rates of TAND across age, sex, and genotype. We evaluated TAND in (a) children vs. adults, (b) males vs. females, and (c) TSC1 vs. TSC2 mutations, after stratification for levels of IA, in a large, international cohort. Methods: Individuals of any age with a documented visit for TSC in the 12 months prior to enrolment were included. Frequency and percentages of baseline TAND manifestations were presented by categories of IA (no intellectual disability [ID, intelligence quotient (IQ)>70]; mild ID [IQ 50-70]; moderate-to-profound ID [IQ<50]). Chi-square tests were used to test associations between ID and TAND manifestations. The association between TAND and age (children vs. adults), sex (male vs. female), and genotype (TSC1 vs. TSC2) stratified by IA levels were examined using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests. Results: Eight hundred and ninety four of the 2,211 participants had formal IQ assessments. There was a significant association (P < 0.05) between levels of IA and the majority of TAND manifestations, except impulsivity (P = 0.12), overactivity (P = 0.26), mood swings (P = 0.08), hallucinations (P = 0.20), psychosis (P = 0.06), depressive disorder (P = 0.23), and anxiety disorder (P = 0.65). Once controlled for IA, children had higher rates of overactivity, but most behavioral difficulties were higher in adults. At the psychiatric level, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was seen at higher rates in children while anxiety and depressive disorders were observed at higher rates in adults. Compared to females, males showed significantly higher rates of impulsivity and overactivity, as well as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD. No significant age or sex differences were observed for academic difficulties or neuropsychological deficits. After controlling for IA no genotype-TAND associations were observed, except for higher rates of self-injury in individuals with TSC2 mutations. Conclusions: Findings suggest IA as risk marker for most TAND manifestations. We provide the first evidence of male preponderance of ASD and ADHD in individuals with TSC. The study also confirms the association between TSC2 and IA but, once controlling for IA, disproves the previously reported TSC2 association with ASD and with most other TAND manifestations.", "Questions regarding the role of the corpus callosum in attention are raised by the reports of attention problems in some persons with agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC), as well as by abnormalities in callosal size in persons with attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder. The current study assessed inattention, impulsivity, and vigilance in individuals with AgCC.\nThese domains of attention were assessed using the Conners' Continuous Performance Test II in 18 older adolescents and adults (ages 16-52) with complete AgCC and normal intelligence (full scale intelligence quotient > 80). Scores were converted to T scores using age-specific norms and assessed for departure from the normative sample.\nScores were significantly elevated in older adolescents with AgCC for errors of commission (p = .050, d = 0.55) and detectability (p = .03, d = 0.58). Older adolescents were worse than adults for commissions (p = .06, \u03b7p\u00b2 = .201) and detectability (p = .03, \u03b7p\u00b2 = .273). Also, male individuals had significantly higher (worse) scores than did female in vigilance (p = .01, \u03b7p\u00b2 = .337).\nThese results suggest moderate levels of difficulties in sustained attention in AgCC, particularly in maintaining response inhibition and in vigilance, that are modulated by age and sex.

We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted cytology system in cervical cancer screening program.\nWe conducted a perspective cohort study within a population-based cervical cancer screening program for 0.7\u00a0million women, using a validated AI-assisted cytology system. For comparison, cytologists examined all slides classified by AI as abnormal and a randomly selected 10% of normal slides. Each woman with slides classified as abnormal by either AI-assisted or manual reading was diagnosed by colposcopy and biopsy. The outcomes were histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+).\nFinally, we recruited 703\u00a0103 women, of whom 98\u00a0549 were independently screened by AI and manual reading. The overall agreement rate between AI and manual reading was 94.7% (95% confidential interval [CI], 94.5%-94.8%), and kappa was 0.92 (0.91-0.92). The detection rates of CIN2+ increased with the severity of cytology abnormality performed by both AI and manual reading (Ptrend \u00a0<\u00a00.001). General estimated equations showed that detection of CIN2+ among women with ASC-H or HSIL by AI were significantly higher than corresponding groups classified by cytologists (for ASC-H: odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a01.22, 95%CI 1.11-1.34, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001; for HSIL: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.41, 1.28-1.55, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). AI-assisted cytology was 5.8% (3.0%-8.6%) more sensitive for detection of CIN2+ than manual reading with a slight reduction in specificity.\nAI-assisted cytology system could exclude most of normal cytology, and improve sensitivity with clinically equivalent specificity for detection of CIN2+ compared with manual cytology reading. Overall, the results support AI-based cytology system for the primary cervical cancer screening in large-scale population.", "Although highly successful, the medical R&D model is failing at improving people's health due to a series of flaws and defects inherent to the model itself. A new collective intelligence, incorporating human and artificial intelligence (AI) could overcome these obstacles. Because AI will play a key role in this new collective intelligence, it is necessary that those involved in healthcare have a general knowledge of how these technologies work. With this comprehensive review, we intend to provide it.\nA broad-ranging search has been undertaken on institutional and non-institutional websites in order to identify relevant papers, comments and reports.\nWe firstly describe the flaws and defects of the current R&D biomedical model and how the generation of a new collective intelligence will result in a better and wiser medicine through a truly personalized and holistic approach. We, then, discuss the new forms of data collection and data processing and the different types of artificial learning and their specific algorithms. Finally, we review the current uses and applications of AI in the biomedical field and how these can be expanded, as well as the limitations and challenges of applying these new technologies in the medical field.\nThis colossal common effort based on a new collective intelligence will exponentially improve the quality of medical research, resulting in a radical change for the better in the healthcare model. AI, without replacing us, is here to help us achieve the ambitious goal set by the WHO in the Alma Ata declaration of 1978: \"Health for All\".", "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) have a large impact on patients and their families. Improving intellectual ability outcomes using preventive vigabatrin (VGB) treatment has recently been reported.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the severity of behavioral problems and degree of distress among families of patients with TSC with and without a history of VGB treatment.\nThe study enrolled 21 children and adolescents who were patients with TSC from four hospitals: 14 in the VGB group and 7 in the no-VGB group. To evaluate patients' psychiatric and neurological symptoms, we used the TAND Checklist, Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and Social Responsive Scale-2nd edition (SRS-2).\nAll VGB-group patients were administered VGB after the onset of epileptic seizures. No obvious differences were observed between the VGB and no-VGB groups in behavioral problem scores on the TAND Checklist, or on the ABC, SCQ, and SRS-2 total scores. Behavioral problem scores were lower in patients with normal intelligence than in those with mild intellectual disability (ID; P\u202f=\u202f0.042). Degrees of family distress assessed with the TAND Checklist were not correlated with the intelligence quotient/developmental quotient (IQ/DQ) or seizure frequency but were correlated with the total SRS-2 scores (P\u202f=\u202f0.022). For several patients, there were large discrepancies between familial and physician ratings of the TAND impact score.\nChildren and adolescents with TSC may present with significant behavioral difficulties and family distress, regardless of whether they were treated with VGB or not after the onset of seizures. Difficulties in social communication may have the strongest \"TAND impact\" on families.", "In the face of rapid technological advances in computational cytology including artificial intelligence (AI), optimization of its application to clinical practice would benefit from reflection on the lessons learned from the decades-long journey in the development of computer-assisted Pap test screening.\nThe initial driving force for automated screening in cytology was the overwhelming number of Pap tests requiring manual screening, leading to workflow backlogs and incorrect diagnoses. Several companies invested resources to address these concerns utilizing different specimen processing techniques and imaging systems. However, not all companies were commercially prosperous. Successful implementation of this new technology required viable use cases, improved clinical outcomes, and an acceptable means of integration into the daily workflow of cytopathology laboratories. Several factors including supply and demand, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight, reimbursement, overcoming learning curves and workflow changes associated with the adoption of new technology, and cytologist apprehension, played a significant role in either promoting or preventing the widespread adoption of automated screening technologies. Key Messages: Any change in health care, particularly those involving new technology that impacts clinical workflow, is bound to have its successes and failures. However, perseverance through learning curves, optimizing workflow processes, improvements in diagnostic accuracy, and regulatory and financial approval can facilitate widespread adoption of these technologies. Given their history with successfully implementing automated Pap test screening, cytologists are uniquely positioned to not only help with the development of AI technology for other areas of pathology, but also to guide how they are utilized, regulated, and managed.", "Dermal fillers are increasingly popular for facial rejuvenation and enhancement, including effacement of nasolabial folds (NLFs) and marionette lines and lip augmentation. This study aimed to evaluate casual observer perception of physical and interpersonal traits of subjects who receive filler treatment.\nAn anonymous survey of 8 before/after treatment photographical sets was administered in Likert scale format (1-7) using online crowdsourcing. Three sets of photographs were before/after NLF/ marionette line treatment, three of lip augmentation, and two internal controls. Respondents were surveyed on personal demographics, as well as perceptions of subject photographs across nine domains (facial symmetry, confidence, likeability, youthfulness, trustworthiness, attractiveness, intelligence, approachability, happiness).\nIn total, 260 respondents completed the survey. The majority were male (63.1%), Caucasian (58.1%), 18-34\u00a0years old (58.1%), and college graduates (66.2%). Respondents rated photographs with line filler treatment and lip filler treatment as significantly improved compared to the pre-treatment photographs across all nine trait domains [p\u2009<\u20090.001, for all]. No differences were found between the control photosets [p\u2009>\u20090.05, for all]. Middle-aged respondents (35-55\u00a0years) were more likely to perceive treated filler photographs as more youthful than younger respondents (18-34\u00a0years) [p\u2009<\u20090.006] Additionally, respondents with lower educational attainment (high-school graduate or less) were more likely to perceive treated patients as less intelligent compared to higher-educated respondents (college/postgraduates) [p\u2009<\u20090.05, for both].\nThe use of dermal fillers for treatment of NLF/marionette lines and lip augmentation have significant associations with the perception of improved attractiveness and several personality traits. Additionally, casual observer demographic subgroups may influence perceptions.\nThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

The goal is to provide the reader a better understanding of the potential and challenges of artificial intelligence within the field of medicine.", "Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) and neurotrimin (NTM) are abundant cell-surface proteins found in the brain and form part of the IgLON (Immunoglobulin LSAMP, OBCAM, Neurotrimin) family. In humans, NEGR1 is implicated in obesity and mental disorders, while NTM is linked to intelligence and cognitive function. IgLONs dimerize homophilically and heterophilically, and they are thought to shape synaptic connections and neural circuits by acting in trans (spanning cellular junctions) and/or in cis (at the same side of a junction). Here, we reveal homodimeric structures of NEGR1 and NTM. They assemble into V-shaped complexes via their Ig1 domains, and disruption of the Ig1-Ig1 interface abolishes dimerization in solution. A hydrophobic ridge from one Ig1 domain inserts into a hydrophobic pocket from the opposing Ig1 domain producing an interaction interface that is highly conserved among IgLONs but remarkably plastic structurally. Given the high degree of sequence conservation at the interaction interface, we tested whether different IgLONs could elicit the same biological effect in vivo. In a small-scale study administering different soluble IgLONs directly into the brain and monitoring feeding, only NEGR1 altered food intake significantly. Taking NEGR1 as a prototype, our studies thus indicate that while IgLONs share a conserved mode of interaction and are able to bind each other as homomers and heteromers, they are structurally plastic and can exert unique biological action.", "Sepsis is the primary cause of burn-related mortality and morbidity. Traditional indicators of sepsis exhibit poor performance when used in this unique population due to their underlying hypermetabolic and inflammatory response following burn injury. To address this challenge, we developed the Machine Intelligence Learning Optimizer (MILO), an automated machine learning (ML) platform, to automatically produce ML models for predicting burn sepsis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 211 adult patients (age\u2009\u2265\u200918\u00a0years) with severe burn injury (\u2265\u200920% total body surface area) to generate training and test datasets for ML applications. The MILO approach was compared against an exhaustive \"non-automated\" ML approach as well as standard statistical methods. For this study, traditional multivariate logistic regression (LR) identified seven predictors of burn sepsis when controlled for age and burn size (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.99-4.04, P\u2009=\u20090.032). The area under the ROC (ROC-AUC) when using these seven predictors was 0.88. Next, the non-automated ML approach produced an optimal model based on LR using 16 out of the 23 features from the study dataset. Model accuracy was 86% with ROC-AUC of 0.96. In contrast, MILO identified a k-nearest neighbor-based model using only five features to be the best performer with an accuracy of 90% and a ROC-AUC of 0.96. Machine learning augments burn sepsis prediction. MILO identified models more quickly, with less required features, and found to be analytically superior to traditional ML approaches. Future studies are needed to clinically validate the performance of MILO-derived ML models for sepsis prediction.", "The aim of this study was to examine the role of mobile-based student response systems in teaching to improve university students' academic outcomes. Mobile devices can be useful tools for conveying content to large classes, with a potential impact on academic outcomes. This study involved a total of 294 undergraduates taking a psychology course. The course involved lessons in the classroom, which included answering quizzes (quiz activities) and activities such as preparing reports and laboratory experiences (out-of-class activities). Quizzes were administered using a mobile technology system. Data were collected on the motivational beliefs (theory of intelligence) and self-regulated learning strategies of students who voluntarily completed the online questionnaires. The results of the linear models showed that using the quizzes positively affected the performance in the final exams (involving closed and open questions). The same was true for the out-of-class activities. The motivation and strategy scores correlated moderately with out-of-class activities, but not with quiz activities. These results offer insight on the use of technology during lessons and other course-related activities to promote academic achievement.", "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor. Currently, the suggested line of action is the surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and treatment with the adjuvant temozolomide, a DNA alkylating agent. However, the ability of tumor cells to deeply infiltrate the surrounding tissue makes complete resection quite impossible, and, in consequence, the probability of tumor recurrence is high, and the prognosis is not positive. GBM is highly heterogeneous and adapts to treatment in most individuals. Nevertheless, these mechanisms of adaption are unknown.\nIn this review, we will discuss the recent discoveries in molecular and cellular heterogeneity, mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, and new technological approaches to identify new treatments for GBM. The combination of biology and computer resources allow the use of algorithms to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches to identify potential therapeutic pathways and to identify new drug candidates.\nThese new approaches will generate a better understanding of GBM pathogenesis and will result in novel treatments to reduce or block the devastating consequences of brain cancers.", "To highlight artificial intelligence applications in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic that can be used to: describe ocular findings and changes correlated with COVID-19; extract information from scholarly articles on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 specific to ophthalmology; and implement efficient patient triage and telemedicine care.\nOphthalmology has been leading in artificial intelligence and technology applications. With medical imaging analysis, pixel-annotated distinguishable features on COVID-19 patients may help with noninvasive diagnosis and severity outcome predictions. Using natural language processing (NLP) and data integration methods, topic modeling on more than 200 ophthalmology-related articles on COVID-19 can summarize ocular manifestations, viral transmission, treatment strategies, and patient care and practice management. Artificial intelligence for telemedicine applications can address the high demand, prioritize and triage patients, as well as improve at home-monitoring devices and secure data transfers.\nCOVID-19 is significantly impacting the way we are delivering healthcare. Given the already successful implementation of artificial intelligence applications and telemedicine in ophthalmology, we expect that these systems will be embraced more as tools for research, education, and patient care.", "After participating in this activity, learners should be better able to:\u2022 Assess differences between adult patients with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and healthy control subjects in terms of empathy and related processes\u2022 Evaluate the effects of empathy or related processes as factors contributing to abnormal social functioning in BPD ABSTRACT: We reviewed 45 original research studies, published between 2000 and 2019, to assess differences between adult patients with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and healthy control subjects in terms of empathy and related processes (i.e., theory of mind, mentalizing, social cognition, and emotional intelligence). Thirty-six studies reported deficits of empathy or related processes in patients with BPD. Enhanced emotional empathy in BPD was also reported in eight studies, all of which revealed that patients had increased scores of personal distress on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index self-report questionnaire. Six studies did not find significant differences between patients with BPD and healthy control subjects in terms of empathy or related processes. No study reported enhanced cognitive empathy, social cognition, or emotional intelligence in patients with BPD. We postulate that deficits of empathy or related processes contribute to preempting the formation of stable interpersonal relationships, whereas enhanced emotional empathy might lead to personal (and interpersonal) distress, further contributing to abnormal social functioning in BPD.", "The contribution of sleep disturbance to persistent cognitive symptoms following a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) remains unclear. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is very common, yet its relationship between risk factors for developing OSA and cognitive performance in those with history of mTBI has not been investigated. The current study examined OSA risk levels and its association with cognitive performance in 391 combat-exposed, post-911 veterans and service members (median age\u2009=\u200937 years) enrolled in the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) prospective multi-center study. Participants included those with and without mTBI (n\u2009=\u2009326 and 65, respectively). When using clinical cut-offs, those with history of mTBI were more likely to be categorized as high risk for OSA (mTBI positive\u2009=\u200965% vs. mTBI negative\u2009=\u200951%). After adjustment for TBI status and demographic variables, increased OSA risk was significantly associated with worse performance on measures of complex processing speed and executive functioning (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Fourth Edition Coding, Trail Making Test, part B) and greater symptom burden (Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory). Thus, OSA, a modifiable behavioral health factor, likely contributes to cognitive performance following mTBI. Accordingly, OSA serves as a potential point of intervention to improve clinical and cognitive outcomes after injury.", "Developing an abstractive text summarization (ATS) system that is capable of generating concise, appropriate, and plausible summaries for the source documents is a long-term goal of artificial intelligence (AI). Recent advances in ATS are overwhelmingly contributed by deep learning techniques, which have taken the state-of-the-art of ATS to a new level. Despite the significant success of previous methods, generating high-quality and human-like abstractive summaries remains a challenge in practice. The human reading cognition, which is essential for reading comprehension and logical thinking, is still relatively new territory and underexplored in deep neural networks. In this article, we propose a novel Hierarchical Human-like deep neural network for ATS (HH-ATS), inspired by the process of how humans comprehend an article and write the corresponding summary. Specifically, HH-ATS is composed of three primary components (i.e., a knowledge-aware hierarchical attention module, a multitask learning module, and a dual discriminator generative adversarial network), which mimic the three stages of human reading cognition (i.e., rough reading, active reading, and postediting). Experimental results on two benchmark data sets (CNN/Daily Mail and Gigaword) demonstrate that HH-ATS consistently and substantially outperforms the compared methods.", "Computational biomechanics via finite element analysis (FEA) has long promised a means of assessing patient-specific abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture risk with greater efficacy than current clinically used size-based criteria. The pursuit stems from the notion that AAA rupture occurs when wall stress exceeds wall strength. Quantification of peak (maximum) wall stress (PWS) has been at the cornerstone of this research, with numerous studies having demonstrated that PWS better differentiates ruptured AAAs from non-ruptured AAAs. In contrast to wall stress models, which have become progressively more sophisticated, there has been relatively little progress in estimating patient-specific wall strength. This is because wall strength cannot be inferred non-invasively, and measurements from excised patient tissues show a large spectrum of wall strength values. In this review, we highlight studies that investigated the relationship between biomechanics and AAA rupture risk. We conclude that combining wall stress and wall strength approximations should provide better estimations of AAA rupture risk. However, before personalized biomechanical AAA risk assessment can become a reality, better methods for estimating patient-specific wall properties or surrogate markers of aortic wall degradation are needed. Artificial intelligence methods can be key in stratifying patients, leading to personalized AAA risk assessment.", "Bio-inspired nano-electronic devices are key instruments for the development of advanced artificial intelligence systems, which will shape the future of humanoid nano-robotics. An emerging demand is realized for an accurate reception of environmental stimuli via visual perception, processing and realization of optical signals. The present study demonstrates the capability of functionalized all-oxide heterostructured two-dimensional (2D) plasmonic devices for the self-adaptive recognition of visual optical pulses. Specifically, the nano-engineering of the metal/semiconductor interface and co-modulation of heterostructured 2D semiconductor hetero-interfaces of Au/WO3\u2009:\u2009TiO2 and Au/Ga2O3\u2009:\u2009TiO2 facilitated the receptive and nociceptive detection of visible light pulses. A decrease in the dark current of the Au/WO3\u2009:\u2009TiO2 unit resulted in the development of sensitive visible light photoreceptors. Furthermore, the modulation of charge transfers at the Au/Ga2O3\u2009:\u2009TiO2 hetero-interfaces were the key parameter to determine the optical reception characteristics and nociceptive performance of all-oxide optoelectronic devices. Specifically, the rapid thermal annealing (RTA) of 2D Ga2O3 in N2 atmosphere ensured the modulation of charge transfer at Au/Ga2O3\u2009:\u2009TiO2 hetero-interfaces in plasmonic devices. Thus, hetero-interface engineering enabled the effective control of charge transfer at 2D hetero-interfaces for an adaptive perception of visible optical pulses. Consequently, the fabricated sensitive Au/Ga2O3 (N2)\u2009:\u2009TiO2 bio-inspired unit emulated the optical functionalities of corneal nociceptors.", "Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has resulted in the collection of massive amounts of clinical data. In ophthalmology in particular, the volume range of data captured in EHR systems has been growing rapidly. Yet making effective secondary use of this EHR data for improving patient care and facilitating clinical decision-making has remained challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of these data. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques present a promising way to analyze these multimodal data sets. While AI techniques have been extensively applied to imaging data, there are a limited number of studies employing AI techniques with clinical data from the EHR. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of different AI methods applied to EHR data in the field of ophthalmology. This literature review highlights that the secondary use of EHR data has focused on glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts with the use of AI techniques. These techniques have been used to improve ocular disease diagnosis, risk assessment, and progression prediction. Techniques such as supervised machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing were most commonly used in the articles reviewed.", "In many cardiovascular pathologies, the shape and motion of the heart provide important clues to understanding the mechanisms of the disease and how it progresses over time. With the advent of large-scale cardiac data, statistical modeling of cardiac anatomy has become a powerful tool to provide automated, precise quantification of the status of patient-specific heart geometry with respect to reference populations. Powered by supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms, statistical cardiac shape analysis can be used to automatically identify and quantify the severity of heart diseases, to provide morphometric indices that are optimally associated with clinical factors, and to evaluate the likelihood of adverse outcomes. Recently, statistical cardiac atlases have been integrated with deep neural networks to enable anatomical consistency of cardiac segmentation, registration, and automated quality control. These combinations have already shown significant improvements in performance and avoid gross anatomical errors that could make the results unusable. This current trend is expected to grow in the near future. Here, we aim to provide a mini review highlighting recent advances in statistical atlasing of cardiac function in the context of artificial intelligence in cardiac imaging.", "As a critical driving power to promote health care, the health care-related artificial intelligence (AI) literature is growing rapidly.\nThe purpose of this analysis is to provide a dynamic and longitudinal bibliometric analysis of health care-related AI publications.\nThe Web of Science (Clarivate PLC) was searched to retrieve all existing and highly cited AI-related health care research papers published in English up to December 2019. Based on bibliometric indicators, a search strategy was developed to screen the title for eligibility, using the abstract and full text where needed. The growth rate of publications, characteristics of research activities, publication patterns, and research hotspot tendencies were computed using the HistCite software.\nThe search identified 5235 hits, of which 1473 publications were included in the analyses. Publication output increased an average of 17.02% per year since 1995, but the growth rate of research papers significantly increased to 45.15% from 2014 to 2019. The major health problems studied in AI research are cancer, depression, Alzheimer disease, heart failure, and diabetes. Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks have the highest impact on health care. Nucleosides, convolutional neural networks, and tumor markers have remained research hotspots through 2019.\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-related research conducted in the field of health care, which helps researchers, policy makers, and practitioners better understand the development of health care-related AI research and possible practice implications. Future AI research should be dedicated to filling in the gaps between AI health care research and clinical applications.", "Artificial intelligence has rapidly evolved from the experimental phase to the implementation phase in many image-driven clinical disciplines, including ophthalmology. A combination of the increasing availability of large datasets and computing power with revolutionary progress in deep learning has created unprecedented opportunities for major breakthrough improvements in the performance and accuracy of automated diagnoses that primarily focus on image recognition and feature detection. Such an automated disease classification would significantly improve the accessibility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of eye care systems where it is less dependent on human input, potentially enabling diagnosis to be cheaper, quicker, and more consistent. Although this technology will have a profound impact on clinical flow and practice patterns sooner or later, translating such a technology into clinical practice is challenging and requires similar levels of accountability and effectiveness as any new medication or medical device due to the potential problems of bias, and ethical, medical, and legal issues that might arise. The objective of this review is to summarize the opportunities and challenges of this transition and to facilitate the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into routine clinical practice based on our best understanding and experience in this area.", "In this article, we review the current state of artificial intelligence applications in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and provide insight on challenges as well as strategies for bringing these algorithms to the bedside.\nIn the past few years, there has been a dramatic shift from machine learning approaches based on feature extraction to 'deep' convolutional neural networks for artificial intelligence applications. Several artificial intelligence for ROP approaches have demonstrated adequate proof-of-concept performance in research studies. The next steps are to determine whether these algorithms are robust to variable clinical and technical parameters in practice. Integration of artificial intelligence into ROP screening and treatment is limited by generalizability of the algorithms to maintain performance on unseen data and integration of artificial intelligence technology into new or existing clinical workflows.\nReal-world implementation of artificial intelligence for ROP diagnosis will require massive efforts targeted at developing standards for data acquisition, true external validation, and demonstration of feasibility. We must now focus on ethical, technical, clinical, regulatory, and financial considerations to bring this technology to the infant bedside to realize the promise offered by this technology to reduce preventable blindness from ROP.", "This article presents a mapping review of the literature concerning the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care. The goal of this review is to summarise current debates and identify open questions for future research. Five literature databases were searched to support the following research question: how can the primary ethical risks presented by AI-health be categorised, and what issues must policymakers, regulators and developers consider in order to be 'ethically mindful? A series of screening stages were carried out-for example, removing articles that focused on digital health in general (e.g. data sharing, data access, data privacy, surveillance/nudging, consent, ownership of health data, evidence of efficacy)-yielding a total of 156 papers that were included in the review. We find that ethical issues can be (a) epistemic, related to misguided, inconclusive or inscrutable evidence; (b) normative, related to unfair outcomes and transformative effectives; or (c) related to traceability. We further find that these ethical issues arise at six levels of abstraction: individual, interpersonal, group, institutional, and societal or sectoral. Finally, we outline a number of considerations for policymakers and regulators, mapping these to existing literature, and categorising each as epistemic, normative or traceability-related and at the relevant level of abstraction. Our goal is to inform policymakers, regulators and developers of what they must consider if they are to enable health and care systems to capitalise on the dual advantage of ethical AI; maximising the opportunities to cut costs, improve care, and improve the efficiency of health and care systems, whilst proactively avoiding the potential harms. We argue that if action is not swiftly taken in this regard, a new 'AI winter' could occur due to chilling effects related to a loss of public trust in the benefits of AI for health care.", "What factors determine success at University? For many years the construct of intelligence was felt to be critical. More recently, the construct of grit, has attracted the attention of many researchers, along with related concepts such as self-control, growth mind-sets and resilience. The authors of this paper have developed a specific measure of tenacity and self-composure, two constructs crucial to academic achievement. This measure comprises of 12 items drawn from the above constructs, but also including mental well-being and strengths use. In the first study, the authors report on the psychometric properties of the Bolton Uni-Stride Scale (BUSS). The new scale was administered to 1117 university students. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed two underlying factors, one labelled \"tenacity\" had seven items and accounted for 30% of the variance. The second was labelled \"self-composure,\" and accounted for 14% of the variance. In the second study the BUSS was given to 340 undergraduate students along with the Grit Scale, the Self-Control Scale, the Mind-sets Quiz, the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10) and the short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). This study presented evidence for good internal consistency reliability (.74) and test-retest reliability over three weeks was .70 for Tenacity and .77 for Self-composure. BUSS Academic Tenacity correlated highly with grit (.63), self-control (.59), resilience (.52), mind-sets (.35) and mental well-being (.54). The study also evidences good discriminative validity of the BUSS. A second study conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), explaining a total of 44% of the variance. The authors have shown good support for the reliability and validity of the BUSS scale. It now needs to be tested in other universities and in different countries. It is the contention of the authors that academic tenacity will be a better measure of academic success than other competing measures, such as grit, on their own. Further research is needed to test this assertion.", "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous entity of B-cell lymphoma. Cell-of-origin (COO) classification of DLBCL is required in routine practice by the World Health Organization classification for biological and therapeutic insights. Genetic subtypes uncovered recently are based on distinct genetic alterations in DLBCL, which are different from the COO subtypes defined by gene expression signatures of normal B cells retained in DLBCL. We hypothesize that classifiers incorporating both genome-wide gene-expression and pathogenetic variables can improve the therapeutic significance of DLBCL classification. To develop such refined classifiers, we performed targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with a commercially available next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform in a large cohort of 418 DLBCLs. Genetic and transcriptional data obtained by RNA-Seq in a single run were explored by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a NGS-COO classifier for COO assignment and NGS survival models for clinical outcome prediction. The NGS-COO model built through applying AI in the training set was robust, showing high concordance with COO classification by either Affymetrix GeneChip microarray or the NanoString Lymph2Cx assay in 2 validation sets. Although the NGS-COO model was not trained for clinical outcome, the activated B-cell-like compared with the germinal-center B-cell-like subtype had significantly poorer survival. The NGS survival models stratified 30% high-risk patients in the validation set with poor survival as in the training set. These results demonstrate that targeted RNA-Seq coupled with AI deep learning techniques provides reproducible, efficient, and affordable assays for clinical application. The clinical grade assays and NGS models integrating both genetic and transcriptional factors developed in this study may eventually support precision medicine in DLBCL.", "Psychotic-like experiences (PLE) are present in nonclinical populations, yet their association with brain structural variation, especially markers of early neurodevelopment, is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that cortical surface gyrification, a putative marker of early brain development, is associated with PLE in healthy subjects.\nWe analyzed gyrification from 3 Tesla MRI scans (using CAT12 software) and PLE (positive, negative, and depressive symptom dimensions derived from the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences, CAPE) in 103 healthy participants (49 females, mean age 29.13 \u00b1 9.37 years). A subsample of 63 individuals completed tasks from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and Controlled Oral Word Association Test. Estimated IQ and a composite neuropsychological score were used to explore mediation pathways via cognition.\nPositive PLE distress was negatively associated with gyrification of the left precuneus. PLE depression dimension showed a negative association with gyrification in the right supramarginal and temporal region. There was no significant mediating effect of cognition on these associations.\nOur results support a neurobiological psychosis spectrum, for the first time linking an early developmental imaging marker (rather than volume) to dimensional subclinical psychotic symptoms. While schizophrenia risk, neurodevelopment, and cognitive function might share genetic risk factors, additional mediation analyses did not confirm a mediating effect of cognition on the gyrification-psychopathology correlation.", "Cognitive performance has been studied in adults with\u00a0obsessive-compulsive symptoms\u00a0(OCS) and in adult relatives of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Meanwhile, few studies have been conducted with children under the same conditions. This study compared the\u00a0neurocognitive domains previously associated with dysfunction in\u00a0OCD, especially visuoconstructive ability, visuospatial memory, executive functions, and intelligence, in children and adolescents at high risk (HR) for OCD (n\u2009=\u200918) and non-OCD controls (NOC) (n\u2009=\u200931).\nFor the HR group, we considered the first-degree relatives of patients with OCD that present OCS, but do not meet diagnostic criteria for OCD. Psychiatric diagnosis was assessed by experienced clinicians using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and OCS severity was measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Neurocognitive assessment was performed with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Performance on the cognitive domains was compared between groups using Multivariate Analysis of Variance, whereas performance on the neuropsychological variables was compared between groups using independent t-tests in a cognitive subdomain analysis.\nThe cognitive domain analysis revealed a trend towards significance for impairments in the motor and processing speed domain (p\u2009=\u20090.019; F\u2009=\u20093.12) in the HR group. Moreover, the cognitive subdomain analysis identified a statistically significant underperformance in spatial working memory in the HR group when compared to the NOC group (p\u2009=\u20090.005; t\u2009=\u2009-\u20092.94), and a trend towards significance for impairments in non-verbal memory and visuoconstructive tasks in the HR group.\nOur results suggest impairments in spatial working memory and motor and processing speed in a non-clinical sample of HR participants. Considering the preliminary nature of our findings, further studies investigating these neurocognitive domains as potential predictors of pediatric OCD are warranted.", "Intelligence analysis is fundamentally an exercise in expert judgment made under conditions of uncertainty. These judgments are used to inform consequential decisions. Following the major intelligence failure that led to the 2003 war in Iraq, intelligence organizations implemented policies for communicating probability in their assessments. Virtually all chose to convey probability using standardized linguistic lexicons in which an ordered set of select probability terms (e.g., highly likely) is associated with numeric ranges (e.g., 80-90%). We review the benefits and drawbacks of this approach, drawing on psychological research on probability communication and studies that have examined the effectiveness of standardized lexicons. We further discuss how numeric probabilities can overcome many of the shortcomings of linguistic probabilities. Numeric probabilities are not without drawbacks (e.g., they are more difficult to elicit and may be misunderstood by receivers with poor numeracy). However, these drawbacks can be ameliorated with training and practice, whereas the pitfalls of linguistic probabilities are endemic to the approach. We propose that, on balance, the benefits of using numeric probabilities outweigh their drawbacks. Given the enormous costs associated with intelligence failure, the intelligence community should reconsider its reliance on using linguistic probabilities to convey probability in intelligence assessments. Our discussion also has implications for probability communication in other domains such as climate science.

Previous research has shown several relationships among these variables and family quality of life, however results are contradictories.\nTo examine the role of psychological adaptation (including emotional symptoms, behavioral problems, hyperactivity, problems with peers, and prosocial behavior) in children with ASD and typical development, and its impact on family quality of life.\nTwenty-four families of children with ASD (level 1 of support) and 25 families of children with typical development between 6 and 13 years old. We have considered diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (following DSM-IV-TR) with ASD-level 1 of support (following DSM-5). We have evaluated intelligence, vocabulary, adaptive behavior, and family quality of life.\nWe have found significant differences in those variables related to psychological adaptation, and in some components of the family quality of life (family interaction, physical and emotional wellbeing). In our regression model, prosocial behaviors and the group were the main predictors of satisfaction on family quality of life.\nIt is important to pay attention to the prosocial behaviors in ASD due to its potential protective effect.\nConducta adaptativa en ni\u00f1os con trastorno del espectro autista y su efecto sobre la calidad de vida familiar.\nIntroducci\u00f3n.

While pointing out the inherent Western bias in these systems, it highlights the potential of misuse of these systems to subserve other agendas. It raises concerns about the reliability, validity, comorbidity, and heterogeneity within diagnostic categories of contemporary classification systems.

The participants were 845 students from Morocco (372 boys, 473 girls; mean age 15.58 years; SD = 1.69; range = 13-18) who were attending secondary education (79.8%) or high school. The participants completed a questionnaire that included scales to measure the variables of interest, adapted for and validated in Moroccan adolescents. A multiple mediation serial model with four mediator variables confirmed that academic self-concept was positively and directly predicted by EI, academic performance, and social support, whereas test anxiety and depression had a negative effect. Second, EI predicted self-concept through its indirect effects on test anxiety and academic performance, social support, and depression. EI was the most protective factor. This model has good performance in explaining the variation in test anxiety (1.6%), depression (14.2%), social support (9.5%), academic performance (6.8%), and self-concept (35.7%). This study helps clarify the relationship of positive and negative socioemotional states with the academic performance of adolescents in Morocco. This study contributes to the literature by enhancing knowledge of adolescents in societies that, like Morocco, have a less elaborated tradition at these levels of education and that are considering education in their agenda as a way of enhancing national development and promoting EI to allow youth development in a healthier society.", "Deficits in facial emotion recognition and Theory of Mind are frequent in patients with epilepsy. Although this evidence, studies on pediatric age are few and the relation between these abilities and other cognitive domain remains to be better elucidated. The purpose of our study is to evaluate facial emotion recognition and Theory of Mind in children and adolescents with focal epilepsy, and correlate them with intelligence and executive functions.\nOur work is a cross-sectional observational study. Sixty-two children and adolescents aged between 7-16 years diagnosed by focal epilepsy and 32 sex/age-matched controls were recruited. All participants were administered a standardized battery tests to assess social cognition (NEPSY-II), executive functions (EpiTrack Junior) and cognitive non-verbal level (Raven Progressive Matrices).\nEmotion recognition mean score was significantly lower in the epilepsy group than in the controls to Student's t-test (p<0.05). Epilepsy group showed an impairment in happiness, sadness, anger and fear recognition, compared to controls (p<0.05). Theory of Mind mean score was also significantly lower in epilepsy group than controls (p<0.05). Deficits in emotion recognition seemed to be related to low age at onset of epilepsy, long duration of disease, low executive functions and low non-verbal intelligence. Deficits in Theory of Mind seemed to be related to a high seizure frequency.\nOur results suggest that children and adolescents with focal epilepsy had deficit in facial emotion recognition and Theory of Mind, compared to their peer. Both these difficulties seem to be related to some features of epilepsy itself. Our results also suggest that deficits in facial emotion recognition are potentially related to difficulties in executive functions and non-verbal intelligence. More studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses.", "In the clinical diagnosis of epileptic diseases, the intelligent diagnosis of epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has become a research focus in the field of brain diseases. In order to solve the problem of time-consuming and easily influenced by human subjective factors, artificial intelligence pattern recognition algorithm has been applied to EEG signals recognition. However, at present, the common empirical mode decomposition (EMD) signal decomposition algorithm does not consider the problem of mode aliasing. The EEG features obtained by feature extraction may be mixed with some unimportant features that affect the classification accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a new method based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) combined with iterative feature reduction for aided diagnosis of epileptic EEG. First of all, the evaluation indexes of decomposing and reconstructing signals by several methods were compared. The CEEMD was selected as the decomposition method of the signals. Then, the support vector machine recursive elimination (SVM-RFE) was used to reduce 9 features extracted from EEG data. The support vector classification of the gray wolf optimizer (GWO-SVC) recognition model was established for different feature subsets. By comparing the classification accuracy of training set and test set of different feature subsets, and considering the complexity of the model reflected by the number of features selected by SVM-RFE, the analysis showed that the 6 feature subsets with fewer features and higher classification accuracy could reflect the key information of epileptic EEG. The accuracy of the training set classification was 99.38% and the test set was as high as 100%. The recognition time was only 1.6551 s. Finally, in order to verify the reliability of the algorithm proposed in this paper, the proposed algorithm compared with the classification model established by the raw EEG signals and the optimization model established by other intelligent optimization algorithms. It is found that the algorithm used in this paper has higher classification accuracy and faster recognition time than other processing methods. The experimental results show that CEEMD combined with SVM-RFE is feasible for rapid and accurate recognition of EEG signals, which provides a theoretical basis for the aided diagnosis of epilepsy.", "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, in particular, have gained significant interest in many fields, including pharmaceutical sciences. The enormous growth of data from several sources, the recent advances in various analytical tools, and the continuous developments in machine learning algorithms have resulted in a rapid increase in new machine learning applications in different areas of pharmaceutical sciences. This review summarizes the past, present, and potential future impacts of machine learning technologies on different areas of pharmaceutical sciences, including drug design and discovery, preformulation, and formulation. The machine learning methods commonly used in pharmaceutical sciences are discussed, with a specific emphasis on artificial neural networks due to their capability to model the nonlinear relationships that are commonly encountered in pharmaceutical research. AI and machine learning technologies in common day-to-day pharma needs as well as industrial and regulatory insights are reviewed. Beyond traditional potentials of implementing digital technologies using machine learning in the development of more efficient, fast, and economical solutions in pharmaceutical sciences are also discussed.", "The O'Donnell-Luria-Rodan (ODLURO) syndrome, caused by heterozygous mutation in the lysine N-methyltransferase2E (KMT2E) gene in chromosome 7q22, has been recently described. Mutation of KMT2E produces a protein-truncating variant gene that may be responsible for both developmental delay and intellectual disability disorders commonly defined by an Intelligence Quotient\u2009<\u200970 and usually unspecific pathologic brain features demonstrated by brain Magnetic Resonance imaging. The symptoms of ODLURO syndrome include variably developmental and speech delay, autism, seizures, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. The aim of the study is to search for correlation between this specific gene mutation and clinical/radiological features, trying to provide new insights in this recently described pathological condition.\nWe reviewed the 38 cases collected by O'Donnel-Luria et al., adding three cases of a familial heterozygosis novel mutation in KMT2E gene; different degrees of neurological disorder, subtle dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and various brain Magnetic Resonance features are described.\nMagnetic Resonance data were integrated by genetic analysis and clinical features. Brain Magnetic Resonance study of our patients confirmed peculiar pathologic features previously reported in ODLURO syndrome; cerebellar dysplasia was identified in one of them. All 3 patients had epilepsy, intellectual disability, and mild dysmorphisms.\nOur study adds 3 new patients genetically, clinically, and radiologically evaluated to the ODLURO syndrome case series. While CC hypoplasia and widening of subarachnoid spaces are already reported in literature, we document for the first time the presence of cerebellar dysplasia in ODLURO syndrome. We also highlight the extremely low IQ value and the presence of epilepsy in all 3 patients.", "Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving technique for training a vast amount of decentralized data and making inferences on mobile devices. As a typical language modeling problem, mobile keyboard prediction aims at suggesting a probable next word or phrase and facilitating the human-machine interaction in a virtual keyboard of the smartphone or laptop. Mobile keyboard prediction with FL hopes to satisfy the growing demand that high-level data privacy be preserved in artificial intelligence applications even with the distributed models training. However, there are two major problems in the federated optimization for the prediction: (1) aggregating model parameters on the server-side and (2) reducing communication costs caused by model weights collection. To address the above issues, traditional FL methods simply use averaging aggregation or ignore communication costs. We propose a novel Federated Mediation (FedMed) framework with the adaptive aggregation, mediation incentive scheme, and topK strategy to address the model aggregation and communication costs. The performance is evaluated in terms of perplexity and communication rounds. Experiments are conducted on three datasets (i.e., Penn Treebank, WikiText-2, and Yelp) and the results demonstrate that our FedMed framework achieves robust performance and outperforms baseline approaches.", "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness worldwide. The diagnosis of ROP is subclassified by zone, stage, and plus disease, with each area demonstrating significant intra- and interexpert subjectivity and disagreement. In addition to improved efficiencies for ROP screening, artificial intelligence may lead to automated, quantifiable, and objective diagnosis in ROP. This review focuses on the development of artificial intelligence for automated diagnosis of plus disease in ROP and highlights the clinical and technical challenges of both the development and implementation of artificial intelligence in the real world.", "The clinical management of COVID-19 is challenging. Medical imaging plays a critical role in the early detection, clinical monitoring and outcomes assessment of this disease. Chest x-ray radiography and computed tomography) are the standard imaging modalities used for the structural assessment of the disease status, while functional imaging (namely, positron emission tomography) has had limited application. Artificial intelligence can enhance the predictive power and utilization of these imaging approaches and new approaches focusing on detection, stratification and prognostication are showing encouraging results. We review the current landscape of these imaging modalities and artificial intelligence approaches as applied in COVID-19 management.", "We predict mechanical ventilation requirement and mortality using computational modeling of chest radiographs (CXRs) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. This two-center, retrospective study analyzed 530 deidentified CXRs from 515 COVID-19 patients treated at Stony Brook University Hospital and Newark Beth Israel Medical Center between March and August 2020. DL and machine learning classifiers to predict mechanical ventilation requirement and mortality were trained and evaluated using patient CXRs. A novel radiomic embedding framework was also explored for outcome prediction. All results are compared against radiologist grading of CXRs (zone-wise expert severity scores). Radiomic and DL classification models had mAUCs of 0.78+/-0.02 and 0.81+/-0.04, compared with expert scores mAUCs of 0.75+/-0.02 and 0.79+/-0.05 for mechanical ventilation requirement and mortality prediction, respectively. Combined classifiers using both radiomics and expert severity scores resulted in mAUCs of 0.79+/-0.04 and 0.83+/-0.04 for each prediction task, demonstrating improvement over either artificial intelligence or radiologist interpretation alone. Our results also suggest instances where inclusion of radiomic features in DL improves model predictions, something that might be explored in other pathologies. The models proposed in this study and the prognostic information they provide might aid physician decision making and resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Intelligence assessment is an integral part of a comprehensive autism evaluation. Many past studies have described a cognitive profile of autistic individuals characterized by higher nonverbal than verbal IQ scores. The diagnostic utility of this profile, however, remains unknown. We leveraged receiver operating characteristic methods to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of three different IQ profiles in a large sample of children who have an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (N = 1,228, Simons Simplex Collection) who completed the Differential Ability Scales-Second Edition (DAS-II), School Age compared to the normative sample provided by the DAS-II publisher (N = 2,200). The frequently discussed nonverbal > verbal IQ profile performed near chance at distinguishing ASD from normative individuals (AUC: 0.54, 95% CI [0.52-0.56]), and performed significantly worse for females than males (AUC: females: 0.46 [0.41-0.52]; males: 0.55 [0.53-0.58]). All cognitive profiles showed AUC\u2009<\u20090.56. We conclude that while significant differences between verbal and nonverbal IQ scores exist at the group level, these differences are small in an absolute sense and not meaningful at an individual level. We do not recommend using cognitive profiles to aid in autism diagnostic decision-making. LAY SUMMARY: Some researchers and clinicians have reported an \"autistic cognitive profile\" of higher nonverbal intelligence than verbal intelligence. In an analysis of over 1,000 autistic children, we found that the group's average nonverbal intelligence is usually higher than their verbal intelligence. However, this pattern should not be used by clinicians to make an individual diagnosis of autism because our results show it is not helpful nor accurate.", "The potential benefits of autonomous systems are obvious. However, there are still major issues to be dealt with before developing such systems becomes a commonplace engineering practice, with accepted and trustworthy deliverables. We argue that a solid, evolving, publicly available, community-controlled foundation for developing next-generation autonomous systems is a must, and term the desired foundation \"autonomics.\" We focus on three main challenges: 1) how to specify autonomous system behavior in the face of unpredictability; 2) how to carry out faithful analysis of system behavior with respect to rich environments that include humans, physical artifacts, and other systems; and 3) how to build such systems by combining executable modeling techniques from software engineering with artificial intelligence and machine learning.", "Acupuncture is an ancient therapeutic method based on the theory of Chinese medicine (CM). Traditional acupuncture has many limitations; it is subjective and relies more on the experience of an acupuncturist, and the efficacy is sometimes irreproducible. In contrast, electroacupuncture (EA) has special characteristics in terms of objectivity and stability, thereby gaining considerable attention. Parameter setting plays a crucial role in EA practice. The current paper summarizes the current situation and limitations of parameter setting in EA practice. Objectification is the tendency and future of CM as well as EA. With the development of computerized technologies, such as wearable sensors, vast data, and artificial intelligence, CM syndromes can be successfully objectified. We propose the development of a novel self-feedback-adjust EA system, which may improve the parameter setting in EA and be beneficial to both the patients and clinicians."], "authior": [[["Bai Y G"],
